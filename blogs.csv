This small country is full of great cities and towns to visit, so be sure to allow a couple of weeks to see all Slovenia has to offer. To help you plan your visit, these are the places you must visit in Slovenia! The capital city of Slovenia has such an old-world appeal that it almost doesn’t feel like a city at all. Ljubljana is incredibly picturesque and full of vibrance. The summer months bring a lot of locals outside on to the alfresco dining tables that line the river, as well as hidden gardens and terraces behind closed doors. Be sure to wander your way up to the castle for a complete view over the city below. Just a short drive from Ljubljana is Kranj, Slovenia’s fourth largest city that still maintains a small town feel. The kokra river runs through the city and with the mountains as a backdrop, this city skyline is one of the most photogenic in all of Slovenia. The old town is a protected cultural monument but the real beauty of this city is the underground tunnel system you can explore at great length. Skofja Loka is just a short car drive from Ljubljana and has a much more quaint, charming appeal. This sleepy town sits on the Sora river and has an imposing caste overlooking the town from above. This is the perfect day trip from Ljubljana and will take only 1-2 hours to explore. There’s hardly a traveller who would visit Slovenia without stopping at Bled to see the famous Lake Bled. Outside of the lake, there is much more to explore in Bled – including nearby Vintgar Gorge and neighbouring towns. Of all the places you must visit in Slovenia, this has to be on your list! Piran is Slovenia’s resort city on the Adriatic coast. The town is as picturesque as a postcard, especially with its strongly influenced Venetian architecture. Tartini Square is the heart and soul of this city and one of the liveliest squares on the coast. A small town in the southwest of Slovenia, Postojna has long been famous for its impressive underground cave system and the nearby Predjama castle built in to the cliff. This small city in the southeast of the country is surrounded by the Krka River, making it an idyllic town from above. This part of the country is much less visited by tourists and thus Novo Mesto is a great destination if you’re looking to meet more locals and feel like one yourself. Over to you! Where are you visiting in Slovenia this summer?"
1,"Tuscany is one of my favourite destinations in not just Italy, but all of Europe. The rolling hills, the endless vineyards, the magnificent cheese, wine, gelato – the list is truly endless. Full of character, greenery and lively locals, here is a complete guide to where to visit in Tuscany to help plan your adventure! With direct flights in to Pisa from the rest of the world (with Qatar airways via Doha), you might as well start your Tuscan adventure in the city of Pisa. Pisa is of course most well-known for its architectural failure, the leaning tower of Pisa. Beyond that, be sure to wander the streets to discover the true charm of this city. Make your way over to the Arno river for beautiful views morning and night and be sure to grab a gelato or two for a sugar hit to make it through the day!  From Pisa make your way to nearby Lucca, a small but charming city with plenty to see and do. You’ll need at least half a day here, though could easily spend a full day or two exploring the sights and meandering the small alleyways. For the best view of the city, be sure to climb the Guinigi Tower, complete with a gorgeous garden on top and offering panoramic views of Lucca. Be sure to try the buccellato (rasin bread), a local delicacy found at most bakeries in the city. It just wouldn’t be a trip to Tuscany without visiting Florence! As one of my all time favourite cities not just in Europe but the entire world, you absolutely must make a visit to Florence for a few days. Full of mesmerising history, art, culture and great food (where in Italy doesn’t have great food!?), this is one of the world’s most charming and endlessly fascinating cities. You’ll need at least three days here, though could easily spend up to a week visiting the many monuments, museums and meandering the streets. Read more: The best day trips from Florence A small and unassuming town, San Gimignano sits on top of a large hill overlooking the hills of Tuscany. In terms of great views, those atop the tower in San Gimignano are some of the best you will find. You’ll need at least a day to explore the small town on foot, though could easily spend a couple of days using this as a base to explore the countryside. Wineries (as always in Tuscany) are just a stones throw away! One of my favourite cities in Tuscany that I only just discovered on my August ’16 trip is Siena. With so much wealth accumulated over years of successful banking, the city maintains an element of grandeur every which way you like: from the Cuomo to the City Hall. You could aim to see Siena in a day, though I would suggest at least two days here to explore as there is much to discover! Cortona – where “Under the Tuscan Sun” was filmed Elba – seaside Tuscany Livorno – canals, seaside escape  I flew to Tuscany on a direct route with Qatar Airways. Flying from Australia, this meant just two flights to reach the Tuscan region: Melbourne – Doha & Doha – Pisa. I would highly recommend this route for travellers interested in basing their trip in Tuscany, a region that warrants at least one, but up to three weeks to discover. With thanks to Qatar Airways for welcoming me to experience Tuscany on this new direct route! See more of my adventures on Instagram."
2,"The Parisian picnic is a fine art. Not to be taken lightly, it takes the right amount of preparation, thought and planning to master the perfect picnic like the Parisians manage to every time. Knowing the best locations, which cheeses to bring and how much bread will be needed are all fundamental factors in a make or break picnic. Be savvy, read this guide for all the tips and tricks and picnic like a true Parisian. Who knows someone might even mistake you for a Parisian yourself…  First things first, location is the most important factor when it comes to picnicking in Paris. Many flock to the banks of the Seine for the views, the atmosphere and the crowds of people. My favourite picnic spot in Paris is the Square du Vert- Galant, I always try to get there early enough to pinch the spot where the island ends and take in the magical view of Pont des Arts with my feet dangling over the river Seine. Favourite daytime picnic locations include the Bagatelle park, Buttes Chaumont park and the Monceau park. Favourite evening picnic locations include underneath Pont Alexandre III, anywhere on Il St Louis and the aforementioned Square du Vert- Galant.  The three main components of a picnic in Paris are without a doubt bread, cheese and wine. Or… du pain, du fromage et du vin! Fortunately Paris is abundant in bakeries so finding a freshly baked baguette will not prove a problem. Ensure to bring a generous armful of baguettes if there’s a group of you, I guarantee you will eat more bread than you think.  What would a picnic be without cheese? Next stop and equally as important as the last is the cheese monger. Buy a creamy camembert, a rich goats cheese and some compté from the local market or the local fromagerie and I promise you that you’ll earn big brownie points with your fellow picnickers, just don’t forget the knife! (Photo by Luxeat)  You can count on the wine flowing freely at a Parisian picnic and no one would have it any other way. Red is the more sensible choice if it’s to your taste as you don’t have to worry about it getting warm and there are plenty of reds which make the perfect accompaniment to cheese, if you match them well. Make sure to bring some plastic cups or even plastic wine glasses, if you want your picnic to be a classy affair.  The best way to travel to your chosen picnic spot is by bike. Hire a Vélib and fill the basket with your recently purchased treats and cycle with the wind in your hair to meet your friends. There is no better way to arrive at your picnic destination than by Vélib, you’ll arrive feeling refreshed, excited and unbelievably fortunate to be in Paris. Once more there aren’t many metro stops close to the Seine but there are dozens of Vélib stations.  If you want to look as though you’ve got picnicking down to a fine art, ensure to bring a cork screw for the bottle of wine. I guarantee you will immediately gain the respect of every surrounding Parisian, or better yet fool them into believing you’re not an expat/tourist. Alternatively buy a screw bottle and save yourself a lot of agro and possible embarrassment.  For a truly magical picnic, make sure to get to your chosen destination before the sunset to catch the sun sinking into the horizon. Watching the last rays of sun softly flicker and dance off the river Seine will ensure your picnic is one to remember.  If you choose to picnic in the evening, chances are you’ll be staying late into the night because the wine is still flowing and there are still baguettes abound after coming well prepared. Also, you’ll want to see the city turn from dusk to dark and catch the Eiffel Tower sparkle as many times as possible before midnight. In which case, come prepared and bring a jumper and a blanket to wrap up warm when the temperature starts to drop.  Dessert needn’t ever be prepared from scratch in Paris. Parisians are big fans of economising on time and leaving certain tasks for those who do them better. Baking is one of them. What Parisian need ever bake when there are dozens of pastry shops creating superior pastries? Leave it to the experts and pick up a box en route. Alternatively pass by your local market for fresh fruits and berries instead.   Photography and words by Faye Bullock"
3,"On my latest visit to Paris, I finally made my way to the Palais Garnier, also known as Paris’ famous Opera House. While I’ve been visiting Paris for years now (it is after all my favourite city in the world), for one reason or another, I was still yet to step foot inside. But visiting the Palais Garnier has long been on my Paris to do list, and here’s why it should be on yours, too! For a little back story, the Palais Garnier is a master piece of 19th century theater art architecture. It is without a doubt one of the most beautiful architectural structures in Paris, and one of the most beautiful theatres in Europe. There are 1,979 seats inside the opera house at the Place de l’Opéra. While it is still operational today, tickets can be hard to come by for ballets and operas (not to mention expensive!) If you are interested in the architecture itself like I was, you can visit during the day for a guided tour. This is a great way to roam the interiors and learn the history of the opera house, without the expensive ticket price. The Palais Garnier was built as the official Paris Opera House from 1861 to 1875. It was commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III. It gained international notoriety when it was used as the backdrop for Gaston Leroux’s 1910 novel The Phantom of the Opera. I visited the Palais Garnier as a day guest given my interest was more in the building itself than seeing a show. This is the best way to roam the interiors at great length, as well as learning the history. In the evening there are performances, however you can expect more crowds before and after shows. Visiting in the morning is the best time to see the Palais Garnier. There are fewer crowds and a beautiful morning light pours in through the massive windows. The best way to see the Opera House is to join a guided tour. We opted for a private two-hour tour to really get to know the ins and outs of the building. After all, I feel like I owed the Palais Garnier at least that after taking so long to finally visit! This is easily one of my favourite tours I have booked in the city of Paris. While I love seeing the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe, I really felt like I got a better history of the city itself on this tour. There’s so much to learn every time I visit Paris that it just never gets old! You will also learn more about the boulevards and grandeur of the city while on the tour. From Monday to Sunday, from 10am to 7pm and until the end of performances. Access from street Havély or from the theatre public areas. Full rate: €14 (€12 outside exhibition periods)
Reduced rate: €10 (€8 outside exhibition periods)
Free admisssions (children under 12, unemployed) We booked a private tour of the Palais Garnier for the full Opera House experience. You can book yours here through the Paris Opera House official website."
4,"Year after year travellers make their way to Croatia for yacht sailings along the epic coastline. But chances are if you’ve been to Croatia you have probably overlooked Zagreb. Don’t worry, you’re not alone! Many travellers overlook the capital city of Croatia on their first visit. But if you have more time on your hands, there are more than enough reasons to visit. Zagreb is a compact city in relative terms but has a lot to offer visitors. From its distinguishable Austro-Hungarian architecture to the twin-spired Gothic Cathedral, Zagreb has a lot to be discovered. The city of Zagreb is best discovered on foot. There are winding roads and alleyways galore. Just walking around the city feels like an adventure in itself! The city of Zagreb is made up by a mash-up of architectural styles. From secessionist to neo-baroque and even a splash of art deco, you will notice many different styles. I couldn’t believe how multi-faceted this city was until I was standing in the heart of it! Museum of Broken Relationships – a quirky museum that dives into failed love affairs. Amusing and full of quirky stories with personal objects to match the anecdotes. St. Mark’s Church – If you are looking for the beautiful coloured church, this is it. This 13th-century church has an impressive tiled roof and is one of the best attractions to see. Gornji Grad–Medveščak – This word translates to “upper town”. It is the most scenic neighbourhood in Zagreb to discover on foot. Mesnica NENO – This is a fresh food market with local produce. The perfect stop if you’re filling up for a picnic lunch!  Follow along on Instagram to stay up to date with my travels!"
5,"My version of Paris is a romanticised one and that doesn’t come without reference to the lost generation (Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, et. al) and their time spent in Paris. The city of light was much different back in those days, but of course, much the same. Back then writers were cult celebrities much like actors and actresses and today, these writers are still so wildly celebrated and adored. Much of their works were created in Paris and much of their inspiration drawn from this city, so here is where you’ll find your own literary inspiration at the best bookstores in Paris!  I won’t start with the obvious choice for first mention, because I was so pleasantly surprised by this bookstore by the publishing house of the same name, that I wanted to make it my #1 recommendation in Paris. Assouline are renowned in the design world for creating beautiful, captivating coffee table books. The book store is nothing short of a work of art and there are a few around the city. 35 Rue Bonaparte, Saint Germain, Paris  An institution in its own right, Shakespeare & Co is hands down the most visited, famous, and talked about bookshop in Paris. The bookstore features in Hemmingway’s A Moveable Feast, arguably one of the best Parisian memoirs (or in my opinion, the very best!) 37 Rue de la Bûcherie, Paris  Beginning in 1989, the Abbey Bookshop in the Latin Quarter is another of Paris’ most beautiful bookstores in a classic, walk-through-time kinda way. This store is overloaded with all of the best reads, classics, rare finds, and you could easily spend an hour or two browsing through the seemingly endless shelves. 29 Rue de la Parcheminerie | Latin Quarter  Berkeley Books of Paris (Saint Germain) La Hune (Saint Germain) Librairie Galignani (224 rue de Rivoli)"
6," The iconic skyline of Paris would not be nearly as definitive without a view of the Eiffel tower and one of my favourite activities when visiting the city is to continue my never ending quest for the best view. Many will tell you the best view is to be had from Montparnasse (somewhat true), but if you ask me you can beat the secret street view from Avenue de Camoëns. Read more: The 20 most Instagrammable Places in Paris  Chances are you’ve heard of the world’s most recognisable museum and it’s most famous work, the Mona Lisa. But did you know the Louvre is also home to more than 35,000 pieces of work and 380,000 objects? Not to mention the building’s intricate interiors are a work of art in themselves.  With its gold trimmings and ornate details, the Pont Alexandre III is one of Paris’ most romantic places to watch the sun set or rise on the Seine river. As the sun sets and blue hour settles in, the warm lights turn this bridge in to what could pass as a movie set and indeed, has been the location for many films set in the city.  As the centre of Paris, Ile de Cite still feels like the beating heart of the city. The island is home to an oversupply of ice creameries and quaint cafes, making it the perfect area to explore on a hot summers day as you make the most of the shelter provided by the shadowed buildings and the narrow streets in which they reside.  Separating the Right bank from the Left bank, the Seine river will forever be one of the most beautiful places to watch the sun rise over the city of Paris. While many visitors to Paris make their way to the Seine for a Parisian picnic at sunset, you can enjoy much of the Seine all to yourself in the early hours of the morning before the city awakes.  Concept stores reached their prime in the early 2000’s and while many have since closed their doors, Merci is one of the few that have managed to last the distance. The store is filled with French designers and artisans’ work, with everything on offer from homewares to clothing and everything between.  Passing time is an art form in Paris and nowhere is that more idyllic than out the front of a typical Parisian cafe. While the famed households names such as Cafe de Flore and Les Deux Magots are filled with well-dressed out-of-towners, you can find the most unique and authentic experiences to be had in the Marais, Saint-Canal-Martin and on the corners of neighbourhoods away from the city’s monuments and museums.  Sure, you’ve heard the debate before as to who possesses the best macarons in Paris and more likely than not you’ve had a variety of answers (let’s cut to the chase: Pierre Herme can’t be beat for technique and intense flavours). However the original macaron merchant, Laduree, is a Parisian institution in itself and should be visited at least once on your Parisian adventures (just be sure to skip the Champs Elysees location). Read more: In Search of the Best Macarons In Paris  As the most iconic church in all of Paris, Notre Dame Cathedral is a must see both inside and out. If you’re fit and able, the best view of the cathedral is to be had by climbing the tower stairs, seeing Paris from the same view as the gargoyles that eerily sit atop the towers overlooking the city.  This English bookstore has become one of the most popular pitstops for travellers to Paris – thanks in part to its’ famous inhabitants (the likes of Hemingway and Fitzgerald would visit on the regular during their years in Paris). Read more: Where to find the Best Bookstores in Paris  There are many ways to get around the city of Paris – by bicycle, metro, and by foot are the most popular. Walking the city streets is one of the best ways to see the city and you will often find the journey between destinations is more worth than the destination itself! Some of the best neighbourhoods to wander around include Canal-Saint-Martin (less gentrified), Le Marais (bustling on a Sunday) and Montmartre (the artist’s quarter). Read more: Where to Spend a Sunday in Paris  Unbutton the pants! Paris is a mecca for pastry lovers and indeed, what most would consider the beating heart of French pastry culture. While you’re in town be sure to follow our guide to the best pastry shops in Paris – where you’ll find the best macarons, eclairs, croissants, tarts and more. Read more: The Top 12 Pastry Shops in Paris  A few years in a row I have made it my duty to attend a new pastry class in Paris and this year was the cherry on the cake: learning to make a chocolate gateau cake in the basement of the Ritz, Paris. These classes are much more expensive and difficult to come by than other classes in Paris (where I learned to make macarons and breakfast pastries), however the skills learned in the four hour class were invaluable. Most of the classes are offered in French but don’t let that scare you – there is an English translator assistant chef on hand to help you through the class. Read more: Learning French Pastry at the Ritz Escoffier  If you plan to visit Paris over the warmer months you absolutely cannot miss the opportunity to park up at the Eiffel Tower on a patch of grass and spoil yourself in some local produce. Each year when I visit in spring I do just that – traipsing around the city collecting local wines, cheeses, chocolates and of course, macarons!  Situated between the Louvre and the Place de la Concorde are some of the most understated gardens in Paris, yet arguably one of the most beautiful. While many visitors to Paris walk through the gardens on the popular route between the Louvre, Place de la Concorde and eventually the Eiffel Tower, many do not make time to stop and spend some time in the gardens themselves. In the Spring and Summer you will find ice cream stalls, a small Paul pastry stand and artists painting their inspiring surrounds.  If you’ve checked off the tourist monuments and attractions or simply looking for something a little off the beaten path, check out some of Paris’ hidden passages – an opulent look inside the history of the city. There are a number of passages dotted around the city, with our favourite pick being Galerie Vivienne. Read more: A complete guide to the secret passages of Paris  A less gentrified neighbourhood where you can feel a sense of “old Paris” is in Canal-Saint-Martin. This area is full of great boulangeries and small cafes and you can for the most part avoid international chains. Be sure to stop by Du Pain et Idees (Bread and Ideas) for perhaps the best pastries in all of Paris. Read more: Where to Spend a Sunday in Paris  Paris is a mecca for cute little cafes, especially if you go beyond the main streets and explore the hidden alleyways. Pictured is Au Vieux Paris, adorned with wildly growing wisteria in the warmer months. Read more: 30 Beautiful Hidden Locations in Paris  To go or not to go? Paris’ most iconic cabaret show, the Moulin Rouge, has been running since 1889 and still to this day attracts a packed house at multiple shows daily. The show is a classic look inside French cabaret shows and if you can stand the tightly packed audience space, is a classic show to see. Alternatives include the Crazy Horse Paris and Lido on the Champs Elysees. Read more: Old Paris today: Where to find the best of old Paris  If you find yourself in Paris during the spring/summer, there’s no way you can miss out on a visit to Berthillon, home to the best ice creams and sorbets in Paris. This luxury glacier has built a name for itself in Paris, with a number of locations offering Berthillon throughout Paris. For the best selection head to the flagship location at 29-31 Rue Saint-Louis en l’Île. Read more: The Ultimate Sweets Tour of Paris  The sugary almond cookies known as macarons have taken the world by storm in the past decade but have been popular in France since the 19th century. If you don’t want to spend up to $4 per little cookie, book in a macaron making class and learn to make these popular pastries at home. La Cuisine offer a great introductory course as well as a macaron masterclass, where you will learn both the French and Italian methods to making macarons with a qualified French pastry chef. Read more: French Pastry Class in Paris: Learning to Make Macarons  While there are many locations throughout Paris to enjoy views of the Eiffel Tower, arguably the best kept secret location is at the end of Avenue de Camoëns. This is a beautiful part of town with some of the most expensive real estate in Paris, so it is also a great chance to explore the neighbourhood. Read more: The World of Wanderlust Complete Guide to Paris  Another great view of the Eiffel Tower is to be had atop the Arc de Triomphe – if you can survive the 284 steps to the top! Read more: My Paris Photo Diary  Popular in the late 19th-century to the early 20th-century, Art Nouveau architectural influence has a small but delightful presence in Paris, with some of the most beautiful facades hidden throughout the city. Read more: A Guide to Art Nouveau in Paris  This monumental fountain in the Luxembourg Gardens is one of the prettiest places in the city, especially during the Spring and Summer time. It can be found on the East side of the Luxembourg Palace in a tree-lined, shady area of the park.  After walking, cycling a bike around the city is another great way to see the city at great length and with the velib system located throughout the city, it is not only an efficient but also affordable way to see the city sights.  Located in the courtyard of the Palais Royal, Les Deux Plateaux is an art installation better known as the black and white striped columns. The courtyard itself is a beautiful sight to see, but the modern art installation makes it extra special and worthy of a visit.  Thick, rich and deliciously indulgent, the hot chocolate (chocolat chaud) at Angelina Paris is an experience in itself. Served in a silver jug that allows you to pour your calories out in front of you, the rich chocolate is best accompanied with a dollop of cream to sweeten to your liking. Read more: A Look Inside Angelina Paris  Just half an hour by train from the centre of Paris one can reach the Palace of Versailles, the official royal residence up until the French Revolution in 1789. Read more: Palace of Versailles Day Trip  Paris is the ideal city to sit back and people watch, so pull up a chair outside one of the (never ending supply of) cafes and let the world pass you by. Saint-Germain-des-Pres is a great place to start, as well as the perimeter of the Place des Vosges in Le Marais on a Sunday afternoon.  That magical time also known as blue hour, dusk is the perfect setting to see the artistic neighbourhood of Montmartre come to life. Just be aware that areas of Montmartre can become pretty sketchy of the evening, so that magical hour doesn’t last long!  In the warmer months when the courtyards and gardens of Paris spring back to life from the cold winters, there’s a certain sense of renewal throughout the city and nowhere is that more beautiful than inside the courtyard at the Plaza Athénée. This luxury hotel costs a pretty penny to stay the night, but you can experience all the glamour of the hotel by enjoying a luxurious afternoon tea setting in the courtyard.  As a predominantly solo traveller (save for a few friends and family members who join from time to time) I often find myself wandering aimlessly around the streets of a city but in Paris I always have a purpose: to find the best views of the Eiffel Tower! Some of my favourite moments have been stumbling upon a cafe with a view directly of the monument or a small street to enjoy all by myself – the list is endless! I won’t list my favourite finds here because the hunt is half the fun!  These traditional open-air Seine-side booksellers and art print sellers have been a staple in the landscape of Paris since the 16th century when literacy gained popularity during the Renaissance and these so-called “vagabonds” set up shop on the Seine. To this day this is one of the most popular spots in Paris to score a bargain on a second hand book.  One of my all time favourite Paris books, The Only Street in Paris, made me not only realise but understand my love for this neighbourhood in greater depth. Montmartre and in particular Rue des Martyrs is an insight into the real Paris: a mixing pot of artisans, ethnicities, cultures and traditions. This side of Paris is still very much alive today, though beyond Montmartre has moved further outwards to the outskirts of Paris.  Chances are you’ve seen the photos – but the truth is this optical illusion is a house that is not quite sinking, but a great photo opportunity nonetheless. Located at Rue Margaux, the “sinking house” is located right by Sacré-Cœur on the right (if you’re looking at it).  Whilst in the neighbourhood, be sure to make your way to the famous Sacré–Cœur Basilica and make your way around the hilltop overlooking the city to take in the sweeping views of the city.  Whether you’re seeing a ballet, opera, or simply taking a tour of the impeccable interiors, you must absolutely take in the Paris Opera House at some point during your visits to Paris.  As one of Paris’ most renowned cafes (alongside its’ neighbour Les Deux Margots), Cafe de Flore is an experience in itself, as well as a people-watching mecca worth waiting for a table for!  If you’re in Paris on a budget then look no further than the Latin Quarter, a maze of cheap street eats at your disposal. From crepes to kebabs and everything in between, there are endless food options on offer all for the bargain price of a few euros.  Looking for a vintage Chanel blazer or a pair of clip-on earrings from the 1950’s? Saint Germain is where to go! This neighbourhood is full of boutiques selling all kinds of vintage goodies, especially if you’re looking for labels.  One of my all time favourite places to perch myself on a weekend (especially if the sun is out) is Place des Vosges, arguably the prettiest public square in all of Paris. Grab yourself some baked goodies from one of the patisseries surrounding the square (my favourite is Carette) and let time pass you by as you soak in the opulent surrounds.  Chances are you’ve seen it, plan to visit it, but did you know you can also go inside? This Basilica is one of Paris’ most visited monuments but more often than not visitors stay on the outside, getting so caught up in the view of the city that they forget to go inside!  If you’re anything like me the only diet you’ll be on in Paris is precisely no diet at all, so make your way to Angelina and stock up on some goodies.  One of my favourite and often under-appreciated features of Paris is the attention to detail taken in the staircases of beautiful apartment blocks and Paris’ most luxurious hotels. The above pictured staircase is located inside Plaza Athénée, one of the most iconic hotels in the city.  If you’re after a gift for that hard-to-buy-for person or in search of the perfect coffee table book, then look no further than Assouline in Saint Germain des Pres.  Built in the early 13th Century, Sainte-Chapelle chapel is home to one of the most gorgeous displays of stained glass you will find the world over.  On weekends especially, the neighbourhood of Montmartre comes to life and nowhere is that more true than the artist’s district. This neighbourhood is of course an artist’s district in itself, having long been the home of bohemians in the city of Paris. Nowadays you can wander around at leisure, taking in the sights and sounds of one of Paris’ most authentic, old-world-charm neighbourhoods.  While it only lasts a couple of weeks every April, there is no better way to see Paris than in a blanket of pink cherry blossoms wistfully blowing in the light breeze of Spring. Read more: Where to Find the best Cherry Blossoms in Paris  As my all-time favourite cafe in Paris (chances are if you’ve heard of it before elsewhere on World of Wanderlust), I cannot finish this article without recommending Carette. There are two locations in the city (one in Trocadero and one in Le Marais), with my favourite being the latter. Over to you! What are your favourite things to do in Paris!?"
7,"Staying at Ashford Castle in Ireland has been on my travel bucket list for a few years now. I can safely say it did not disappoint. Ashford Castle is indeed the most memorable castle I have stayed at and it is of course the only one. Here’s a complete run down of what to expect when you check in to the gorgeous Ashford Castle in Ireland. I first visited Ashford Castle about five years ago when I was travelling through the countryside. I visited as a day guest and paid the fee to wander the castle grounds. The castle itself it reserved only for paying hotel guests, so I promised myself i would return one day. The castle was finished in the 13th-century and is everything you imagined a castle would be inside. As if I had reversed my age ten years, I was energetically prancing around the corridors. I soon discovered secret rooms, private corridors and a cinema room complete with its own popcorn machine. We’ll start with the Prince of Wales Bar because it was my favourite place to cozy up in the evening. Every night myself and my friend would finish here with a glass of merlot. The entire property has been refurbished recently and the results are incredible. Each of the dining venues have a very unique appeal. The Bar and the American style diner underneath the castle named Stanley’s were my favourite choices. If you can pull yourself away from the castle for a few hours a day, the castle ground are well and truly worth exploring also. The manicured gardens seem to go for miles and if you have time (and a bottomless budget) there are plenty of activities on offer on the Estate. These range from lake activities to Land Rover excursions into the Irish countryside. But my favourite activity at Ashford was the morning dog walk with the hotel’s two Irish hounds – what a treat! Wandering around the castle was often a discovery, especially with the countless times I got lost in the various wings and floors of the property. There is much to discover from an open library, home cinema, Moroccan spa and secret toffee jars. Oh what a discovery that one was! One of the highlights of my stay was paying a visit to the Moroccan Hammam and impressive mosaic tiled spa in the basement of the castle. It was a cold and rainy day so I made some time for myself and visited the spa. Had I not visited I would have been so disappointed with myself as this was another favourite part of my stay. Be sure to visit the Moroccan steam room and cold wash yourself before retiring to the pool for a relaxing afternoon (consider these instructions to follow rather than a suggestion!) Perhaps my favourite discovery of all was entirely by mistake. Exploring the castle late one night, I came across the word “CINEMA” on a door in the new wing of the castle. Cautiously pushing the door forward, I soon realised that yes, Ashford has its very own private cinema (of course!) Each day there is a new rotation of films, including old classics and nostalgic hits such as the Princess Diaries. Oh, did I mention a popcorn machine, pick-and-mix and butler service for drinks!? Ashford Castle has so much character and charm that I could not tell you in one short blog post just how much I enjoyed my time here. All 83 rooms in the castle are unique and styled in their own way so be sure to do your research to decide the best room for you. Prices start at $1600 per room per night. Because of the remote location of the castle, you will likely stay on property for meals and activities. I can highly recommend the casual dining restaurant (Cullen’s at the Cottage) and the very quaint Prince of Wales Bar for a glass of wine by the fire in the evenings. A very warm thank you to Ashford Castle for welcoming me to stay at the castle during my time in Ireland. All opinions and photos are my own!"
8,"isitIts no secret I am head over heels in love with Switzerland. The rolling hills, the impressive scenic railways, the delicious pastries and the difficult to beat ski destinations… Switzerland is a winter playground but also has so much to offer year-round when visiting the beautiful cities and towns dotted throughout the landlocked country. As this is my fourth visit to Switzerland and I have now seen more of the country than I could have ever imagined a few years ago on my first visit, I feel it is my duty to share my findings to help you plan your Swiss adventure and be sure to get the most out of your trip!  The Swiss capital is quite literally as pretty as a postcard when viewed from above and the heart of the Old Town never fails to impress travellers in search of that quintessential Swiss experience. You can expect a great range of restaurants here in Bern but my favourite culinary feature is the endless supply of choices in terms of patisseries, here known as a condettorei. The swiss hot chocolate is a perfect way to warm up in the cooler months, whilst in the summer Bern features some great ice creameries if you just ask a local which direction to head in.  As my personal favourite, Zürich is a pastel-coloured dream that is not only on par with, but if you ask me, is prettier than a postcard. The winding alleyways of the Old Town, the charming little shop fronts, the smell of a nearby kondetorei and the beauty of the flowing Limatt river through the centre of town are all reason enough to visit this gorgeous Swiss city; the biggest in Switzerland with a population of 380,000.  Characterised by its lake and iconic snow-capped mountains as a backdrop, Lucerne is far and beyond one of the most picturesque cities in Switzerland. The city is compact in size and has one of the friendliest vibes out of all the picks, making it a great pit stop for a day or two to appreciate Swiss hospitality.  Located on Lake Geneva and just a short train ride from the city with the same name, Lausanne has a more medieval feel than anywhere else on the list and warrants it as another Swiss beauty to visit on your travels. Even if visiting for just a day between cities or as a day trip from Geneva, Lausanne is sure to please the eye!  As the most famous ski resort in Switzerland and one of the most renowned in all of Europe, Zermatt is as classic and clichè as they come. The small town is covered in a thick blanket of snow throughout the winter, though what makes Zermatt so popular is the availability to ski year-round, given its remote location high in the Alps and the assistance of man-made snow machines. Be sure to avoid peak season if possible as prices are sky high and availability low, particularly throughout Christmas and New Years celebrations.  Another great ski destination that also comes to life in the summer is Arosa; a short train journey from Chur. This small village has a lot to offer by way of winter activities, however, if you decide to visit outside of the ski season you will still find beauty in the rolling hills, lush greenery, and ample opportunities to kick back and unwind in one of the many alpine spas. My favourites include the Tschuggen Hotel (with the best alpine spa in town and the best restaurant at La Vetta) and Arosa Kulm, a more low key choice and also a nice alpine spa.  I first visited Saint Moritz in the summer a few years ago and instantly fell in love with the gorgeous mountain scenery, lakeviews from my balcony, friendly locals and range of hiking available in the immediate area and further into the Engadine.  Located in the South of Switzerland near the Italian border is Lugano, a gorgeous little city on the lake that near enough feels as if you have crossed into Italy, with Italian being the recognised language of the region. Situated on Lake Lugano, this city is incredibly picturesque and a great stopover if travelling between Switzerland and Italy or vice versa.  Located on the Rhine River, Basel is a gorgeous insight into another of Switzerland’s neighbours: Germany. The city also borders France and thus has a unique mix of architectures, making it one of the most unique cities to visit in Switzerland and certainly one of the most intriguing. Plus yes, it is gorgeous!  Located in French-speaking Switzerland is Geneva, a city that reveals its charm upon further look (typically recognised as an international business city). Although not as picturesque as many of the other locations on this list, Geneva offers a great location to stop over between Italy and France, allowing for a short visit to Switzerland. Otherwise, if you have more time to uncover Geneva’s hidden beauty, you will find it lying in the backstreets of the old town! Follow us on Instagram for more travel inspiration!"
9,"And here we are again – with another French town taking my breath away. After claiming that Annecy would have to be the prettiest town in France, I’m back with a new claim: perhaps that title belongs to both Annecy and Colmar… or perhaps even more correctly, France is full of cute towns to explore! Regardless, I cannot choose. Both of these towns are an absolute delight to explore, so if you find yourself in the North-East Alsace region of France, here is why you absolutely must visit Colmar!  For our stay in Colmar our only interest was being centrally located so that we could make the most of our short two day visit. After doing a little research online I found “Le Columbier” Apartments & Hotel who were highly rated based on reviews, so it seemed the obvious choice given their location right by the water and just a short few minutes walk to all the shops and centre of town. The 4* hotel turned out to be perfect for our stay, offering a light buffet breakfast in the mornings to get us started for the day. After such a good experience at the hotel and with rooms extremely generous in size, I would definitely recommend this hotel to travellers on a mid-range budget in Colmar.  As Colmar was the last town to be freed after the Second World War, the German influence is very noticeable in most of the buildings in the older part of town, with many of them incredibly well preserved and painted in bright colours. The entire Alsace region changed nationalities between French and German throughout the course of history, so the unique blend of architecture is the biggest drawcard for many visitors coming to see this colourful, idyllic town. Be sure to wander the streets and make the small canals a focal point, as this is without a doubt the most picturesque part of town. There are also many great alleyways and narrow streets to meander, filled with local souvenirs, pastries, and antiques.  Without a doubt the canal boat trip (in “Little Venice”) is one of the most iconic things to do in Colmar. The short boat trip is a great way to see the city from the water and is really popular during summer, so better to do it early in the day. Another great activity if you have more than one day in Colmar is to rent a bicycle and ride part of the Alsation wine route. We did this by renting a bicycle from Lulu’s bike rental for just 6 euros for half a day (10 euros for a full day) and it was a great way to see the countryside, as well as another beautiful village nearby name Egusheim.  As we visited in the off season (April) and it was impossibly cold outdoors, much of our time was spent indoors enjoying the local cuisine. Colmar has some great eateries and an abundance of Michelin Star restaurants, so be sure to pick out your preference and book in advance in order to secure a table. Gilg – For the best pastries in town (particularly the macarons), every local will tell you to go straight to Gilg. The prices are really fair and the food is delicious – I really couldn’t fault it! Poulaillon – Another patisserie we frequented for quick lunch bites was Poulaillon. The sweets weren’t anything fantastic but the basic pastries were delicious and cheap! Alsako – On a rainy Monday night when nothing seemed to be open at 7:00pm, we found this unassuming restaurant opposite the supermarket and decided to give it a go as our last option. I ordered the champignon quinoa dish and it was to die for! The prices are very reasonable (8 euros for my main course) and the food was delicious. A great cheap eats option. L’atelier du peintre – If you’re looking for a special meal you will be delighted to learn that Colmar is full of Michelin star restaurants. We did our research to find a Michelin starred restaurant that catered to vegetarians and had a fantastic meal at L’atelier du peintre – totally worth the price tag! The meal cost us around $150 for two mains, two desserts and one drink. Colmar is full of Michelin dining experiences – see here to check out this full list. "
10,"Milan for an outsider can be seen as an obscurity in Italy. The city has reinvented itself over the decades since it was partly destroyed by the Second World War bomb raids and thus while it might appear “newer” to the untrained eye, Milan still has an impressive history that makes it feel so cultural and alive in the present day. The city is as charming and impressive as you make it, so to make the most of your trip here is a quick guide to Milan! One thing is for sure in Milan: everything is fashionable. Even the hotels. Fashion houses have been opening their own hotels in Milan for years now and Armani Hotel Milano is one of the most recognisable of these. The building appears simple and uncomplicated from the outside, but once inside your room it is a complete change of scene. Sure, the interior decor is minimalist, chic and characteristically dark (James Bond must have surely been an inspiration), but the simplicity of the room stops there. Each room is equipped with its own iPad controller, which essentially controls your entire room from the front door unlocking to the curtains closing… even ordering popcorn and ice cream to eat with your movie, all with the touch of a button! The hotel is fairly centrally located at the end of popular high end shopping street Via Monte Napoleone (across the street at the T junction on Via Alessandro Manzoni) and is just a short 5-10 minute walk away from the Milano Duomo and many more shopping streets.  If its your first time in Milano you can’t miss the top spots listed below, but be sure to allow time to wander, eat, shop and take in the atmosphere as that is what a visit to Milano is all about! No visit to Milan would be complete without seeing the Milan Cathedral in all of its gothic architectural glory. You can view it from the Piazza or pay a fee to enter. You can even walk around the top if you can withstand the queues! Located inside an ornate 19th Century arcade are a range of high end boutiques and fancy cafes, inside the location known as none other than Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The interior is incredibly speccy, but be sure to look both up and down to get a full appreciation of the intricacies.  Even if you don’t like the opera, a visit to Teatro alla Scala is a great night out to get a feel for traditional entertainment & culture. This is one of Europe’s most impressive opera houses inside so be sure to take a good look around before and afterwards! A UNESCO World Heritage listed site, Santa Maria delle Grazie is where you can come to see Leonardo da Vinci’s famous The Last Supper mural on display.   When in Italy, you eat. And you eat a lot. Milan is renowned for its’ Risotto alla Milanese: risotto, saffron, grated cheese, butter, white wine and chicken stock. In town you will also find some great patisseries to grab a quick bite & espresso on the run. If you’re a fan of pastries I would highly recommend a visit to Paticceria Marchesi, one of the best patisseries in town. If you’re after a healthier option, head over to Mantra raw vegan where you can take a day off the heavy pasta dishes and enjoy fresh, healthy cuisine. Entree is a great option if you want authentic Italian cuisine without the hefty price tag. Ristorante Cracco is a more expensive option but worth the extra euros, believe me!  Venice Lake Como Amalfi Coast Cinque Terre Rome Florence  We flew to Europe with Emirates via Dubai. Emirates flies daily to Milan as well as a range of other major European cities. Thanks to Armani Hotel for welcoming World of Wanderlust as a guest of the hotel."
11,"Located in the Northern lakes district of Italy is the crowning jewel of the region: Lago di Como (Italian) or simply, Lake Como. For centuries this lake has attracted an elite crowd of villa owners, from famous celebrities through to successful businessmen and women from around the globe. However, you needn’t have a handful of zeros displaying on your bank account statement to visit, as Lake Como is home to an impressive array of accommodation offerings: from luxurious villa resorts through to humble apartment rentals, all allowing visitors to experience the magic of Lake Como, if only for a few nights.  Located just below the Southern border of Switzerland, Lake Como is almost as North as one can go in Italy: the land of pizza, pasta, gelato and welcoming locals. Although I have visited Italy a handful of times, I have never quite made it to Lake Como but the destination has been on my radar for some time. And now that I’ve been? I know what I was missing out on! The lake is impressive in size, though this does mean you’ll need more than a few nights to see it all. However if time is not on your side you can entirely manage to have the full experience over a 3-4 night stay, allowing enough time to see the highlights and leave you wanting more (which just means a return trip in the future!) As we only had a few nights to stay in Lako Como and explore the surrounding towns, villages and attractions, below is a complete “quick” guide to Como, focusing only one the must do and see experiences: no more, no less!   If we’re speaking of the lake as a whole, then it should be noted that Lake Como is huge in size and thus takes some time and effort to travel around from point to point. The town, Como, is where you will find many shops, restaurants and a great local vibe, though it is away from here where you will have the best experiences of the lake by staying in a lakeside villa, still only a bus or ferry ride away from the main town and nearby attractions. For our stay in Lake Como we checked in to CastaDiva Resort, one of the area’s leading luxury hotels, housed in a 18th Century Villa that was once the residence of opera singer Giuditta Pasta. The resort was small in size, allowing for an authentic experience whereby staff would remember our names and greet us every morning as we wandered through the lush green gardens on our way to breakfast. Highlights included a complimentary shuttle service in and out of Como, a gorgeous floating pool on the lake (sadly not in use for our stay at the beginning of Spring), an impressive sauna/steam/spa area and lush gardens to wander around and experience life on the lake.  Although the lake is huge and the villages to explore are plentiful, getting around the area is made extremely easy thanks to an extensive ferry service (fast & slow services) and public buses. If you are staying in Como and wish to explore some of the small lakeside villages and towns, then head down to the ferry pier and take one of the public ferries to where you want to go. I would highly recommend paying a little extra for the fast service one way (if travelling to the most popular town of the region – Bellagio) and taking the slow ferry the other way in order to get a glimpse of the many towns along the lake as you stop in at each one. The fast ferry service takes approximately 45-60 minutes whilst the slow ferry will take around 2 hours.  The city of Como is at the base of the lake (which appears as an upside down “Y” letter) and the heart of the region. It is here where you will find the best atmosphere, ample eateries serving classic Italian meals, shops, boutiques, and a network of ferries heading upstream to explore the smaller villages and lakeside towns. Below are my few recommendations from our couple of days spent in Como for afternoon strolls and early dinners before retiring back to our villa a short way up the lake. Naturally I tried a lot of gelato in the few days we were in Como because incase you haven’t noticed (in which case I’d say you are new here), I’m a self-confessed ice cream addict. Name a flavour and I’ve tried it. Name the world’s best ice cream parlours and gelaterias – I promise you I’ve been there. My favourite gelato in Como is located just off the main square, right by the waterfront in a small and unassuming little building: Gelateria Lariana. My favourite flavours were Bachi (chocolate hazelnut) and Dark Chocolate (seriously so good that my eyes popped out of my head for the first taste). If you’re looking for a nice little restaurant – not too fancy but great for date night – then I can recommend this great little find on Piazza Domenico Croggi. The menu is typically Italian but with a healthy spin – loads of salads to choose from and great vegetarian options! As one of the key landmarks of the city, a visit to Como would not be complete without at least setting your eyes on the impressive facade of the Como Cathedral. If you’re looking to see the lake from a different viewpoint then you will find a great viewing platform by taking the 5-7 minute journey on the funicolare, to the sweeping views of the lake and surrounds below.  Located a short 9-15 minute ferry ride from Bellagio is the famous Villa Carlotta, the most visited villa on the lake that is open to the public as a museum. The villa also has extensive gardens that will keep you busy walking around for at least an hour, so be sure to allow a minimum time of 90 minutes here to explore the Villa and gardens, as well as grab a milkshake or ice cream before you depart (the chocolate milkshakes are personally tried and tested and believe me when I say scrumptious!)  By far the most picturesque town on the lake and certainly the most visited is Bellagio; located at the fork of the “Y” shape of the lake and within short distance to many of Lake Como’s other popular sites and attractions. Our preferred lunch spot in Bellagio was La Fontana for their great pizzas and cute little outdoor setting. This restaurant is far enough away from the hustle and bustle that you get a very authentic experience and the pizza margarita is delicious! There is a 2.50 euro cover charge per person but the prices are very reasonable. If you’re travelling with a food intolerance or with someone who has one, then head straight for Far Out restaurant, only a short walk from where you depart the ferry. This restaurant caters to vegetarians, vegans and gluten intolerances with ease. There is no cover charge and the prices are moderate.  Villa Balbianello – Built in 1787 with beautiful terrace gardens and an in-house museum. Villa Melzi d’Eril – Located in Bellagio, built in neo-classical style and with a stunning garden to explore. Ciresa Plain on Mt. Barro – For enthusiastic day hikers you can get a stunning view of the lake from high above at the Ciresa Plain lookout on Mt. Barro.

12,"So you want to see, do and experience ALL that this incredible city, Budapest, has to offer? We’ve created the ultimate Budapest Bucket List with 23 of the best things to do in Budapest – including what to eat, where to drink, what to see, and how to make the most out of your trip to Budapest.  Budapest is renowned for its hot thermal baths, many of which are open to the public and some of which are even outside! My favourite public bath is Szechenyi, followed by Rudas and Gellert (all are worth a visit). My absolute favourite place in Budapest is to take in the sweeping views of the city from Fisherman’s Bastion in Buda, overlooking the Danube River and Pest in the distance. This is also a fabulous place to see the sun setting. Perhaps the most popular local dish you could try in Budapest is the traditional Hungarian Goulash. Of course, this is a meaty broth, so vegetarians and vegans might prefer to make their way to Edeni cafe in Buda, a fully vegan cafe with a delicious lunch menu. Be sure to grab some sweet snacks to take away as well as it is incredibly well priced!  Separating the two sides of Budapest (known as “Buda” and “Pest) is the gorgeous Danube river, with a series of bridges connecting the two. The most fabulous of these bridges is without a doubt the Chain Bridge, which offers a fabulous walk from one side to the other. The lions guarding the bridge are a perfect photo opportunity and you can see many landmarks from here, including Buda Castle and the Hungarian Parliament. Whilst on the “Buda” side of town, be sure to wander down to view the Hungarian Parliament (a great walking route begins crossing Chain Bridge, catching the funicular to Buda Castle, walking onwards to Fisherman’s Bastion and downhill to arrive exactly opposite the Hungarian Parliament on the Buda side of the river). When you think of Budapest you might not instantly think of shopping, but with a much more favourable exchange rate to the Euro it is entirely worth while (Hungary remains on the forint at present). Andrassy St is the place to go and you’ll find all the known designers as well as some great local designers on this street and surrounding streets in Pest. Although a little touristy, this is a great way to make your way smoothly up to Buda Castle from down below. Alternatively, take the stairs. As with most European opera houses, the stunning interior of the Hungarian State Opera House is enough to write a book on. Even if you don’t go see a show, be sure to book a tour to go inside. Although not a Palace in the present day (currently a Four Seasons Hotel), Gresham Palace is a stunning display of aristocracy in Hungary over the centuries. Even if you just wander in to the lobby to take a look around, it is well worth a visit! This fascinating installation of art is a way of remembering the thousands of lives that were lost through nazi occupation. Be sure to head down for a look – it is quite touching. If you find yourself wandering around for hours to find a good bar to position yourself in for the evening, you’ll be wandering for quite a while. All the good bars are hidden ruin bars, many of which lie underground. With many of them closing down and popping up every so often, it is best to ask a local for the best current recommendations. Just be prepared for one crazy night out! This is one roof worth walking out of your way for. Trust me when I say you will never see a roof more intricate and fascinating in your lifetime – google it for evidence. If you’re on a larger Europe itinerary you might be churched-out already, but I promise this one is worth it! St. Stephen’s is gorgeous both inside and out and is very centrally located.  If you’re looking to splurge on a romantic night out, this is it. Book a dinner cruise at night to enjoy the Danube. Again, if you’re not churched-out enough already, this is another one worth a look. If you’re a wine lover, you’ll absolutely love this wine-tasting experience underground. If you’re up for a walk, head all the way along Andrassy Street to Heroe’s Square and spin 360 to take it all in. The walk itself is worth while! One of the best museums I have visited in Europe was the Terror House in Budapest. I won’t say any more other than to just go – it is a great insight into modern history to place Hungary’s position in the 20th Century.  If you haven’t quite hit the spot yet with all your thermal spa-ing, head into one of the (many) fancy hotels for a little over indulgence by way of a spa treatment. My favourite included mineral mud at the Four Seasons Gresham Palace. This is perhaps the most scenic way to get around Budapest for those who are visiting the top attractions and don’t wish to walk all the way.  If you’re visiting Budapest in the warmer months there’s nowhere else you’d rather be than on Margaret Island – a local’s favourite. The island turns into a full time entertainment destination with many pop up bars and restaurants. As the largest synagogue in Europe and one of the largest in the world, it is certainly worth a visit to step inside this incredible display of architecture. Located in the city park of Budapest is a castle – can you hardly believe it!? Having normally travelled a long distance outside of capital cities to reach notable castles I was delighted to see that the Vajdahunyad Castle was located in the city itself, just a short walk away.  Follow me on Instagram for more adventures!"
13,"The only thing more impressive than the scale and grandiose of the Hermitage Museum is the collection of artworks in which it possesses. With more than 3 million artworks, the Hermitage houses one of the most expansive art collections in the world. And if you ask anyone who has been, at the very least rivals the experience of The Louvre! Below is a brief guide to the Hermitage Museum to help you make the most of your visit. Highlights at the Hermitage are far and wide, from Picasso’s great Blue Period paintings to Michelangelo’s unfinished sculpture of a crouching boy. The museum is also home to a number of works by Monet, Cézanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Bonnard and Matise. Of all the world’s major museums, the Hermitage is perhaps the most confusing to navigate. There are no less than 400 rooms with interlinked buildings and hallways that span a total of three floors. Sound overwhelming? Wait til you’re inside! The easiest way to see the collection without skipping a beat is to take it floor by floor. Generally speaking this will lead you to antiques on the ground floor and European paintings on the first and second. Because there’s a strong chance you will get lost, be sure to arrive early and allow for at least half the day to explore the collection (you could easily spend an entire day here!) While it is more expensive to buy a ticket in advance, it will allow you to bypass the line for buying tickets. You will still need to join the queue to enter, but buying a ticket on the museum website prior to arrival can significantly reduce your wait time to get inside. The museum opens late (until 9pm) on Wednesdays, making this a great opportunity to avoid crowds and see more of the spaces at ease. Two day tickets will allow you to break up your visit over two days which is much better given the expansiveness of the collection. Check out the website (hermitagemuseum.org) prior to your arrival for a virtual tour of some of the most popular rooms."
14,"There are few places in Europe as dreamy as Bruges in northern Flanders. If you are a tourist visiting the city, you will notice it feels more like a small town as you explore the endless back streets. The charm of Bruges is unbelievable. And if you are looking for the best photo spots in Bruges, here is where you will find them. We’ll begin the list with Bruges’ most photographed square but more specifically, the belfry that towers above it. The Belfry of Bruges stands at a whopping 83 meters tall and if you’re up for it, offers one of the best views over Bruges. Of all the places in Bruges, the Minnewater (known in English as the Lake of Love) is the most romantic. This might seem like a hard pill to swallow as the whole old town feels incredibly romantic, however once you arrive at the Lake of Love you will see why. If you are visiting in the warmer months be sure to rent a boat and see the city from the waterways. Read more: Your guide to visiting Bruges in winter This charming early-20th-century pedestrian bridge is easily one of the best photo spots in Bruges if you dare to seek it out. The Bonifacius Bridge offers romantic views of the canal & town. It is quiet earlier and later in the day which is a much better time to visit the peaceful spot. Back in the main square, any visitor to Bruges will not be able to contain their excitement when viewing the Grote Markt, Bruges’ main square. This square is where you will find the beautiful facades commonly dubbed “lego houses” and is also the most central point to explore the city from. Be sure to pop into Godiva for a hot chocolate if you are visiting in the winter! Read more: A complete guide to Bruges The beguinage in Bruges dates back to the 13th century and is considered one of the best preserved in Europe. The tranquil convent garden is one of the most beautifully serene areas in the city and even manages to be bypassed by visiting tourists a lot of the time. Visit this location if you’re looking to avoid the crowds. The Quay of the Rosary is one of the most photographed spots in Bruges but it really isn’t hard to see why. The Rozenhoedkaai is as close to a postcard worthy photograph you will find here in Bruges. If you like the idea of stepping into a medieval fairytale, be sure to add this to your itinerary."
15,"The Austrian capital is imposing yet impressive, striking yet soft and most importantly full of fun things to see and do. To save you the trouble of knowing how to pick what to do (and what not to do), here’s a complete Vienna bucket list for the top twenty things to do in Vienna!  Here – let us save you the time. This is a complete guide to the Vienna coffee houses – an institution that was created right her in Vienna. Yup, not invented by Starbucks. Who doesn’t love a strudel? The Austrians invented it and the capital seems like the only viable option for where to enjoy it in all of its’ authentic, gooey, tasty deliciousness.  Whether ballet or opera, be sure to stop by at one of Europe’s most impressive theatres. If you don’t have a ticket, try the last minute ticket office at the side entrance and grab a “standing only” ticket for a few euros. If you’re looking for somewhere to just wander through to the sound of your headphones, then go straight to the museumsquartier neighbourhood. You will find yourself surrounded by impressive buildings, parks, and an array of choices for what to do next. Even if you come just to see Gustav Klimt’s “The Kiss”, you’d be doing yourself a favour. If you enjoy walking through history in the form of art, the Belvedere is a great museum to experience.  If you visit in winter, go straight for the rich, chocolatey hot chocolate (that also comes with a generous serving of whipped cream to sweeten and soften. But if you’ve visiting at any other time, go straight for the pastry cabinet. You will be sure to find something to hypnotise you inside. If you’re up for a palace of grand proportions, then Schönbrunn is exactly where you should head next. The gardens are absolutely stunning in summer! Right in the centre of town is this imposing and impressive Cathedral. Because who doesn’t love ferris wheels? Especially when they come with a view over the city! The colourful and quirky apartment block you’ve probably heard of with a tongue-twisting name should not go unseen!  If you’re not a vegetarian then you really can’t go past the opportunity to eat a schnitzel in its native land. If you’ve got more room in your itinerary for museums then the Leopold should be next on your list. Because… cake. Everyone loves cake. Go to Cafe Sacher for a coffee and the original cake itself. If you find yourself in Vienna during December then be sure to soak up the Christmas spirit by soaking yourself in some mulled wine (hot wine) with a sugary/spicy blend. Better yet, make it your next stop! If you don’t have any plans to visit Salzburg either before or after your time in Vienna, then be sure to at least make your way there for a day trip. The city of music is too beautiful to be missed! Vienna’s most renowned market is a great way to pass time and mingle with the locals or score yourself a bargain! Vienna features many gorgeous parks but none more so than stadtpark. If you so happen to be in Vienna during ball season, you really can’t go wrong by attending the famed Viennese Balls. Just be sure to dress your Sunday best, these things are fancy! The Danube connects many of Europe, ending at the Black Sea. It is best enjoyed on a sunny afternoon with some street food snacks or a BYO picnic box. Even though zoos are everywhere around the world, you can rarely say you’ve visited the oldest one in the world!  Still want more? Follow along on Instagram!"
16,"Planning a trip to Europe? Congratulations! Chances are if you are reading this you are new to travelling or at least new to the continent of Europe. Well, fear not, I’ve got you covered! I have been travelling to Europe solo for the last 8 years. My first experience was daunting and overwhelming, but since then I have visited at least once a year and sometimes up to five times a year. So if you are wondering about the travel costs in Europe, get your notepad ready! I’ve got all of the information below to help you plan and budget for your trip. So you’re planning a trip to Europe – exciting times! Europe is by far my most favourite part of the world to explore – so much so that I make sure I visit every year. But you will soon realise Europe is expensive if you don’t know where to go for your budget. Below I will break down the average daily cost of visiting each popular tourist country, as well as how to save money along the way. For reference, the below prices are costs per person, per day, on average spend. While this budget is a generalisation, you could easily budget to spend less or splurge and spend more. To put it simply, they’re somewhere in the middle! Prices for travel costs in Europe are accurate at the time of publishing in 2020. Daily cost: €182.19 The most expensive country in Europe on a daily basis goes to France. This probably doesn’t come as a surprise to many of you – I know I’m not shocked after many trips to Paris! But the high cost of visiting France is slightly inflated because of Paris. Most travellers visit Paris for a few days of jam-packed sightseeing and then hot tail it out of there to other European cities. Tips for budgeting: If you want to save money in France, venture beyond Paris. Food is very affordable throughout the country and even in Paris if you know where to go (hint: its the latin quarter). Stay at an Airbnb instead of a hotel. They’re way more affordable and you’ll have a much more local experience. Daily cost: €181.55 Another country I’m sure no one is surprised to see topping this list is Switzerland. Honestly just looking at things in expensive feels expensive! Breathing the clean mountain air feels expensive! Tips for budgeting: Shorten your stay. No matter which way you look at it, Switzerland is expensive in every way imaginable. If you have friends or family you can stay with, this will cut out a huge portion of the cost. Daily cost: €161.46 I visited Denmark in my early twenties and it was so expensive I gave up converting prices and just decided I couldn’t afford anything. If I remember correctly, I ate supermarket sandwiches for dinner and washed them down with a coke zero. Très chic! Tips for budgeting: Stay outside of Copenhagen. This is notoriously one of the most expensive cities in Europe. I can personally vouch for that! Daily cost: €133.63 I knew before I visited Iceland that it was going to be an expensive trip. The flight itself was a steal (Barcelona to New York via Reykjavik), offering a cheap stopover en route to NYC. Iceland is expensive in terms of hotels, food, petrol and entrance fees. Even to visit the waterfalls you need to pay an entrance fee! Tips for budgeting: Road trip between destinations and travel with a friend to split the costs. Affordable hotels are available throughout the country, especially where there is more demand in Reykjavik. Daily cost: €127.40 When you visit Europe for the first time it is highly likely London will be on your agenda. And for good reason! This iconic city is year after year the most visited city in the world. The main expense when visiting the United Kingdom is accommodation. It doesn’t help that the pound always performs favourably to most other world currencies. Tips for budgeting: Waitrose and Sainsbury’s are your friend. You can grab a quick sandwich snack to eat on the go and skip the expensive restaurants. Many if London’s museums are free, as are the parks and just walking around Soho will fill an entire day of entertainment. Other cities outside of London are much more affordable to visit. Daily cost: €124.14 This one may come as a bit of a surprise to you, because with cheap pizza and house wines, how could it be expensive!? While the food is affordable, the price to travel through Italy quickly adds up. Cities like Rome, Venice and Florence are the most expensive. Tips for budgeting: Get outside of the touristic cities and stay in small towns. Instead of staying in Florence, try Lucca. Instead of staying in Venice, stay in Verona. You can always take a train and make day trips! Daily cost: €122.66 When you think of the Netherlands, you think of Amsterdam. That’s normal! But I promise you there is so much more to the Netherlands beyond the city of Amsterdam. Besides, other cities are much cheaper to visit! The average price per day spent in the Netherlands is €122.66. But you can easily save money with these few tips. Tips for budgeting: Check in to an Airbnb in Amsterdam or a local hostel if that’s your style. You can also save money by splitting the cost with a friend. Street food is readily available in major cities and is not only cheap but tasty! Daily cost: €120.73 Finland is an expensive country to visit whether you’re in the capital, Helsinki, or further afield in small towns. Tips for budgeting: Try staying with a local family for a local experience. I stayed with a family in the lakes district and not only was it affordable but also gave me an insight into the local culture. Daily cost: €112.67 The most expensive city to visit in Sweden is Stockholm. But don’t let that stop you! There are some great free attractions plus the public transport is easy to use. Tips for budgeting: Use the public transport and swap restaurants for cheap eats and supermarket lunches. If your accommodation offers breakfast, make this your biggest meal of the day. Daily cost: €111.96 Spain is reasonably expensive to visit but as soon as you exit the big cities (like Barcelona and Madrid) it becomes a lot more affordable. Tips for budgeting: Swap big cities for small towns. Indulge in tapas and kick back with a jug of sangria! Daily cost: €110.33 Greece can be expensive but it doesn’t have to be. There are some great ways to save money, especially if you aren’t short on time. Local ferries are a great option for island hopping and they’re much more affordable than flying between the islands. Tips for budgeting: Use local transport to save on travel costs between the islands. It will take a little longer but it is the journey, not the destination that matters! If you are carefully considering travel costs in Europe, sometimes you have to sacrifice time to save money. Daily cost: €109.47 Ireland is one of my favourite countries to explore in Europe. It is so naturally beautiful and sets the scene for a perfect road trip! As soon as you leave Dublin, the country becomes much more affordable to enjoy. Tips for budgeting: Road trips are a great way to see this country but public transport is much more affordable if you’re on a budget. Daily cost: €106.78 Germany is in the heart of Europe, meaning it is really well connected with trains. This makes for a great adventure by land and will also save you money. The large cities like Berlin, Cologne and Munich are much more expensive than the countryside. Tips for budgeting: Swap the major cities for countryside escapes. Daily cost: €18.75 Serbia is the most affordable country on a day-to-day cost analysis. If you are carefully considering travel costs in Europe, Serbia is a great option for budget travellers. Belgrade is a surprising city with so much to offer visitors and I can highly recommend it! Daily cost: €23.00 Ukraine is another great choice for travellers considering travel costs in Europe. The local transport might seem daunting at first (as no signs are in English). However, you would be surprised how much you can converse with hand gestures and broken English! Daily cost: €38.92 Russia is one of the more affordable countries in Europe to explore, however Moscow and St Petersburg are still quite expensive. If you’re up for a real adventure, head out into the small towns and spend more time off the beaten path. Daily cost: €41.31 One of my friends recently went on her honeymoon to Albania. It isn’t the ordinary first choice for a honeymoon but she said it was a great adventure! Albania is still one of the least visited countries in Europe. This makes it very affordable and quite underrated. Daily cost: €51.04 Still in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria is a great choice for budget travellers. As you might have already noticed the more you venture East, the more affordable it becomes. Daily cost: €54.85 Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of my fondest travel memories. This country is so underrated and the locals are so welcoming to foreigners. To save money on my trip, I stayed with a local Bosnian family in Blaggaj. They were kind enough to cook me breakfast every day and even drive me to Mostar each day! Daily cost: €57.68 Budapest has become one of the most sought after cities to explore in Europe. The capital city of Hungary has a high supply of accommodation, making it affordable to stay for a while. Daily cost: €58.58 Finally we round out our list with Poland. This country is often overlooked by visitors, although many travellers make their way to Krakow in the South. However if you make it all this way, I would strongly encourage you to spend more time in Poland! The capital city of Warsaw has been one of my favourite capital cities in Eastern Europe.

17,"Italy has no shortage of beautiful towns to explore. The likes of Cinque Terre and the Amalfi Coast offer a handful of towns each, and are often where our mind wanders when considering small towns to explore in Italy. But there are so many more beautiful towns dotted throughout Italy that you haven’t yet heard of. And with that, we’ve listed the best small towns in Italy to explore and enjoy La Dolce Vita. Located in Italy’s Apulia region, Alberobello is known across the world for its whitewashed stone huts and their conical roofs. These buildings are known as trulli and have become a huge drawcard for travellers in search of this iconic skyline in Italy’s Puglia region. And despite Alberobello being home to just 10,000 citizens, you will find many more travellers visiting on a daily basis to wander around the town’s cobblestone alleyways, dotted with trulli at every turn. If there’s just one town on the Amalfi Coast that has my heart, I’d say it is lying somewhere in Positano. There are many beautiful towns to visit in the Amalfi Coast, so be sure to plan on spending at least a week in the region. However, if you are short on time or just want to visit the highlights, I cannot recommend any single place in all of Italy more than Positano. This quaint and charming town is nestled into the cliffside of the Amalfi coastline, with pastel-coloured sunrises and calm, balmy sunsets. There truly is nowhere in the world quite like it.  Manarola is one of Italy’s most recognisable small towns. Located in the Riomaggiore commune in the La Spezia provence, Manarola is the second-smallest of the famous Cinque Terre towns. The town was once part of the Republic of Genoa, when it was home to a castle and watchtower to protect the city and region from pirates. Nowadays, the most famous attraction in the town is Sciacchetrà, a sweet dessert wine. Bellagio is commonly considered the jewel in the crown that is Lake Como. This region in the North of Italy is simply full of beautiful small towns, but none are more beautiful than Bellagio. The town is famous for its views over the lake, as well as boasting not one but two villas – Villa Serbelloni and Villa Melzi. You can easily visit this town in half a day, as you can access Bellagio by public ferry from any of the surrounding towns dotted along the lake. Tuscany is a region full of beautiful cities and towns, as well as luxurious countryside villas and AirBnBs. With so much to see and do in the region, you really could spend your entire holiday just in this region alone. However, if you are looking for the most quintessential small town, the medieval town of San Gimignano is a must visit. The town’s historic centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, protected by a stone wall around the circumference. Oh, and did we mention this town is said to have the world’s best gelato? Run, don’t walk! Located on Italy’s rugged Ligurian coast in the northwest of the country, Vernazza is iconically built into the coastline. The town is most recognised by Doria Castle, hugging the rocks in all of its dramatic glory. This town enjoys epic sunsets year-round, so be sure to spend your time outdoors and enjoying the late summer nights Italy is so famous for. Need more travel inspiration? Follow us on Instagram."
18,"The French countryside is full of cute towns, villages, vineyards and beautiful landscapes to explore. After visiting France more times than I can count, I’ve put together my list of favourite places in the French countryside not to be missed. Viviers is a small commune in the south of France that is not very talked about, much less visited. There are some fabulous small towns in the south of France that experience hardly any tourist visitors. This makes them incredibly unique and makes it possible to feel like a local. Although the Chocolat film was shot in Flavigny-sur-Ozerain, for me Viviers is the closest I have felt to a similar experience. I have had the pleasure of visiting Beaune twice now and I love it so much I’d jump at the opportunity to return a third time. There’s just something so magical about this city that is only a little over two hours by train from Paris. Beaune is also the centre of Burgundy, the capital of wine-making in France. Thus if you’re a wine drinker like me, you absolutely must visit Beaune! Annecy is one of those picture perfect postcard towns you have to pinch yourself to know that it is real. This alpine town is located on Lake Annecy and the glacial waters flow through the town that is built on canals. Picture yourself walking along cobblestone alley ways, getting lost in the smells of freshly baked croissants and French language as the shopkeepers converse across the streets. I had long dreamed of visiting Colmar before I finally visited in Spring a couple of years ago. If there’s just one town in the French countryside that you have to visit, this would be it. Colmar is located in the northeast of France with extreme proximity to the German border. This has resulted in a unique blend of Franco-German architecture in playful colours which really pop during Spring/Summer with the fresh blooms. Another great town nearby is Eguisheim, reachable by bicycle through the vineyards. The Loire Valley is as dreamy as you would imagine. This is the perfect day trip from Paris but if you have the time, it is even better to spend a few days in the Loire Valley. Here you can explore a range of old chateaus that have been beautifully restored as well as castles of grand proportions. Located in Provence, the picture perfect town of Gordes sits on a hill overlooking the French countryside below. This is a great day trip from Avignon nearby or you could rent a home from one of the locals to feel oh-so-Frenchy in no time. Located on the Rhône River in the Provence region of France, Arles doesn’t get talked about nearly as much as it should. This gorgeous town in the French countryside is the perfect stop as part of a larger south of France tour. I had never heard of Chateau de Cormatin until I was standing in the grounds marvelling at the manicured gardens. As far as chateau restorations go, this is one of the best I have seen by a private owner. The family-run chateau now exists solely as a tourist destination and is a great glimpse in to the lives of aristocrats who once used these homes as seasonal vacation homes from Paris. Located in Normandy on the Aure river, Bayeux is a small commune in France. This picture perfect countryside escape is best enjoyed in the Spring Summer months when the flowers bloom and the lush greenery takes over the town. Eze is just a short drive from Nice in the South of France but its’ unique location makes it feel a world away. Located on the edge of a cliff, Eze overlooks the ocean and has stunning panoramic views. It has the feel of a small French countryside village but the appeal of being located near to Nice and Cannes. Over to you! Where will you visit in France this summer!?"
19,"Casual and unassumingly cool, the capital of Finland serves as a great pit stop to begin your Euro adventures, particularly if you’re looking for a glimpse in to Scandinavian life. With a heavy focus on old meets new, Helsinki has a strong design-focus in the present day, whilst managing to preserve and celebrate its architectural history that has stood the test of time. Although once at the hands of the Swedes and later the Russian Empire, the Finnish capital retains its own identity with distinctively German architecture (the city was largely designed by Carl Engel). So with just 48 hours to snap happy my way around the city, here’s a complete photo diary of my time here!  The cafe scene in Helsinki is slowly emerging and gaining popularity. Though not as progressed as other Scandinavian city, the few hipster haunts I did manage to find were really innovate and unique.  Outdoor entertaining is seasonal at best, and visiting in Spring still meant 0 degrees much of the time! Hot chocolates are a must.  Architecture in Helsinki.  The cities’ attractions are mostly dominated by churches of different beliefs. Other than Helsinki Cathedral, be sure to check out Uspenski Cathedral and the “rock church”, a church quite literally built in to a rock!

20,"On our recent trip to Europe we visited a few countries over the course of a month – including a number of cities and towns in Switzerland, a handful of cities in Italy, the countryside of France and of course, Paris. As train connections throughout these three countries are extremely frequent and reliable, we decided to travel the entire journey by train – even though some of the destinations we wanted to visit were a bit out of the way or hard to reach by train, we still managed to take most of the journey by rail (albeit for a ferry ride or two!) For our three weeks in Europe we used a 22 day Eurail Global Pass for the purpose of review here on the blog. So – what did we think? Is the Eurail Global Pass really worth it? In simplest terms, the Eurail Global Pass is a ticket you buy that gives you unlimited train travel throughout 28 countries in Europe within a certain time frame (see a full list of countries in the above image). By way of example, we were using a 22 day continuous (3 weeks) Eurail Global Pass, which meant we could travel through all the countries highlighted in green and listed above. For those three weeks we could catch as many trains as we liked on our journey in Europe, though given my boyfriend and I have both already been to Europe before on separate occasions, we wanted to choose specific small towns to visit in Switzerland, Italy and France.  The cost for a 22 day continuous Eurail global pass is currently: $788 AUD ($601 USD) in second class or; $968 AUD ($738 USD in first class). However the passes come in a variety of different offers, ranging from 5 days continuous travel to 3 months continuous travel. If you don’t intend to do so much train travel each day and would instead like to break it up into longer travel days, you can also select passes of “15 travel days within 2 months” and other variations. See a full list here. So for us on the 22 day pass, the daily price per person worked out to be $35 per day, per person for unlimited train travel in second class. Due to the small price difference and the short nature of our trip, we selected an upgrade to first class, working out to be $44 per day, per person.  There are a few things to consider when determining whether the Eurail pass is suitable for you. Firstly: Where exactly in Europe are you travelling? Trains get cheaper (and slower) the further East you travel, so to maximise the value of the pass you need to weigh up whether the pass will work out cheaper than buying individual tickets at each destination and travelling station to station. If you are travelling primarily in Eastern Europe, I would not suggest purchasing a Eurail global pass or indeed any Eurail pass, as it will be much cheaper for you to purchase point-to-point tickets. However if you are travelling primarily or entirely in Western & Central Europe, I would suggest reading on! Secondly: Read up about required seat reservations and supplements you may need to pay, regardless of having the pass. For example in Italy we found ourselves paying 10 euros per person, per train journey for the seat reservation supplement. While that might not sound like much, it soon adds up after a while! Whether or not you need a seat reservation before boarding a train depends on the service and journey you take, but as an example we were forced to pay 10 euros for a 30 minute journey from Como to Milan per person, followed by another 10 euros per person for the journey from Milan to Naples (even though the second journey was much longer in length!)  This review wouldn’t be painting a realistic picture without mention of the downsides to the Eurail Global Pass: the additional expenses. As we’ve established, the benefits of the Eurail Global Pass are ease of use and travel throughout Europe. But those benefits soon become diminished when you add extra expenses and effort in the form of seat reservations (whereby you pay a small fee to reserve a seat on the train, typically only necessary for popular routes). But the fact of the matter is that the supplements soon add up. A few euros here, 10 euros there… before you know it you’ve racked up a substantial sum of extras. Add to that the (new to me) fact that not all trains are included in the Eurail pass, including popular routes like the Glacier Express in Switzerland. Part of our journey was covered with the pass, however 1/3 of the journey was not, costing us a col $330 AUD for x2 tickets to cover that part of the journey (including a 25% reduction rate for being pass holders). While a 25% discount is nice for the area not included, Switzerland is an expensive country to say the least and for a few hours slow train journey, we found $115 per person to be an expense we couldn’t justify – but had to partake in nonetheless as we had a paid hotel reservation that night on the other side of the train journey. Thus I would strongly recommend doing your homework before booking the pass, as the main benefit (ease of travel – there’s no secret the pass is more expensive than buying tickets point-to-point) becomes impacted when you have to keep paying more and doing more research in advance of your trip.  Having travelled in both first and second class on Eurail routes before I’ve come to learn there aren’t too many differences between the two, though the difference is mainly the level of comfort for the extra price. Whether you choose first or second class really depends on your budget as both are comfortable – but for the sake of helping you to make a decision, here are the distinctions between the two: First Class is more expensive, though the level of comfort on board is slightly more appealing for the following reasons: less travellers meaning quicker boarding and more empty seats to yourself, more space to yourself in the cabins, a wider chair that has been less used and a noticeably quieter cabin. The choice is yours.  I was eager to try the Eurail Global Pass because to be completely frank, there is no better way to see Europe than by train. Sure, hopping on a flight might make the travel distance sound shorter, but when you add all that time getting to the airport, checking-in, waiting to board, and doing it all over again on the other side, the time spent travelling works out to be almost exactly the same much of the time. The countryside scenery is also another great reason to choose trains over planes, and you’ll be able to see more when kicking back in your train compartment than you ever would when focusing on the road. On that note, there’s much less worry when you choose trains over driving as you won’t need to navigate the roads (or their drivers)! Thus even if you don’t purchase a Eurail pass for your travels in Europe, I would still recommend travelling by train to reach your destinations.  If you are travelling primarily or entirely in Western & Central Europe on quick whirlwind trip where you will travel by train nearly every day, then I would suggest the Eurail global pass is for you. However if you have time on your side and plan to take a slower journey through Europe, I would suggest opting for the “22 days over 3 months” type of pass (they come in a range of options). If you are travelling primarily or entirely in Eastern & or Southern Europe, I would not suggest purchasing a Eurail Pass at all, as these trains are cheaper and don’t make the investment worth while. Also the Eurail passes don’t cover ALL countries in Eastern/Southern Europe. The main benefits we found by using the Eurail Global Pass were: ease of travel, flexibility for our travel plans, travelling in first class for a small additional cost, and having the Eurail map as a constant point of reference to mark out our travel plans in Europe. Overall we really loved using the pass but it should be no secret that the pass is no cheaper than buying point to point tickets, which is often a cheaper option, especially if you aren’t using trains every day.   World of Wanderlust received a Eurail Pass for the purpose of this review. All opinions are my own!"
21,"Italy is a country rich in history, culture, heritage and of course, carbs! Over the years travelling I have some of the best kept secrets in Italy. These are not the cities and towns you read about in guidebooks. These are the secret small towns your Italian grandmother tells you to visit. The towns you thought only existed in Hollywood films.  With a distinctive medieval charm and a reputation for the annual Palio horse race, Siena is often overlooked in favour of Florence and or Pisa, though holds just as much charm! The cities’ main attraction is the Piazza known as Il Campo, though be sure to step inside the Siena Cathedral for one of the most impressive interiors you will find the world over. Read more: A Quick Guide to Siena, Italy  Lake Como is best discovered at a slow and steady pace, wandering throughout the many towns and villages that sprawl across the edges of the lake. Torno is one such small town I discovered on my time in Como – a small and unassuming little gem just a short ferry ride from Como itself. Read more: A quick guide to Lake Como  Just a short drive from popular Florence is nearby Lucca, a city renowned for its renaissance walls, terracotta rooftops and cobblestone streets. Lucca is best seen from the top of the Guinigi tower – just be sure to pack some comfortable walking shoes and visit before lunch – there are 230 stairs for the journey to the top! If you can manage the climb you will be rewarded with 360 degree views over the city. Read more: Where to Visit in Tuscany  Throughout my time on a vespa traversing the Amalfi coast, my favourite discovery was hands down the hillside ton of Ravello. Located 36dm above sea level, this charming little town is known for its incredible views, limoncello, gardens and vineyards.

San Gimignano is one of the most picturesque locations in Tuscany and indeed Italy, especiallywhen viewed from atop the bell tower. Be sure to drop by Gelateria Dondoli for that famous gelato! Read more: A Quick Guide to San Gimignano  Another favourite location on Lake Como was the highly popular (and hardly a secret in the region) but too charming not to include; Bellagio. This elegant little town is best visited in the early morning or late afternoon, as it is popular for day visitors so best discovered before or after the crowds. Read more: A quick guide to Lake Como  The first destination for many when visiting the Amalfi Coast is Sorrento, though often visitors are quick to flock onwards to popular Positano or catch the ferry to Capri. After choosing to base ourselves in Sorrento, we soon discovered this would become one of our favourite destinations on the Amalfi Coast, although only booked as a convenience to explore other destinations. Sorrento is best enjoyed in the evening time and is full of great restaurants and wine bars to discover. Read more: A Weekend in Sorrento See more of my adventures on Instagram"
22,"I don’t know about you but I love a cliché. And when I think of Europe I think about sipping an Aperol spritz in the summer sunshine, riding a donkey through the hills of a remote Greek island or eating so many warm, flaky croissants that I almost turn in to one. Hence, we have created the complete Europe bucket list. Europe is full to the brim with clichés and I for one cannot wait to be a part of them with each and every annual quest to my all-time favourite continent. If you’re anything like me then you have arrived at the right place for a perfectly quintessential Europe bucket list. Here we go! When you think of Venice you think of canals, water, and singing gondoliers. Sure, there’s more to Venice than initially meets the eye, but the first time visitor need only come with one goal in mind: see and experience as much of the city as possible from the water. Begin with a gondola ride for the quintessential Venetian experience, later upgrading to the (much) less expensive water taxis or even more local ferry network. With so much to see and history practically staring you in the face, Venice is a city that deserves a bucket list in itself!  Although there are many reasons to visit Belgium, drinking beer has got to be in the top 10. Along with waffles and frites, Belgium has a few claims to fame worth taste testing and there could be no better way to wash them down than with a local brew! Read more: 12 Reasons to Visit Belgium If there’s one thing I remember most from my first trip to Amsterdam at twenty years of age, it is the amount of close calls I had walking in to, away from, around, and waiting for cyclists. This city is a death trap waiting to happen for anyone who pauses for a moment and stops paying attention! But as they say, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em! Be sure to hop on a bike and see the city from the streets, meandering through small alleyways and through neighbourhoods on the cusp of the city. Read more: Amsterdam Bucket List Is there anything more Spanish than a decent portion of street stall churros!? These deep fried goodies are best lathered in sauce (you can’t go past dulce de leche). You’ll find them all over Europe at street stalls luring you in with their sugary aroma! One thing I never thought would be easy when travelling solo was to make friends and meet people from all walks of life. I soon discovered that not only was it easy, but also one of the greatest rewards travel brings. Now having friends in all corners of the globe – from different races, religion, cultures, beliefs… I have learned to shape my own. Now that’s something they can’t teach you in school! One castle, two castles, three castles, floor. While I won’t say the same for churches, somehow the fascination with castles just never seems to rub off on me and I could keep exploring the myths and legends of each castle for as long as I live. Luckily for me, Europe is an absolute mecca when it comes to castles (and LOTS of them!) Ask anyone where they would recommend you visit in Europe and I can assure you 9 times out of 10 you will be told not to miss out on Prague. The Czech capital brings together many eras, ideas, and most noticeably, architecture. Look one way for gothic influence, look another for medieval marvels and before you know it you have walked through centuries of history in one compact Old Town. Read more: A Walking Tour of Prague This list would never be complete without mention of gelato (and a photo of one of my favourite stores on the Amalfi Coast, for good measure!) Eataly, as I’d prefer to call it, is full of great gelato no matter where you find yourself in the country and I’d almost say with certainty that this is a time-honoured tradition itself (eating the stuff, that is!) Read more: Where to find the best gelato in Italy Vienna is hands down one of Europe’s prettiest city, if not THE most. Imperial and imposing, Vienna has so elegantly stood the test of time. One of the major highlights of this city is the expansive art collections on offer from the ages, particularly for attendees of the Belvedere. You also can’t miss the chance to see living art in the flesh at Hundertwasserhaus. Read more: Vienna Bucket list “Europe” and “cool” are often two words you will read together, but none more so than in reference to the capital of Hungary. Although Budapest is well and truly discovered by every sense of the word, there’s still an under the radar appeal that never seems to leave this city. If I could choose anywhere to live as an ex-pat in all of Europe, Budapest would be an obvious first choice. Read more: Budapest Bucket list If what’s cooler than being cool is ice cold, then Poland, you are quite frosty. This country is one of the “must visit” Eastern European destinations for a number of reasons, but especially for its ability to capture, freeze, and honour its history. I first visited Poland eight years ago, travelling only to Krakow. Since then I have been back to visit the capital, Warsaw, which I think flies totally under the radar (and provides a realistic glimpse in to communism in Eastern Europe). Read more: Spotlight on Warsaw, Poland The only thing cooler than going East is going more East, and by that I mean discovering the likes of Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and many more! So many of my favourite places in Europe are in the East and the more isolated they are, the more interesting they become. If you haven’t yet visited Romania, this should be near the top of your list, especially if you love vampire myths, mysteries, and spooky castles! Read more: 8 Places you Must visit in Romania As much as I love Copenhagen, I love to complain about the price of it more. I’m almost certain this would have to be the most expensive city to visit in Europe (no research to back my claim but an empty wallet to show for it). This should by no means stop you from visiting, but you will thank me later if you go by the “less is more” mantra and visit for just a couple of days.

Read more: 10 Things you Must Do in Croatia As surprising as it is, Oktoberfest in the South of Germany begins mid-September and runs through to the beginning of October… and for beer lovers, there really is no better time to visit Munich! Be sure to allow a few days in the South of Germany whilst you are here, especially if you’d like to make a day trip to the likes of Neuschwanstein Castle (arguably the prettiest castle in all of Europe!) If there’s one thing you can’t always avoid when travelling throughout Europe its a rip off (or four!) Whether it be paying too much, being short changed or the old “you’re so beautiful, take this red rose” trick… don’t be afraid to be fooled at least once! Perhaps the single most impressive architectural display in Europe is Saint Basil’s Cathedral in the Red Square, Moscow. The mid-16th century basilica is symbolic of a visit to the Russian capital and can’t be missed!

23,"The Ararat Park Hyatt is a slick and modern affair. On my recent visit to Moscow, I was able to see just why this is one of the most popular hotels in the city. Situated in the heart of the Russian capital, I found myself within walking distance of all the top attractions: the Red Square, Kremlin, and St Basil’s Cathedral were all just a short walk away. Here’s how to make the most of your stay in Moscow when choosing the Ararat Park Hyatt! Inspired and named after the Armenian restaurant that once stood in its place, it features Armenian fine dining in the Café Ararat restaurant, a chapel and Armenian interior details throughout such as glass beavers which are said to be a token of good luck. The hotel is located in the heart of Moscow, across the road lies the famous Bolshoi theatre and the most prestigious shopping malls GUM & TSUM. It’s only a few minutes walk from Red Square and the Kremlin making it an obvious choice for those who are visiting Moscow to see its famous landmarks. As with much of Moscow, this hotel is a glamorous and opulent affair. For starters, the rooms are beautifully designed with mirrored walls and marble details… leaving me with an impression of what life must have been like as a Russian aristocrat in the time of revolts and revolutions. My personal recommendation would be to stay in one of the Winter Garden suites, where you’ll have your own private rooftop terrace overlooking the modern-day Moscow skyline. Bliss!  The Ararat Park Hyatt is home to one of the city’s most famous rooftop bars which is open to the public and consequently attracts a fashionable crowd of Muscovites. Thus, even if you don’t stay here it is well worth your while to pay a visit to the rooftop terrace. You’ll be mingling with locals and guests alike, who come here for the breathtaking views over the Kremlin (and to socialize over the vodka-based cocktails!) For breakfast there’s a buffet offering fruits, smoked salmon, caviar, fresh breads and bircher muesli or an à la carte menu with an even wider selection of breakfast dishes. The American pancakes served with honey butter and maple syrup are delicious and come personally recommended.  7 Coffee Shops you Must Visit in Moscow Top 10 Things to do in Moscow for First Timers Moscow Bucket List World of Wanderlust contributor Faye visited Ararat Park Hyatt Moscow as a guest, however opinions and photos remain that of the author!"
24,"On this trip to Amsterdam, I was eager to explore the famous Nine Streets of Amsterdam a little further in-depth. But if you don’t really know what these nine streets are or what purpose they serve, you’ve come to the right place! This is your complete guide to the Nine Streets of Amsterdam. Amsterdam’s nine streets are at the heart of boutique shopping in Amsterdam. The streets are filled with local designers, one-off cafes, vintage thrift stores and small concept stores. If you’ve come to Amsterdam in search of a new wardrobe, this is where you’ll find the best the city has to offer. We’ll start with thrift stores which are having a complete revival of late (hoorah!) With many people now more eco-conscious than ever, shopping for vintage clothes is a trend worth following. Amsterdam has a lot to offer the vintage shopper and the most central of these is located in the 9 streets. Episode Vintage is located at Berenstraat 1. This small corner store is so packed with vintage grabs that you’ll find it difficult to maneuver through the store, but patience definitely pays off! There’s much more on offer than just clothes – with bags, shoes, and hats in abundance. Address: Berenstraat 1, 1016 GG Amsterdam, Netherlands One thing is for sure when you visit Amsterdam: you can’t leave empty handed. With so many talented local designers, it is impossible not to make a purchase or two (personally I filled an entire suitcase). These are some great local designers to seek out in the 9 streets: A collection of local designers, We are Labels houses a wide range but remains carefully curated. Visit during January for some incredible sales! Address: Herengracht 356, 1016 CG Amsterdam, Netherlands This feminine space is the perfect dreamy escape where you’ll find everything on-trend. I personally loved their selection of warm woolen knits. Address: Wolvenstraat 15, 1016 EM Amsterdam, Netherlands Perhaps my favourite store in all of Amsterdam, Mendo is home to a huge range of coffee table books covering every category. Address: Berenstraat 11, 1016 GG Amsterdam, Netherlands If you’re looking to pump up your art collection or just fancy a visit to the gallery, artshop de salon was my favourite art find in the 9 streets. Address: Wolvenstraat 13, 1016 EM Amsterdam, Netherlands Fancy a pit stop? We’ve got the best cafes and sweet treat stores for a pick-me-up! Hands down the cutest cafe in the 9 streets, Pluk is always full to the brim with customers (and for good reason). If you visit in the warmer months try to grab a table outdoors for ultimate people watching Address: Reestraat 19, 1016 DM Amsterdam, Netherlands If you just fancy a coffee no frills, then stop by Coffee Company on Berestraat. This is one of those tiny shops that makes up in quality for what it lacks in size! Address: Berenstraat 6, 1016 GH Amsterdam With your itinerary in tow, the best way to peruse the 9 streets is indeed, on foot (contrary to what the photo suggests!) However if you are visiting the 9 streets as part of a larger Amsterdam itinerary, I would highly suggest renting a bike to explore the city. Many of the hotels in Amsterdam will have bikes available for rent or included in your room rate. We stayed at the Andaz Amsterdam and used the hotel bikes for our entire stay and honestly, I can’t imagine our time in Amsterdam without them!"
25,"When I first visited Versailles some five years ago on my first (ever) solo trip overseas, I arrived in mid-January to a chilling -3 degrees, lifeless and almost gloomy Palace of Versailles. Though I still fell in love with Versailles (who could not!?), I was disappointed not to be able to walk in the grounds and experience the gardens, which are as much an attraction as the interior of the palace itself. But alas, rewards come to those who wait! Five years later and I recently found myself on a trip to Versailles with fellow Australian Lisa (The Wandering Lens), on a photographic journey with our sponsor Olympus Australia. For years I have been using Olympus cameras and for years I have been fumbling around the camera’s settings like a kid in a candy store, discovering new ways to photograph better as I keep travelling the world. But when I was offered the chance to meet Lisa, a trained photographer with decades of experience, I couldn’t say no!  As someone who once shot on “auto mode” (alas, not for the last few years) I feel it is my duty to share some super duper basics when shooting with your camera. Manual mode provides a much higher degree of freedom and creativity, so don’t be scared to give it a go! For shooting indoors, Lisa suggests a general rule of thumb: ISO at 800-1600 for interiors and 100-400 for bright sunlight (on my Olympus OMD EM5 Mark II I use the “Low” setting).  Walking around the Palace I noticed so many beautiful dashes of gold and rich colouring that I wanted to make sure I captured in my photos. I asked Lisa what editing program she uses, to which I was delighted to learn we both use Lightroom! Being a pro, Lisa is also accustomed to Photo Shop, though with lack of time and knowledge I think I’ll stick to small tweaks in Lightroom and if you’re just starting out, I would recommend doing the same. A minor but useful tip Lisa offered on this subject was to alter my white balance to cloudy, which noticeably brings out the gold tones and warms up the image without the need to edit afterwards.  Although both of us use mostly the 12-40mm lens when travelling (its a great all-round lens for every occasion), I recently received the 25mm pro lens to try out and I’ve gotta say… I’m hooked! The 25mm is great for shooting subjects up close (like pastries – I tend to gravitate towards those things) and items like flowers or shooting bokeh effect (blurring out the subjects out of focus).  As soon as we made our way to the gardens I flicked my ISO back to “Low” (or the lowest setting on your camera) and let the natural light work its magic. You can also use the front dial on the OMD EM5 Mark II to brighten or darken the image, choosing how much light the lens will let in. Although I’ve heard many photographers say it is better to shoot the image darker and bright it up in post-processing, Lisa insists it is better to photograph in “the right light”. This was especially important for me as I don’t shoot on RAW images, which still surprises most people but hey, if you can publish a book in pure JPEGs you can do anything!  Another handy little trick Lisa pointed out was how to shoot sun stars – capturing the light between the trees and creating a little natural magic! To shoot sun stars all you need to do is raise your “F stop” to 14 or higher and find the light. Be sure to stand really still!  Thanks for dropping by! Interested in the camera gear I use? I took all of the above images on my Olympus OMD EM5 Mark II. Most images are using my new 25mm PRO lens. Some of the landscape shots were taken with my 12-40mm PRO lens. I edit my photos with lightroom. You can find more of my photography tips and tricks here. Please leave any questions or lovely comments below – I would love to answer any Q’s!"
26,"Let there be no ambiguity here: I purely choose to revisit Italy again and again and again because of the food. It is what lures me back time and time again. Sure, the scenery is gorgeous no matter where you are – on the coastline, in the Northern lakes district or floating down a canal in Venice… but the food is what draws me back every single time. And if you’re wondering which foods you must try in Italy, you’ve come to the right place. Below is a list (take it as a check list, if you will) of the best foods to try in Italy. Being a vegetarian myself I only every indulge in a handful of these (making up for in sweets what I lack by way of savoury selections), however to be fair to the meat eaters I have included all the most popular dishes and where to find them. It should also be noted that Italian food isn’t really Italian food. Each region in Italy specialises in something – be that a certain dish or type of cooking – so really, you should aim to eat regional in Italy. Thus I have also included where to find the best, most authentic version of each dish to really help you taste the flavours of Italy!    I’ll start this list with my all time favourite (and perhaps yours) – Gelato. As a huge fan of ice cream for my past 20-something years of existence, I was in a world of delight when I first arrived in Italy at 17 years of age and tasted my first gelato. Coming from a small town on an island in Australia, I had never tried gelato until this point, which is probably a good thing in hindsight as no gelato across the world will ever compare with the Italian’s. My favourite gelaterias across Italy are tried and tested (usually at least 10 times) and include: Florence – La Carraia // Rome – Gelateria I Caruso // Milan – Il Massimo del Gelato // Sorrento – Primavera Originating in the region of Veneto, Tiramisu is an Italian classic dessert that has swept the world by storm. You’ll find many variations on the classic dish and in all honesty, sometimes a more contemporary take outdoes the original… but in Italy it is hard to come by a bad house-made Tiramisu! In Rome check out Flavio al Velavevodetto for a perfectly portioned individual serving. Panna Cotta, a creamy white dessert topped often with a drizzle of caramel sauce is said to originate from the region of Piedmont in Italy. Panna Cotta is light but holds itself with just enough solidity to not fall apart on the plate, but still fall apart in your mouth. A true Italian delight! In Rome check out Pompi Cafe & in Venice be sure to try the Panna Cotta at La Bitta. The origins of Carbonara are extraordinarily vague, however as it is a pasta dish we know it invariably comes from Italy, we’re just not sure which region to be precise (it is subject to much debate). The dish is usually served with spaghetti pasta in Italy, though you will find different variations throughout Italy and the world, with some chefs using fettucine, rigatoni, linguine, or even bucatini. The dish consists of a light eggy sauce, cheese, bacon, and pepper (traditionally there is no cream, peas or mushrooms as you might have tried back home). Rome – Da Danilo // Da Sergio // Da Enzo // Milan – Ristorante Da Oscar // Florence – Antico Noè // Venice – Al Chianti  This year I finally made it to Naples and let me be frank: I came here to try the pizza. Naples, a sprawling city in the Campania region, is the birthplace of pizza. The pizza in Naples comes in a variety of variations – large, small, crispy, doughy, lots of toppings, sparse toppings… you name it. There’s no denying this will be your best experience (in the world, ever), though a few of the faves have opened up stores in New York City, so you can also find a great pie there. Naples – Da Michelle, Pizzaria Starita, Di Matteo Who doesn’t love bruschetta!? This breaded dish can be ordered anywhere in Italy as a starter and you just know you can’t go wrong. The dish has its origins in central Italy but can be found in nearly every restaurant throughout the country, sometimes being offered complimentary to start an evening meal. Bruschetta is made with garlic rubbed bread, topped with a variation of toppings including tomatoes, cheese, onion, cured meats and/or vegetables. Its hard to go wrong with this Italian staple and you’ll find bruschetta available almost everywhere! This Sicilian regional dish is a popular antipasto made with eggplant, olives, capers and celery. Caponata is a great option for vegetarians in the summertime (the sun down South can get extremely overwhelming!) and of course you’ll find the best caponata at its origins in Sicily. Foccacia bread is made flat, plain inside, but topped with the likes of olives, olive oil and a variety of herbs. This is an easy dish to try and recreate back home, and luckily you will find the standard of foccacia bread fairly similar across Italy.  When in Campania you simply cannot go without trying the Aubergine Parmigiana, or in Italian you will find it on the menu as Melanzane alla Parmigiana. Being a vegetarian I can sometimes find it difficult eating abroad, however in Italy this is my absolute go-to dish. Essentially the dish consists of baked eggplant covered in a rich tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. The best parmigiana I had was in Positano at Le Tre Sorelle. You might immediately notice I didn’t type “Spaghetti Bolognese”, because in Italy, this dish isn’t necessarily served with spaghetti pasta! In fact, bolognese was born in Bologna, where the dish is most certainly not served with spaghetti, which instead hails from the South of Italy. Just order a “Tagliatelle alla Bolognese” and you’ll be fine. The best Bolognese in Bologna can be found, well, anywhere in restaurants throughout the city! As soon as you arrive in Italy you might realise the coffee culture here is very different to anywhere else in the world. First of all, the Italians are very passionate about their coffee. Second of all, it is all about the glorified espresso! Sure, you can still order different coffees (if you prefer your coffee less strong, order a caffè Americano). Rome – Rosati // Milan: Biancolatte // Florence: Scudieri // Venice: Torrefazione Cannaregio There is again a little contention when it comes to discerning the origins of ravioli, but the earliest records show ravioli in both Tuscany and Venice… but any further discussion would be speculation, so I shall avoid at all costs! When in Rome drop by Trattoria Monti for a spectacular ravioli in typical Italian home-style cooking.  Would this be a complete Italian foods list without lasagna!? The answer is most definitely no. As a vegetarian I love trying veggie alternatives on the classic dish, though if you eat meat you really can’t go past the classic lasagna with that rich bolognese sauce (10 years ago before vegetarianism it was one of my favourite dishes my mother cooks!) To play it safe and follow the recommendation of a meat eater, check out these 15 Best Places for lasagna in Rome. Again, many regions lay claim to gnocchi; potato dumplings that are thick, heavy & hearty. Usually served in a creamy sauce, gnocchi is incredibly indulgent but entirely delicious – you must try it at least once! You’ll find gnocchi on menus everywhere but for my preference, I order it only at those swanky restaurants where you pay way too much for way too little food, but when it comes to gnocchi a little goes a long way! You might be surprised to see prosciutto on the list as I’ve been a vegetarian for far longer than I have been travelling, but my boyfriend tells me it absolutely cannot go ignored on a list of must eat foods for Italy! Essentially prosciutto is a flavorous dry-cured ham that can be found all throughout Italy. happy eating in Italia!  "
27,"If this is your first time in Moscow, you have come to the right place. The Red Square and St Basil’s Cathedral are just a couple of the sights that attract visitors to Moscow every year. Dare I say, nothing beats seeing them with your own eyes. But there are so many more things to see and do in Moscow. You could easily spend four days here and barely scratch the surface. Here is your complete guide to help you plan your trip to the capital city of Russia!  The Red Square is like an open-air museum. St Basil’s cathedral with its multi-hued domes is located one end and the State Historical Museum to the other. If you want to learn all about the history of Russia, then this museum ought to be on your Moscow list. It offers a great history of the Romanov era and is entirely fascinating. There is also plenty of shopping to be done in the historic shopping arcade GUM. This shopping centre is however quite fancy! Here you will find a plethora of designer brands and trend-setting locals perusing them.  St Basil’s cathedral has become the icon of Moscow and nothing can prepare you for seeing it with your own eyes. This architectural masterpiece is made up of 11 churches in total, each one located in one of the cathedral’s domes. Don’t just marvel at it from the outside, go inside and learn all about its history. Red Square, Moscow, Russia, 109012 The Kremlin is the official residence of the President and the Russian Federation. It is a historic square of beautiful palaces and ornate cathedrals and integral to the culture, history and pride of Russia. Moscow, Russia, 103073 If you’re one of the lucky few who has reserved tickets early enough in advance, then you’re in for a once in a lifetime experience. If however, you haven’t managed to secure ballet tickets then visiting the interior of the Bolshoi theatre is a must. Viewings are held on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 12.15pm and you have to get there at about 10.15 in order to get your hands on a golden ticket. Theatre Square, 1, Moscow, Russia, 125009 There are few quiet spaces in the center of Moscow, so those in the know flock to Patriarch’s Ponds to enjoy a peaceful moment. On a sunny day, there is no better place to enjoy the sunshine and a refreshing mojito al fresco than the Pavilion at Patriarshy which is located in the heart of the gardens. The Moscow conservatory is a classical music institute of high esteem. Every great Russian musician has played or taught here in their life, and in doing so they become a star in their own right. Watching a concert here is a must for any great classical music lover. Bolshaya Nikitskaya ulitsa 13/6, Moscow Whilst nearly everyone has heard of French Impressionism, not many people have heard of Russian Impressionism. This newly opened museum houses what was once the private collection of Russian businessman Boris Mints who has opened it up to the public in the hope of revolutionizing Russian Impressionism. It showcases some beautiful examples of Russian art by artists such as Korovin, Grabar and Serov. 15 Leningradsky Prospekt. Bldg. 11. Metro Dinamo, Belorusskaya. Located on Red Square you’ll find Lenin’s tomb which is the resting place of Vladimir Lenin. Red Square, Moscow, Russia Whether you’ve heard of Maxim Gorky or not, the house of this famous Russian writer is still worth visiting. The beautiful art nouveau house was gifted to the writer upon his return to Moscow from exile in Italy. The interior is spectacular with stained glass windows, sculpted features and a library overflowing with books from his private collection. Malaya Nikitskaya ul., 6/2, стр. 5, Moscow, Russia, 121069  The Kazan cathedral is located on Red Square and is somewhat dwarfed by St Basil’s cathedral which receives all of the attention. It is a beautiful example of a Russian orthodox church and shouldn’t be overlooked. Follow along on Instagram for more adventures!"
28,"For my 25th Birthday, I was in search of a new and exciting destination to travel to. I was looking for somewhere I could go with my mum to celebrate in style, so with the flip of a coin, we chose to visit Norway. Just weeks later, we were cruising the Norwegian fjords! Living in Australia there isn’t really anywhere we could have chosen that was further away, so we wanted to make sure that when we arrived we could kick back, relax, and leave the hard work of planning and putting into action a trip to someone else. Thus it was decided: we would venture into the Norwegian Fjords on an 8-night cruise, exploring and adventuring throughout the day and relaxing and over-indulging through the night. Talk about striking a balance!  I took my first cruise over a year ago and believe me when I say I was the most shocked out of all of us that I had such a good time. Many moons ago cruising was a luxurious form of travel reserved for only the most affluent of guests, but cruising as we know it today invites any and all on board to travel the world in style, sophistication and with a superb range of benefits. To those who haven’t cruised before, when you book a cruise you pay an all-inclusive price that covers your accommodation on board, all meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), entertainment onboard (nightly theatre shows and live music), and transport to and from each port. With all of this included into one packaged price, I was surprised to learn that cruising then becomes a reasonably affordable way to travel, that allows you to fall asleep in one city and wake up in the next (thus cutting out those long travel days and giving you more time to explore each destination!)  Our cruise to Norway began in Southhampton, England, which gave me an excuse (I’ll take any!) to visit London and show my mum around one of my all-time favourite cities. From London, we caught the 1.5-hour train to Southhampton, boarded the ship and off we went! The first and final nights of the cruise were spent at sea, travelling to and from Norway. This gave us a great chance to kick the jet lag and adopt our new time zone as swiftly as possible so that when we arrived in Norway we were off and ready to hit the ground running! The first port of call for the cruise was Bergen, the second-largest city in Norway and known to most as the gateway to the fjords. Our second port of call was the small village of Flåm, a small but charming village and our first insight into life inside the fjords. The following day we arrived in Geiranger, another small village but full of breathtaking views and hikes to capture this narrow fjord, highly regarded as one of the most beautiful in all of Norway. Heading out of the fjords and back toward the coast, we then stopped at Ålesund, with incredible city views and charming Art Nouveau architecture. And for our final stop of the cruise we arrived in Stavanger, Norway’s third largest city with intricate alleyways and small streets to wander.  Every person who has ever cruised before will know that there are two trips when you take a cruise: one on land and one on board. While you spend your days exploring on foot, you spend your mornings, evenings and days at sea indulging in the easy-breezy life at sea. The best part of cruising for me is the ease of travel – there’s just one check-in and check out for the duration of your holiday, you do your travelling overnight whilst sleeping (thus having more time to explore when you arrive), and you sleep in the same bed every night, yet wake up in a new city. Bliss! The onboard offerings were almost always too tempting to resist: a delicious buffet of every breakfast item you could imagine, a continued all-day buffet, and a three-course meal every evening with a set dinner reservation. Each night the menu would change and we would taste flavours from all over the world, chatting with fellow cruisers and our wait staff who were also from all corners of the globe. The entertainment onboard was surprisingly my favourite highlight and especially worth mentioning for the talent alone. Each night we were treated to an evening performance, either by a special fly-in act or a cast ensemble who performed live theatre. It was the latter that I found most enjoyable, with many of the cast being Broadway-quality performers (and for those of you who have been reading my blog a while, you’ll know I have seen loads of shows!). For one of our days at sea, I treated my mum and me to a day at the spa for manicures. We sat there giggling and talking about how we could get used to being pampered and so well looked after on holiday. As someone who is used to overnight train journeys, googling where to eat vegetarian food in a new city and living out of a suitcase, it was an uber indulgence to travel with Celebrity Cruises and spend my birthday trip actually on holiday!  I travelled to Norway as a guest of Celebrity Cruises, who I cannot thank enough for making my 25th birthday such a memorable one!"

30,"Sometimes in life you’ve just gotta go for it. Recently on our visit to the Amalfi Coast I decided to face my fear of giving up control of my fate to another, by renting a vespa and hitting the open road in Italy! The Amalfi Coast is without a doubt the most stunning area I have visited in Italy (having previously visited Rome, Florence, Venice, Milan, Pisa, Verona, Lake Como and a few others) and for sure this is the best way to see the coast. So here’s what happened when we rented a vespa to explore the Amafi Coast! For this trip I partnered up with Southern Cross Travel Insurance to share with readers my experience with trying new things abroad. I’m a huge advocate of travel insurance and have never travelled without it myself, proving to be a good move on a number of occasions where I have been left with huge hospital bills from falling ill or injured overseas… as well as a few flight cancellations to throw into the mix! So for our trip we decided to visit the hot spots of the Amalfi Coast: Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Positano, Amalfi, and Ravello. These are the most popular pitstops for visitors to the Amalfi Coast and having visited all of them, I would say that you can’t miss any of them – make sure you see them all!  We first arrived in Naples, the gateway to the Amalfi Coast and the end of our fast train from Milan (4.5 hours with stops in Bologna, Florence & Rome). I’ll be straight up about it: we only came to Naples for the pizza. Naples is the birthplace of pizza and we were quick to jump straight into our afternoon of taste testing. My favourite pizza we tried was a classic margarita at Da Michelle, the pizzeria where Julia Roberts over indulges in the film Eat, Pray, Love.  For our first couple of nights in the Amalfi Coast we stayed in Sorrento, one of the largest towns on the coast and a great place to base yourself when exploring the smaller towns/villages/islands on the coast. Another added bonus is that you’ll find an absolute mecca of great gelato here in Sorrento, as well as great “aubergine parmigiana” (eggplant parmigiana) – a personal favourite dish from the Campania region.  Next up we decided to visit Capri as a day trip from Sorrento. This is by far the most popular way to visit and see Capri, so prepare yourself for the crowds! Ideally we would have liked to stay a couple of nights on the island but we were so short on time that we settled for a day trip (20 minutes by ferry, one-way from Sorrento). Here we hired a vespa for 30 euros for a period of two hours (including gas). This was what made our day so enjoyable as we were able to visit remote parts of the island that are otherwise only visitable by car.  Positano is the true gem of the Amalfi Coast and it won’t take you long to realise that everyone around you seems to think so, too! The crowds only increase in the summer months, so I would suggest visiting in Spring as we did if you would like to have a more authentic experience. From here we rented a scooter for a couple of days to explore the entirety of the Amalfi Coast on our own time schedule and plans. There are buses that run from Positano to the smaller towns (Amalfi & Ravello) but you won’t have the freedom and experience of riding on a vespa!  Next up we visited Amalfi town on a day trip from Ravello – on our vespa of course! This town is distinctly different from Positano as it is located a little off the water and not on the cliff face like its more popular neighbour; Positano. Here we enjoyed a great lunch and gelato (we went back twice in the same day it was that good!) Prices are a little cheaper here than in Positano so we found it a great escape from the hype.  Onwards into the hills we journeyed to Ravello, an even smaller town than Amalfi but a completely different experience yet again. In Ravello you can enjoy an incredible view over the coast from high above, as well as relax away from the crowds and enjoy the spring blooms.  This trip was about facing one of my biggest fears. It is not so much heights or motorcycles, but more so giving up the reigns and putting my life in someone else’s’ hands. I was travelling through Italy with my boyfriend this month who just so happens to ride motorcycles back at home, so I was fairly confident that of the two of us he should be the one in control. It was such an unforgettable day and a true highlight of my travels to date. I would never travel without travel insurance and despite nothing going wrong on our trip, felt more confident knowing that if something did happen, we were both covered by SCTI. With so many travellers falling ill and being injured overseas, I just wouldn’t take the risk! See the full video of our trip below – I hope you enjoy!!      This trip was in collaboration with Southern Cross Travel Insurance. WOW Readers (Australia only) can enjoy 10% off their travel insurance using the code “WOW”."
31,"A medium-sized city just a 30-minute tram ride from The Hague, Delft is surely the most picturesque stop on any traveller’s Netherlands tour. Known for its blue and white ceramics and beautiful old town, Delft was my favourite find on this trip through the country and if I could change anything about my itinerary it would have been to spend at least one but preferably two nights here. If you find yourself in The Hague looking for a day trip or would prefer to base yourself in Delft to explore the region, here is a complete guide to Delft, Netherlands!  A city more than 750 years old, Delft was built around a canal known as Oude Delft (old Delft) and later many other canals were dug around the city to make Delft what it is today. In the Netherlands and beyond, Delft is most known for their blue and white ceramics known as “Delftware” (believe me, if you don’t know what they are yet, you will by the time you leave!) It is also my top choice for the prettiest city in the Netherlands, moreover one of my top picks for Europe as a whole (seriously, this place is a postcard waiting to happen!)  Arriving in Delft is by train, tram or car, depending on the rest of your itinerary in The Netherlands. For me, I chose to visit Delft as a day trip from the Hague as it was just a few minutes by train or a 30-minute tram ride from the city centre (I chose the latter so I could see more between the two cities). Given the compact size of the city and in particular, the old town where you are likely to spend your time, a day trip is plenty of time to discover the city of Delft. It is however the kind of place you could spend a few days wandering at leisure, trying out all the different cafes and bakeries, so it wouldn’t be a bad option to base yourself here to explore the region (and probably cheaper than The Hague). Nieuwe Kerk – Protestant place of worship houses the tomb of William of Orange. Oude Kerk – 13th Century Gothic-Protestant church with an impressive 9-tonne bell. Main Square – The liveliest part of town and a great chance to sample local produce.  The greatest joy of Delft is just to wander without rhyme or reason, popping in and out of little boutiques that take your interest! Here are a few of my favourites: Chocolaterie De Lelie – Hands down the best gelato in town (SO GOOD!) Ten to Three Bakery – The cutest bakery in town – great little people-watching spot, too! Vintage Island – Really cute vintage shop – full of day dresses for your Euro wardrobe.  There are a few ways to see the city and if you have more time to enjoy the city, I’d recommend trying all three. Seeing Delft from the water is a relaxing way to see the city, as well as getting a commentary on the history and happenings as you float along. Walking the city is by far the most popular choice as the city is mostly flat (like much of the Netherlands) and the only difficulty you will encounter is dodging bicycles who whizz past you! The final option is to join the Dutchies and grab a bicycle for yourself (and by grabbing one I mean renting one!) This is a great way to explore any Dutch city of town, but just remember to stay to your right, ring your bell when approaching pedestrians, and use your arm to signal a turn before it happens. Voila!  As you will soon see, the city of Delft takes a lot of pride in its Delftware and there are many shops selling various levels of quality for you to purchase and take home. If you’re a souvenir kind of person (me personally, I am not) then this would be a great keepsake to take home from your travels to remind you of the Netherlands.  You can see more of my adventures on Instagram."
32,"Over the last year being on pause, I’ve been thinking a lot about the places I’ve been, the cities I’ve lived in and the people I’ve encountered. That is, after all, the beauty of travel. For me it has never been about the act of travel in a doing sense – boarding a flight, packing a suitcase or preparing a list of places I want to see. For me, it has always been about connection. About chasing a feeling of discovery – through places, people, and challenging my own prejudices. So when I was asked to join the Helsinki Freedom campaign to share why I find freedom in Helsinki, I started to realise just how much this city has impacted me. I first discovered Helsinki around my seventeenth birthday when I travelled to Europe for the first time. I was visiting my cousin in Kiev, Ukraine, and we decided to make a bit of an adventure out of it. We met in Poland and made our way by train around Eastern Europe before finishing the trip at his home just outside the city of Kiev. And while I flew in and out of Helsinki as my gateway to Europe, I didn’t get to experience it. Fast forward a few years later and I properly visited Helsinki for the first time. I spent two nights here before venturing north to Lapland, Finland‘s famed winter destination for viewing the Northern lights. I figured I would just be in Helsinki for a couple of nights to get over my jet lag, but I ended up enjoying the city so much that I pledged to return if I ever got the chance later in life. You’ve probably already heard Finland has been named the happiest country in the world to live in. But did you know it has won the title three years in a row? And while I’m sure everyone can agree happiness is a subjective term we all identify with differently, for me happiness has always been freedom. On my next visit to Finland, I spent four days in the city. There was something so alluring that brought me back that I couldn’t explain. The air was crisp and the skies were a soft shade of blue, but it was deeper than that. Everyone I met seemed to be on their own frequency, co-existing in a city that never felt too busy or too forced. Everything just felt like it was in a constant state of flow. Since being asked to write about why I find freedom in Helsinki, I’ve come to a few conclusions. Firstly, I really love this city. Not only as a gateway to Europe but I could even imagine myself living here. And it took me writing about why I find freedom in Helsinki to discover why exactly. It is kind of crazy to think that a world exists where employees can choose their own working hours (and yes, you guessed it, in Finland you can!) It was only recently Finland passed a new Working Hours Act, which allows employees the freedom to choose their own working hours. You know that job you love but also love to hate? In Finland, that just doesn’t seem to be the case. Working overtime is unheard of in Finland as working hours are capped at the time you are contracted to work for. Too often people tell me they dislike their job or wish they did something they enjoy. As someone who has travelled almost non-stop for eight years, I can see why there is little appeal to only taking a few weeks off each year! But the freedom of Helsinki allows workers the flexibility to work hours that suit them, clock off on time and pursue other activities outside of work. I not only think this is important but integral to the “game of life” and enjoying every day of every year, rather than looking forward to time off work. As someone in their twenties, I’m always looking for new cities to live in or visit. And the cities I opt for most are those that make me feel inspired. In Helsinki, one of the main things I noticed was the support for young people in small businesses. These are often cafes, bespoke restaurants and one-off boutiques. And that is the ultimate freedom for me. Being able to pursue whatever dream you have and feel the support in doing so. A huge thanks to #helsinkifreedom together with #finlandworks and #myhelsinki. You can read more about the freedom stories of locals in Helsinki here. I am so grateful for being invited to write about my relationship with the city of Helsinki. I am so looking forward to being back in Finland when travel resumes!"
33,"Europe is a great destination for first time travellers. Especially if you are travelling solo for the first time, Europe is the perfect place to start. This part of the world offers new cultures, languages and cuisine at every border crossing. So, are you wondering where to go for your first time in Europe? We’ve got you covered! Some of these destinations you would have heard of before and some might be new to you. All of the cities listed are bucket list destinations for their own reason. Some offer more of a challenge, others are extremely comfortable to travel solo, even if this is your first trip alone. Over the last eight years travelling I have discovered more of Europe than any other continent. From as far West as Lisbon to as far East as Moscow, there are many more destinations in Europe beyond this list for first timers. Check out my guides for Northern Europe, Eastern Europe and Central Europe if you are looking for more off the beaten path destinations. If you are flying to Europe from Australia or the United States, chances are you will find London to be your cheapest option to fly into (or one of them). Although Brexit happened and the UK is no longer part of the EU, London is still a great city to start your explorations in Europe and as one of the most exciting cultural hubs in the world, cannot be missed. If this is your first visit to London I would recommend staying at least three nights to see all the city has to offer. Be sure not to miss iconic sites and attractions like Tower Bridge, Westminster and the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and the liveliness of Piccadilly Circus. Winter in London can be a little dreary in the weather department, though if you love cozy interiors there are some great bars and cafes to hide away from the rain. Some of my favourite bakeries are in London and if you have time to visit, I’m sure they will become yours too. Peggy Porschen in Belgravia is a sweet display of pink and more flowers than you’ve probably got in your garden at home! I’ve been to Paris more times than I can count but I will never forget my first time. Visiting Paris is every girl’s dream and it doesn’t disappoint. There are endless arrondissements to explore on foot, but my favourites by far are Montmartre, Le Marais and Saint Germain. I have visited Paris solo year after year and despite it being the city of love, it is a great city to enjoy on your own. If you are interested in Parisian culture, I cannot recommend highly enough taking part in a pastry class in Paris. This is a great way to learn how to make French desserts at home and take a new skill with you when you leave. Paris is just a 2.5 hour train ride from Paris or a short flight. When you factor in the time to get to the airport, check in, fly, disembark, collect bags and arrive in the city, it is a much better option to train between London and Paris. Despite the ease of travel, train travel is often more expensive than catching a quick flight to Paris. Airlines like Easy Jet and RyanAir travel between London airports and Paris airports many times a day so if you’re booking at least two months in advance, you will be able to score a really good deal. Just be sure to allow plenty of time to travel from the city to the airport as some of these budget airline airports are completely out of the city and can take up to two hours to transfer. There is a fast train between Paris and Amsterdam that will get you between the cities in under 3.5 hours. On an average week there are 31 trains travelling between the two cities, though if you would prefer to travel at a slower pace you can stop in Brussels to break up the journey. If time is on your side, you might even consider taking a few days to explore Belgium. My favourite cities are Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp. Now, more on Amsterdam! The capital of the Netherland’s is renowned for being a cultural hub – full of fun, fancy facades and 17th century architecture. At the outset Amsterdam is renowned for its canals, red light district and bicycle culture. But there is much more to the city the more you begin to explore the neighbourhoods outside of the cities canal belt. Amsterdam is also a great destination if you are travelling solo. There are oodles of AirBnB’s to choose from if you are looking for something more local or if you are on a budget this is a city that is almost made for backpackers. On the other end of the spectrum is one of my favourite design hotels in the world: The Pulitzer Amsterdam. Budget travellers might be instantly put off by the price of accommodation in Amsterdam however there is an oversupply of bars leading to cheap happy hours and a great range of cheap eats in Amsterdam if you know where to go. Some of my favourite vegan restaurants are also in Amsterdam… especially Vegan Junk Food! Berlin is an edgy city that never sits still. A popular choice for expats, If you take the direct Intercity link train between Amsterdam and Berlin, you can reach the German capital in just under 6.5 hours. Berlin is budget-friendly and there are many great free things to do in the city. Prenzlauerberg is one of my favourite cities to explore on foot and is also home to many of the best coffee shops in Berlin. Although in the same country, Munich is a fairly decent train journey from Berlin. The average train journey will take 7 hours and 15 minutes and the fastest is 6 hours and 15 minutes. You might choose to skip Munich and travel onwards to Prague or visit Prague first and Munich afterwards. Or, you might choose to explore the German countryside and stop at small towns along the way. Many travellers make Munich a stop on their journey for the famous yearly Oktoberfest (which actually takes place in September). Regardless of whether you make it to the festival or not, Munich has a huge beer hall year round that has a similar vibe, just with less costumes! So you’re wondering where to go for your first time in Europe? Prague is a favourite for many first time travellers to Europe thanks to its unique blend of architecture, vibrant night life and relative affordability. Over the past 5-10 years Prague has skyrocketed in popularity, so be sure to expect crowds and plenty of them. Prague is best enjoyed on foot, especially if this is your first time visiting the city. The Old Town is full of secret alleyways and nooks to explore, so be sure to ditch the map and stumble upon hidden treasures. The Jewish Quarter is a great area to begin exploring, with its endless supply of antique stores offering a peek into the past. The fastest and most comfortable way to travel between Prague and Vienna is by train. The Eurocity is the most efficient with a journey time of 4 hours and 25 minutes. This departs eight times a day and travels in both directions. Vienna is a beautiful city offering a history lesson in Imperialism. Be sure to take time out of each day to explore Vienna’s best coffee houses and experience life through the lens of time. These famous coffee houses have a rich history and were once the centre of academic thought in the age of enlightenment. Another must do in Vienna is to attend the Vienna State Opera House for an evening of entertainment. If you can’t manage to get seats, you can opt for cheap standing seats at the side door on the night. The opera house is also open during the day for day tours that last around 40 minutes in length and provide a decent history of the opera house as well as its many rooms. Budapest has long been considered Europe’s most underrated capital city but nowadays it is a must visit on European itineraries and as such, is incredibly popular. In around two hours you can reach Budapest by train from Vienna. Budapest is full of great experiences you will find nowhere else in Europe. Be sure to stop by the Szechenyi thermal baths for an insight into spa culture and public thermal bathing. From there, make your way to the top of Castle Hill for a view over the city and insight into its regal history. Fisherman’s Bastion is my favourite place to watch the sun set over the city. Read more: Budapest for first timers Krakow is one of the most beautiful cities in Poland. Despite its beauty, Krakow is also the point of entry to visit Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps which provide an horrific but realistic insight into Europe’s dark history during Nazi Germany reign. The journey from Budapest to Krakow is a reasonably long one, so you may choose to break up the train journey (8-10 hours) in Slovakia. Make your way by plane to Rome, Italy’s capital and the world’s eternal city. There is no place as mesmerising and completely surreal to visit as Rome. The Italian capital is full of hidden secrets, so be sure to allow at least a few days to explore the city on foot. There are some great rooftop terraces and bars to discover in Rome. The locals like to keep these places a secret so be sure to do your research in advance. If Italian pasta, pizza and la dolce vita sound like your kind of holiday, then you may wish to spend two weeks in Italy while you are here. If you are spending more time in Italy, be sure to discover Florence, Pisa, Venice and the Amalfi Coast. Some more countryside locations that are worthy of praise include San Gimignano in Tuscany, Lake Como in the Lakes District, Cinque Terre and my favourite Italian destination of all: Positano on the Amalfi Coast. Read more: The most instagrammable spots in Rome There are few cities as fun, vibrant and easy going as Barcelona. The capital of Catalonia, Barcelona has a reputation for being one of the prettiest cities and has a personality to match. If you’re a fan of architecture, be sure to take yourself on a self-guided tour of Gaudi architecture in Barcelona. From there, make your way to the cities’ vibrant neighbourhood El Born where you can mingle with the locals and practice bar hopping from one place to the next! The best way to arrive in Barcelona is by flight, with Ryan Air and Easy Jet offering cheap flights from various destinations in Europe. Last but not least… one of my favourite capital cities and still one of the most underrated: Lisbon! The capital city of Portugal has such a vibrant way of life, the food is exceptional and the seaside location isn’t too bad either! The summer (June, July, August) is the best time of year to explore and enjoy Lisbon. My favourite neighbourhood to stay in and explore the city is Alfama (check out AirBnB for some fun spots to stay if you want to experience the city like a local). Be sure to take a day trip to Sintra and Cascais, two beautiful small towns near to Lisbon that can be reached in a day. On your way make sure you stop by Belem for the world renowned Pastel de Nata (Portuguese egg custard tart)."
34,"I can’t recall the first time I heard of Positano, however I can recall the first time I ever laid eyes on this colourful, coastal paradise. Ever since seeing a postcard of Positano from a travelling friend, I saw myself jumping inside said postcard and this year, finally, I did just that. If you plan on visiting the jewel of the Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy, here is a quick guide to Positano to inspire your journey.  The first order of business will be to book a room in advance of your stay, as Positano is incredibly popular and rooms book well in advance for the summer season. Guests usually return year after year and book their stay up to 12 months in advance, so if you find yourself looking to visit from June-August then be sure to book ahead. For our Spring visit the town was busy during the day and quiet in the evenings, as the summer crowds were yet to arrive and thus room rates were lower than the high season. We checked in to the stunning, family-run, five star property; Le Sirenuse. This hotel has stayed within the same family since its inception and you will realise within a matter of minutes there is no property in the region of the Amalfi Coast that encapsulates the region quite as effortlessly.  Positano isn’t a destination where you come to see attractions so to speak, nor will you find much to do beyond wander at leisure, soak up the coastal atmosphere, taste the exuberant Campania palette (pizza features heavily), purchase unique, vibrant mosaics and tiles, and indulge your sweet tooth in lemon flavoured desserts. So long as you walk the streets without rhyme or reason, make your way down to the characteristic black pebble beach, take note of the six senses when indulging in local, fresh cuisine and go out of your way to seek the perfect view, then really you have “seen” Positano. The rest will follow suit.  Campania cuisine is rustic, hearty, and full of flavour. Being a coastal town, Positano features seafood heavily, though for vegetarians you really can’t go past the delightful melanzane alla parmigana (eggplant parmigana), a personal favourite of mine, or indulge in a fantastic pizza. Of course the best pizzas are still to be had in Naples, but the Amalfi Coast certainly comes close enough to some of the best pizza you will taste on your travels throughout Italy. The first restaurant I would recommend is also the first we visited, located right on the beach (immediately turn right as you pass through the two lion’s head statues); Le Tre Sorelle (The Three Sisters). Here is where you can enjoy traditional cuisine from the region and prices are surprisingly reasonable for the beachside location. The place really comes to life during the lunch rush (1-3pm) and late in the evenings. If you’re looking for something a little more swanky, then head over to Le Sirenuse Hotel and book yourself a table at Ristorante la Sponda; the hotel’s michelin star restaurant with service and food to match. Complete with fairy lighting, charming waiters and a menu to write home about, this is the perfect location for honeymooners and couple looking for a romantic night out. For a much more casual dining experience at lunch and in the evenings, you can’t go past La Tagliata for great food at incredibly reasonable prices. The views from this restaurant are impressive though with its popularity you should book in advance, particularly in the evenings.  Positano is a small beachside village quite literally built in to the cliff face. Thus you can expect plenty of stairs, steep inclines, and narrow streets that motorists share with pedestrians. The town is best seen on foot in order to really get a feel for the place, however if you plan to travel elsewhere in the Amalfi coast I would suggest either a scooter rental or public SITA bus as the easiest and most affordable ways to get around. There is also a “hop on hop off” bus that travels around the Amalfi for those who prefer to play up the tourist card, though if you feel confident on the roads we certainly found the most enjoyable mode of transport to be a day vespa rental, which gave us the freedom to explore on our own time and plans. Ferries are another popular way to see the Amalfi Coast, particularly if travelling to the isle of Capri. You can also reach Positano by ferry from Capri and Sorrento, however you will find limited services on offer outside of the summer season. "
35,"The Château de Chantilly is a fairytale castle located just outside of Paris and is a must if you want to escape the city for a little while. Here are just a few of the many reasons you should visit:  The castle looks as though it belongs in a fairytale with its magnificent French architectural design. The castle is nestled in the middle of a moat and is an emblem of French renaissance architecture.  The castle is home to the Musée Condé which proudly showcases the second largest collection of renaissance art in France after the Louvre. Decorated in plush reds, the museum is a lot less crowded than the Louvre but the collection of art is no less impressive. With works by Botticelli, Raphael and Van Dyck, this museum is sure to leave a lasting impact on all art lovers. (Photo by Sophie Lloyd found on Domaine de Chantilly)  The castle has become famous for the horse racing events it hosts throughout the year. The Chantilly racecourse is located on the borders of the Chantilly forest and offers a pretty phenomenal view towards the castle in the distance. Going to the races is always a much anticipated outing but even more so when the surroundings are as idyllic as this location.  The most notable horse races are held here including the Prix de Diane and the Prix du Jockey Club. If dates coincide, I would highly recommend reserving a ticket. It will be a day that remains etched in your memory for a long time.  The original castle was built in 1528 for the Constable Anne de Montmorency however what stands there today is not the same castle. It was destroyed during the French Revolution along with many other of France’s buildings but it was later rebuilt by Henri d’Orléans in 1875 in an attempt to mirror its former opulence.  It is often said that Chantilly cream was created in the kitchens at the Chantilly castle. As the legend goes, chef Vatel was to cater for a party which lasted two days however supplies started to dwindle so in order to make the cream go further he whipped it to create larger volumes of the ingredient. Myth or not, you simply must try Chantilly cream whilst there as it is the best you’ll ever eat. It’s whipped to perfection, sweetened and flavoured with vanilla to create a delicious and extravagant cream which can be ordered as a dish on its own.  The gardens were designed by the famed landscape architect le Nôtre, better known for designing the grounds at Versailles. They are said to be le Nôtre’s favourite gardens which is no surprise after wandering these vast and beautiful grounds. Spanning 115 hectares, the grounds offer diverse styles from classical French-styled gardens to Anglo-Chinese gardens and English gardens created over three centuries.  Located deeper into the gardens lies the hamlet of Chantilly which is made up of seven charming thatched cottages with modest exteriors but luxurious interiors. They were built in 1773 and were used as quiet and calm oasis to retreat after hunting and walking. Photography by Faye Bullock"
36," With cobblestone alleyways and pastel houses, Arles is one of the cutest towns in all of France (though lets be honest – there are a handful at least). As part of my 10 day cruise in the South of France I had the chance to visit this picturesque French town and spend a day exploring the winding streets. Our ship was docked on the river, allowing for comparable views to Vincent Van Gogh’s The Starry Night, which was indeed inspired by the same views when the artist once called Arles home.  Arles is located in the south-east of France in Provence. The best time of year to visit is May-September as the Spring months bring the region to life with sunflower fields, lavender fields and beautiful blooms in the cities of Provence. This is also the high season for Arles and Provence, so be sure to book ahead! The nearest airport is Marseilles, a 45 minute train or car journey.   Arles Ampitheatre Place du Forum Vincent Van Gogh Foundation  French Coffee Shop A casual and really popular little eatery with a great range of pastries to take away. 10 Rue de la République, 13200 Arles Le Criquet If flavour-rich Mediterranean food is on your mind, then look no further than this popular restaurant. 21 Rue Porte de Laure, 13200 Arles Chez Felix A petit restaurant with vegetarian and vegan options. 32bis Rond-Point des Arènes, 13200 Arles  The Provence region is one of the most popular Spring/Summer destinations in all of France, so there is plenty to see and do to keep one occupied in the countryside! Below are a few popular onward destinations to explore: Avignon – Larger city located on the Rhōne River with a lot of charm in the warmer months. Nimes – Nearby city and a former outpost for the Roman Empire. Aix-en-Provence – Picturesque town with an other-worldly charm. Gordes – The beautiful hillside village you’ve probably seen on a postcard or two! (pictured below)  I visited the city of Arles on a 7 day river cruise with Avalon Waterways. All opinions and photos are my own and I’d highly recommend taking the time to enjoy a river cruise for those preferring a more relaxed approach to visiting France! "
37,"As the summer makes a slow escape in Europe, the leaves begin to find their colours and the months of September, October & November make up fall/autumn in Europe. While the Mediterranean still enjoys warm temperatures, the ocean begins its rapid decline in temperature, as do the countries in central & eastern Europe. Meanwhile popular destination in the west continue to enjoy warm temperatures with a balmy breeze, making Autumn one of the best seasons to travel in to escape the crowds and still enjoy the weather.  The Swedish capital thrives at any time of year, but Autumn is a great chance to see the city in calmer crowds and enjoy lower hotel rates. Stockholm is by far one of my favourite cities in all of Europe, with its effortless Old Town that comes to life with autumn leaves (pictured above) and locals who enjoy the last of the sunshine before the cold weather kicks in. Be sure to visit Gamla Stan (Old Town); the Vasa Museum; Fotografskia and many more of the top things to do in Stockholm. After living in Berlin for a few months in Autumn, I have an understandably very fond memory of the city! While the skies begin to grey and by December light is low going into winter, Autumn itself can still be quite enjoyable for visitors. The autumn leaves begin to crawl their way across cities throughout the city, though if you’re looking for greenery the best suburb to stroll around is Prenzlauer Berg. Also be sure to see these 20 top attractions in Berlin and check out this Berlin on a budget guide if you’re strapped for cash. For more tips on Berlin, see our Berlin guides here. Paris is one of the few cities in the world that I will never tire of, regardless of the season. Before you go, you should be sure to read these books to inspire a trip to Paris and read up in order to make the most out of your trip (Paris is a big city, one should come prepared!) If you happen to be on a budget, there are many great free things to do in Paris which should also allow more budget to try the best sweets in Paris. If you find yourself with extra days to explore, check out the best day trips from Paris.  The Cotswolds are an area in England that appear to have quite literally been frozen in time. The gorgeous cottages and rolling hills make this an idyllic spot to spend a few days in the English countryside, though it can quite comfortably be done as a day trip from London. Seeing the Northern Lights is on many travellers’ bucket lists, but the reality is that you can never know whether you will or will not see them. The highest chances are in the winter months, though there are many sightings throughout Autumn as well, just be sure to spend a few days to a week here to heighten your chances! Snowdonia National Park is located in Northern Wales and a offers a great insight into the rugged wilderness of this small and unassuming country. If you fancy a day hike or wish to trek for a few days, this land is vast and incredibly remote, so you will feel as if you have the whole place to yourself (although it is quite popular among walkers!) Scotland is full of fantastic countryside to explore but one must have a starting point and Fort William is a great place to begin (especially for Harry Potter fans wishing to ride the Hogwarts Express).  You can’t come to Europe in Autumn and not visit Oktoberfest in Munich. That really would be plain blasphemy! Get yourself there to experience Bavarian culture, traditional dress, and of course the beer! Check out this guide to Oktoberfest for everything you need to know, like the fact that the festival actually takes place in September! The Eurochocolate Festival takes place annually in Perugia, central Italy. The festival quite literally takes over the city, happening across the city for a total of 9 days. For chocolate lovers, there could quite possibly be no better place to find yourself! Countries in Eastern Europe often get a bad wrap for their food offerings (traditionally carb-heavy dishes like dumplings and stews are staple recipes), but one shouldn’t jump to conclusions unless they’ve been to see (and taste) it first! The Lviv Cheese & Wine festival is your chance to sample Ukrainian food and culture as it is the countries’ leading food + wine festival, held annually in October."
38,"With its cultural and historical significance, it is little wonder the Kremlin is one of the most visited sights in Moscow. This UNESCO World Heritage sight has long been the centre-point for Russia’s most defining historical and political events, making it a must-visit stop for those interested in Russia’s long history and future.  Visiting the architectural complex and all of the sights inside can be a minefield of sorts, with so much to see and do! For those interested in maximising their experience, here is your ultimate guide to visiting the Kremlin, including all of the must-know information and the great sights inside the Kremlin walls! There are two entrances to the Kremlin, however neither of these are accessible from Red Square. The main entrance is located through the Kutafya tower and is where most visitors queue to enter. The second entrance is much less used, however can be found through the Alexandrovsky gardens. This second entrance is the quickest entrance to the Armoury chamber and the Diamond Fund. As the Kremlin is at the top of every visitor’s to-do list and is one of the most frequented attractions in Moscow, it is important to arrive early to avoid queues, or at the very least limit the time you spend in one! The Kremlin opens at 10am and the ticket office opens an hour earlier – this is by far the best time to arrive and enjoy the Kremlin with less queues and crowds inside.  The Kremlin may be geographically small, but it is condense and culturally enormous. I would recommend dedicating at least half a day to visiting the Kremlin, especially if you plan on entering the cathedrals and palaces inside.  You can buy tickets for the architectural complex of the Cathedral Square and the Armoury Chamber online for the same price (500RUB/$10 per person) and it is much quicker to purchase your tickets online. If you don’t, you’ll have to queue twice: once to purchase your tickets and once to go through security to enter the Kremlin. To save time on the day of your visit, be sure to purchase in advance! Don’t miss the Armoury Chamber and especially the Diamond Fund. The Diamond Fund is the collection of Russia’s state jewels. Inside you’ll see uncut diamonds, crown jewels, blocks of gold and the world’s largest sapphire. Equal in value to the Crown Jewels in London and Imperial Crown Jewels of Iran, it is a must visit in Moscow.  The Assumption Cathedral is the most important church in Russia. It is where the Russian emperors and tsars were crowned and is where and patriarchs are buried. It remains to this day the main cathedral in Russia, making it a priority for many people visiting.  With 21 bells and beautiful gold-adorned domes, this bell tower is a striking sight. For a long time it was the tallest building in Russia and remains the tallest in the Kremlin. The Grand Kremlin Palace was formerly the tsar’s residence and is now the residence of president of Russia. It is beautifully ornate on the outside, but even more impressive on the inside. It is not easy to visit, tours are hosted on the basis of an application from an organization, addressed to the Head of the Commandant’s service of the Federal Guard Service of the Russian Federation.  The Tsar Cannon forms part of the artillery collection in the Kremlin. Once located on Red Square, it now stands in Ivanovskaya Square in the Kremlin. Don’t miss the Tsar bell which is equally as imposing and symbolic. Opening hours:  The Kremlin is closed on Thursdays. It is open every day of the week except Thursdays from 10am to 6pm. The ticket office is open an hour earlier at 9am and closes at 4.30pm. Price for Tickets: 500 RUB"
39,"For just two weeks of the year, Paris comes to life in a wave of rich pink tones in the form of cherry blossoms and plenty of them. Travellers seeking cherry blossom season should visit Paris during April, though the exact dates are changeable year after year. Fortunately, I have found myself in Paris for two cherry blossom seasons, so I’m starting to build quite the collection of favourite spots to see these beautiful flowers come to bloom! Here are some of the best locations to see cherry blossoms in Paris.  We’ll start with a less obvious (and as such less crowded) cherry blossom location in Paris – the metro stop for Saint Paul in Le Marais, coincidentally one of my favourite ‘hoods to roam around in Paris! One of the metro exits will find you facing this view the minute you exit, so be sure to look up.  Throughout the Tuileries gardens opposite the Louvre you’ll find plenty of spring blooms to discover, but none more impressive than the deep pink tones of the blossoms in the garden. The Tuileries are best enjoyed on a weekday in the early morning, as it tends to be overly crowded on weekends (with Parisians and tourists alike) and becomes much more popular in the afternoon.  Of course the most famous and photographed location for cherry blossoms in Paris would have to be the Eiffel Tower and the Champs de Mars. These blossoms were quite early this year and had fallen before most others, so luckily I had seen them a couple of years earlier and snapped them then. Remember there is only a two week window to see the blooms, so it is a bit of a hit and miss!  Easily another one of Paris’ most popular cherry blossom locations is of course Notre Dame Cathedral. The best chance to photograph these blossoms is at first light, before the crowds of people arrive, though you’ll only have a 20-30 minute window before it packs with people! Sundays the gates open later and deter many visitors, making this a great day to visit these blooms.  Parc de Sceux Jardin des Plantes Petit Palais Shakespeare & Co.

This has been my preferred route for a few years now and gives me another excuse to stopover in HK, one of my favourite cities for a short stopover. Thanks to Cathay for including me in the #lifewelltravelled campaign."
40," Paris is sectioned into twenty arrondissements, also know as neighbourhoods. Each of these has their own unique appeal, but if you’re looking for the creme de la creme, check out the below: My favourite Hoods Le Marais – Currently my favourite neighbourhood to stay and play in for its’ effortlessly chic boutiques, an abundance of cafes and great cheap eats. Best enjoyed on a Saturday when the streets are packed with locals and a buzz fills the air. St Germain des Pres – The posh part of town and rightly so! Here you will find some of the most beautiful apartment architecture in the city and the ever fabulous Jardin du Luxembourg. There are loads of vintage shops in the area but expect to pay a premium; real estate is a little on the expensive side. Latin Quarter – The best area for cheap eats and a has a great early evening vibe. Conveniently located just next door to St Germain. Montmartre – Long the artist’s district, Montmartre offers the best panoramic view over the city and has retained much of its charm over the years. Some areas can be sketchy at night but I’ve personally never had any troubles when staying in the neighbourhood. The 1st – Home to the Louvre and many of the cities’ main attractions, this is a great neighbourhood to stay in if you’re looking to hit up all the tourist attractions. Apartment rentals in this area are cheap and plentiful, so be sure to consider this as an alternative to hotels if you’re looking to save some cash. Canal-Saint-Martin – Only recently have the canals caught my attention and I am so glad they did! This neighbourhood is great for an afternoon meander, especially if you like great pastries (head straight to Du Pain et Idees).

A visit to the gardens will take anywhere from a few hours to an entire day… there is much to discover! Read more: A Day trip to Versailles The Top 7 Day Trips from Paris"
41,"Eating a croissant in Paris is one of life’s great pleasures. Some might even say (myself included) that it is up there with graduating school forever, winning the lottery or a long shower after a camping trip. Yup, they are that good. When in Paris this year I set myself the task of eating my way around Paris’ best bakeries and patisseries in search of the best croissant in Paris. A task I was more than happy to undergo in the name of research marketing. So to save yourself the trouble (though really I’m sure you’d happily do the same), here are the winners of where you will find the best croissants in Paris!  There are actually awards for the best buttery croissants in Paris each year and for pastry chefs of Paris, it is kinda a big deal. With the list slightly changing each year and a few newcomers popping up on the scene, here are the best croissants in Paris right now:  96 rue de la Faisanderie, 75016 14 Rue Monge, 19 Rue Valette and 16 Rue des Petits Carreaux 134 rue de Turenne, 75003 and Yohann Gressent of Boulangerie-Pâtisserie Colbert, 49 rue de Houdan, 92330 (Sceaux) 60 rue de la Convention, 75015 and Nelly Julien of Douceurs et Traditions, 85 rue St Dominique, 75007 38 rue des Abbesses, 75018 and Benoît Castel of Liberté, 39 rue des Vinaigriers, 75010 88 rue Cambronne, 75015 Cover image by Faye Bullock for World of Wanderlust"
42,"Museums in Paris amount to a whopping 153 in total, with many more galleries and exhibitions, so it’s little wonder that the art scene can be overwhelming. There is a museum for every interest; a vampire museum, a taxidermy museum and one dedicated to the underground sewerage system. Quirky museums aside, Paris is home to one of the most competitive art collections in the world spanning every century and every movement. Here is a guide to the top museums categorised by Impressionism, Renaissance Art, Modern Art and Sculptures to help you to uncover your favourite artists and paintings in Paris.  The Musée de l’Orangerie is most famous for its large tableaux of Monet’s water lilies. There are rooms dedicated to these pieces where natural light pours in from the glass room highlighting how truly striking his paintings are. The museum is also home to an abundance of other impressionist painters such as Cezanne, Matisse and Modigliani.  A former train station, the Musée d’Orsay has since become one of the most famous museums in Paris. It houses a large collection of Impressionist painters such as Manet, Renoir, Pissarro and Caillebotte. There is nearly always a wonderful exhibition being showcased so check the website before you go and make sure to arrive early to beat the long queues. Don’t miss the grandfather clock on the upper level and the view of Paris through its hands. Other Impressionist museums include the Musée Marmottan-Monet, the Musée National Gustave Moreau and the Musée de la Vie Romantique.  The Louvre was once the palace and home to the French monarch but it has now become one of the most famous museums in the world, arguably housing the largest art collection in the world. Many flock here for the famous three: the Mona Lisa, the Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo but I would recommend getting lost in the sculpture halls or one of the Renaissance halls. It is intimidatingly big and would take countless visits to see every piece of art, therefore I would recommend visiting one section at a time so as not to overwhelm yourself.  Similar to the Eiffel Tower, the Grand Palais and the Petit Palais were built for the 1900 Universal Exposition to showcase the best of Paris at the time. The Petit Palais now houses a museum with a beautiful collection of French and Italian Renaissance art as well as sculptures and tapestries. If you’ve got time, have a pot of tea in the courtyard surrounded by the pretty gardens.  Edouard André, a banking heir, and Nélie Jacquemart, a celebrated painter, collected pieces of art from their travels around the world to fill their mansion. Their staggering collection of Italian Renaissance art, French art and Flemish art fills the museum and is now open to the public to view. (Photo by Recoura)  The Pompidou center is the biggest modern art museum in Paris and houses the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe with artists such as Kandinsky, Miro and Dali on show. The building itself has become an icon of modern architecture in the city with its glass material and exposed pipes snaking around the exterior of the building. (Photo by Rue Rodier)  The Palais de Tokyo is noticeably one of Paris’ coolest museums. It always holds thought provoking exhibitions, has a photo both in the entrance hall and also houses a fantastic restaurant which always receives rave reviews.  This museum is significantly smaller than the aforementioned Pompidou center but no less worth a visit. It showcases a competitive collection of contemporary and modern art and many works by Matisse, Klein and Braque. Don’t miss the masterpiece la Fée Electricité by Raoul Dufy which shows the history of invention, ideas and electricity over the centuries, photographed above.  The long anticipated Picasso museum finally opened its doors to the public in 2014 after a lengthy 5-year refurbishment. Art lovers rejoiced at the opening of this museum dedicated to the works of the great Spanish painter Pablo Picasso. The museum houses 500 of Picasso’s works, sculptures and pieces of modern art by additional artists.  A visit to this museum is a must, not only for the art but also for the building itself with its honey hued interior, marble columns and ornate staircase. Other modern art galleries include the Yvon Lambert gallery and the Fondation Cartier pour l’Art Contemporain.  The Rodin museum is a favourite for many and is the sculpture museum to visit in the city. Auguste Rodin’s sculptures are located both in the museum and dotted throughout the gardens, the most famous of which is le Penseur, photographed above.  The Carnavelt museum tells the story of Paris, its history, its citizens and its quirks. It does so through its old-worldly furnished rooms and objects on display which share fascinating tales of Parisian history in an eclectic way. Located in Le Marais district, Carnavalet is a great museum to combine with an afternoon stroll in one of Paris’ most happening neighbourhoods. Photography by Faye Bullock unless otherwise stated."
43,"This is my second visit to Lake Bled and I dare say it won’t be my last. As one of the most romantic lake towns you can visit in all of Europe, Lake Bled steals the heart of all who visit (myself included). I returned this time to discover more and discover the best-kept secrets of Lake Bled. From the best viewpoints to details many overlook, these are the secrets to make the most of your stay in Lake Bled. I didn’t visit Cafe Belvedere on my first visit to Lake Bled in 2015 because it is only open during the summer months. If you chance your visit over the warm season then be sure to stop by for one of the best sunset views of Bled Island. On my first visit to bled nearly five years ago I remember rummaging through fall leaves climbing a hill to reach a view of the lake. As it turns out, there is a clearly defined path offering just that. Mala Osojnica is a short 45 minute hike that will give you the best view over Lake Bled. Sunsets are beautiful up here but any time of day is equally as beautiful. When I first visited Lake Bled back in 2015 I was on a budget and as such stayed a decent walk away from the lake and its happenings. If budget is not an issue for you then you can get no better hotel view than that at Vila Bled. Many of the rooms face the lake and have complete views of Bled Island up close. If you can’t afford to stay then be sure to drop by the restaurant for dinner or Cafe Belvedere for the best sunset viewpoint. Although it looks great from afar, there is nothing that quite matches the view inside the restaurant at Lake Bled castle. The huge imposing windows frame lake bled below and make this one of the best views in Lake Bled. The prices are surprisingly reasonable considering the view (around 25 euros for a full lunch). One of my favourite discoveries on my visit to Bled was the incredibly delicious Bled Cake. In Australia we have something similar (named Vanilla Slice) and it is not difficult to see why Bled Cake has become a popular phenomenon. The cake features a pastry base, custard centre and creamy top. Order one to share or ask for the remainder to go (even for a sweet tooth like me, this was impossible to finish!) The beautiful island that lies in the middle of Lake Bled is home to Bled Church. It is worth a visit if this is your first time in Bled and best reached by renting a rowboat. If you climb the 99 stairs to the top you can ring the church bell yourself! Another must-see destination around Bled is Vintgar Gorge which can be reached in just 15 minutes from Bled. During the summer months, Vintgar Gorge opens at 7:00 am in the morning. Unless you arrive five minutes before opening time, you will have to share the gorge with many other visitors. Guarantee your serene moment alone by arriving just before opening time. The price to enter is 10 euros with a cheeky additional 5 euros for parking. You will only need an hour to visit. Last but not least: an important note on the time of year to visit Lake Bled. Although you can visit the lake any time of year, activities and offerings are limited per season. The best season to visit if you plan to make the most of lake activities and surrounds in summer. This is when you can rent kayaks, paddleboards, swim in the lake and enjoy all the cafes and restaurants. Off-season, the lake is beautiful in a layer of snow. However many of the cafes and restaurants will be closed during this time. Choose your season wisely!"
44,"My favourite season in Europe is just around the corner (Spring) and with it there come cherry blossoms, longer days, sun-kissed terracotta rooftops and undeniably the most romantic time to travel in Europe! As such I’ve compiled a list of the most romantic towns in Europe to visit and I promise you, they’re a fairytale waiting to come true!  This charming little bohemian town has become a staple in the central Europe itinerary, particularly when travelling between Prague and Vienna or Budapest. Located just a couple of hours South of Prague, you can reach Cesky easily by road for a day trip, but I promise you that one day will not be enough! The town really comes to life in the summertime when locals and visitors take to the Vltava River and float downstream. Summer crowds are entirely unavoidable, but if you visit in April or May you can often enjoy the place all to yourself, particularly when the day visitors have left for the early evening!  I’ll never forget my first glimpse of Hallstatt: covered in a layer of thick winter snow, the sun setting and covering the town in a haze of blue. This lakeside town in Austria has become incredibly famous for its’ sleepy reputation and postcard prettiness. Whether you visit in the colder months or through the summer, Hallstatt has an undeniable charm year-round.  The colourful cliffside of the Amalfi Coast is most highly celebrated in Positano. Steep on the cliffside overlooking the ocean, this happening little town is favored by visitors who flock to the black sand beach in the warmer months. If you happen to visit in April you will be rewarded with less visitors, slightly more choice for accommodation and eateries as the crowds are (slightly) fewer. Be sure to venture on towards Amalfi town and Ravello.  Situated on the edge of the lake of Annecy and surrounded by a stream of canals, Annecy is by far the most magical town I have visited in France. This little gem is best discovered in Spring when an abundance of flower boxes burst to life, adding to the charm of this incredible little town that truly requires at least two nights to stay and enjoy.  Bruges has long been one of my favourite small towns in Europe, ever since I visited seven years ago. Located in the very North of Belgium, this charming little town is best discovered in the warmer months, thanks to the reasonably unfortunate weather (grey skies, rain) throughout winter and shoulder seasons. Be sure to sample some of the local chocolates, beer, and of course the famous Belgian frites!  If an active escape is more your style, you can’t go past a winter visit to Zermatt, one of the world’s most sought-after skiing locations – you can even ski all the way over into Italy! If you chance your visit over the warmer months, there are still plenty of trails to walk, mountain-bike ride, or just drive through the countryside and take in the mountains.  Over on the East, my top pick for a romantic small town is Brasov, Romania. From here you can explore a wide range of castles, other small towns and of course, the endless countryside.  I’ve saved the best for last with my most recent discovery: Delft! Many visitors to the Netherlands will be lucky to venture outside of Amsterdam, but as soon as you do, you will be greatly rewarded! My favourite small town in this country is just a 20-minute tram ride from The Hague and features an enviable old town just waiting to be discovered. Over to you!

45,"Recently I shared with you all my favourite fairy tale towns in Europe and because there were so many great suggestions for a city-style post of the same kind, here we are again with my handpicked selection of the prettiest cities in Europe that still have that beautiful small-town feel. While I believe I could have gone on writing about my favourite cities in Europe forever (I’m only a few countries shy of visiting all of Europe), I think I’ve managed to finally narrow it down to the absolute prettiest cities in Europe and why you should visit them. And if you need more inspiration, check out my travels on Instagram. Although I visited Denmark in the grey blanket known as winter, I couldn’t have been more mesmerised by this sprawling city that still somehow felt like a quaint, charming little town in parts. Undoubtedly my favourite area in town is Nyhaven, the colourful seaside dock, lined with gorgeous cafes offering blankets and outdoor fires in the colder months. Read more: Copenhagen Bucket List: Everything you Must See and Do! With its iconic canals and picturesque tree-lined avenues, Amsterdam is a strong contender for the prettiest city in all of Europe. Popular year-round despite the cold winter temperatures, the city is a tourist mecca and especially hard to visit during the summer months. I’d recommend visiting in the shoulder season to avoid both the tourists and the crowds – however this city truly is beautiful no matter what time of year!

46,"For new travellers to Ireland the choice of cities and towns to explore can be overwhelming. There are endless options available to you and with limited time, it can be difficult to know where to choose. It took me my second visit to land in Wexford, Ireland. This is my second visit to Ireland and this time I chose to travel South. After spending a few days in Cork attending my friend’s wedding, I drove over to County Wexford for an experience by the sea. For my stay in Wexford I checked in to Monart Spa which is also affectionately known as The Monart. This five star luxury hotel has built a reputation for itself as being one of the finest spa experiences in Ireland. When I first visited Ireland some four or five years ago, I hadn’t then realised spa culture was so popular in Ireland. In Wexford and Kilkenny at least, spas are increasingly popular and in high demand. The Monart is the type of place you check in and don’t leave until you’re being forced out the door at check out. Everything you need is here – a casual cafe for lunch, bar for pre-dinner drinks and a fine dining restaurant for the evenings. There’s a fully equipped gym in the spa downstairs, which also boasts a seemingly endless maze of steam rooms, sauna, infrared rooms and a swimming pool. While checked in at the Monart I found it difficult to leave. There was one evening after dinner I had to force myself to walk around the countryside after over-indulging in a plate of six flavours of ice cream. Around the Monart the countryside in Wexford is serene and quiet. There are many farms in the area, open fields and small country roads than seem to endlessly wind their way in every direction. Almost the minute I arrived in Wexford I was off on a sea cave kayaking adventure. It was a sunny Sunday afternoon where the sun was shining and even during the summer months in Ireland, you can never take clear skies for granted. With the coastal location of Wexford, you can’t pass up the opportunity to get out on the water. Even in summer the water is fairly cold and jelly fish are rife so the best option is to get on a kayak if you’re looking for a unique adventure. The tour was three hours in length, pretty easy (especially if you’ve kayaked before) and costs €54.99 for a single kayak or €99.99 for a double. While in Wexford for a few days I spent most of my time at The Monart enjoying the grounds, spa, and typical Irish hospitality that is difficult to beat. There is however more to see in Wexford and if you prefer to see the highlights, I can recommend the below: Selskar Abbey – Medieval ruins with daily tours Wexford Harbour – Beautiful harbour at the mouth of River Slaney Hook Lighthouse – The world’s oldest operational lighthouse  A very warm thank you to Visit Wexford for welcoming me to enjoy Wexford on this trip to Ireland."
47,"During my time in the Netherlands I had one wish: to see a castle. Whether it be from a train or in person, I didn’t mind. Oddly enough, I didn’t spot any castles by chance. So when I researched where to find the castles in the Netherlands I came across De Haar Castle. It is said to be the prettiest castle in the Netherlands and only a short drive away from a city I was visiting: Utrecht. So I set off for a day trip to De Haar Castle in the Netherlands. I had only two nights in Utrecht so I first made sure I saw everything I wanted to see in the city, then made plans to visit the castle. Given that the public bus to and from the castle took one hour each way and Google maps suggested bike riding would be slightly less than that (47 minutes), I rented a bike for €8 and went on my merry way to the castle. As it would turn out, the 47 minutes soon turned in to 90 as I mistakenly made wrong turns, was led to locked gates, and finally found a local village person to ask for directions. The castle closes at 5:00 pm and I arrived at 4:15 pm, so I was somewhat unsurprised to learn that I could no longer enter the castle itself, only being allowed access to the grounds (which was still so worth it!) On my way to the castle, I got lost inside the Village of Haarzuilens, built at the turn of the 19th century after a fire swept through the castle. The village itself is enough of an attraction – built in the same style of the castle with red and white stripes at every turn. I would highly recommend visiting the village after the castle (there’s a great pub/eatery in the centre of “town”).  Given that my entry was restricted to the gardens and I was still on a time limit, I found myself prancing around the grounds in a half-sprint, half-dance, too happy to care that it was raining with gloomy skies. I know, I know, castles aren’t that exciting to Europeans, but for an Australian who lives on an island, I was in heaven!  If you’re smarter than me (not difficult) and arrive prior to the closing time, be sure to buy a ticket to enter the castle and learn about its history. Entrance to the gardens was €5 versus entry to the castle and gardens for €10. I’d allow at least 2 hours to enjoy the castle and grounds, as well as another hour to explore the nearby village. Bike riding was by no means a bad idea (it took me precisely 47 minutes to cycle back to Utrecht), but may not be the best idea I’ve ever had when it starts pouring down with rain. The alternative would be the public bus or to drive – both options that will keep you dry (and prevent getting lost – which isn’t as good a story now, is it?)  Thanks to Visit Utrecht for welcoming me to the city!"

49,"For the past few years I have been triple taste-testing patisseries, bakeries, ice creameries and dessert havens in the city of Paris. France is of course the home to pastry and Paris is the jewel in its crown. As someone who solemnly believes that food cures and conquers all, I’ve put together a list of the most delightful sweet stores you will find in Paris so that if you’re anything like me, you’ll be inspired to frolic around the city ticking each one off like a check list you know you were born to complete. So here it is… the ultimate sweets tour of Paris!    30, rue Fontaine (9e) This bakery is quintessential “old Paris” – complete with an old cash register, a charming owner of 40 years (Denise) and some of the most gorgeous packaged sweeties you will find in the city. Best For: Gifts for home in quaint little jars and containers. 226, rue des Pyrenees (20e) An unassuming little bakery well in to the residential neighbourhood of the 20e, where classic French pastries waft through the entrance and lure you in to the pastry heaven that awaits! Best For: The baguettes here are top knotch.  33-35, rue de Faubourg Montmartre (9e) With multiple locations in Paris, this beautiful little chocolaterie has really made a name for itself in Paris. Known mostly only to locals, you know you will not be disappointed by putting yourself in to the hands of the shopkeeper who will guide you through the flavours that are always in abundance. They’ve got great macarons, too! Best For: chocolates – lots of them. www.lameredefamille.com 16, rue Ste Anne If French fusion food is your thing then you’ll have a great ol’ time at Aki Boulanger, who use matcha green tea in a variety of their pastries, using their Japanese influence to create beautiful, one-of-a-kind pastries. Best For: Pastries! I’d skip the bread here as you will find much better elsewhere. www.akiboulanger.com  226, rue de Rivoli (1er) If you’ve ever been to Paris before then you would have at least heard of Angelina (or if you’re like me, have been there more times than you can count!) Despite attracting tourists by the truck load, Angelina is a glorious tea house that was once frequented by the like of Audrey Hepburnin its golden days, and is still considered one of the trendiest spots to slowly sip your tea (or hot chocolate for me) amongst the chandeliers, hand-painted wall decor and gorgeous fine china. Best For: Afternoon tea – pastries and hot chocolates are the winners! www.angelina.com 23, rue Rambuteau (4e) In need of a non-Frenchie sugar hit? For cupcakes and cheesecakes galore, expats of Paris know to head directly to Berko. I would advise getting here before noon as in the afternoons they are known for selling out (not hard to see why). Great flavours and oodles of frosting. Best for: Cupcakes & Cheesecakes www.berko.fr  29-31, rue Saint-Louis en I’île (4e) Two words: ice cream. Four words: the best in Paris. You won’t find any other recommendations on this list because in truth, there is nowhere better in Paris for luxurious, indulgent ice creams and sorbets with classic and inventive flavours. The area is worthy of an hour out of your day, just to stroll and enjoy the atmosphere of old Paris. Best for: Ice cream of course! www.berthillon.fr 7, rue Antoine Vollon (12e) Home to one of the flakiest croissants in Paris (so flaky that you can quite literally hear it as you bite in) for less than two euros. Yep, it is worth the walk. Best for: Croissants 155, Boulevard Saint-Germain Another patisserie in Paris I adore and have full faith you will too, is Cafe Pouchkine. Don’t be fooled by the finesse of these pastries – the owners are in fact Russia and the store’s roots lie in Moscow. Bringing a little over-the-top Russian glamour to the Paris pastry scene, this is a stop that cannot be missed for any pastry lover. Best for: Beautiful interior and beautifully placed pastries  25, Place des Vosges (4e) If I could pick just one sweets spot in Paris to recommend you stop at, Carette would be it. Although their first location is more appropriate for tourists (a stone’s throw from the Eiffel Tower), their second location opposite Place des Vosges is by far my preference out of the two. The glorious square public square sitting opposite Carette is the perfect place to sit with your treats and let time pass you by (if you ask me, it is the prettiest public square in Paris). Best For: Macarons and delicate pastries (I hear the coffee is pretty good too) www.carette-paris.fr 51, rue Censier (5e) Although a little out of the way, that is all part of the charm behind Carl Marletti – arguably the best French patisserie in Paris and thankfully, one of Paris’ best kept secrets! Best For: Fine pastries www.carlmarletti.com  34, rue Yves Toudic (10e) If you’re looking for the best croissant in Paris then look no further – no one beats Du Pain. This small bakery in the 10th arrondissement focuses on doing a few things and doing them really well. Be prepared to queue – this is one of the hottest spots in town! Best for: The best croissant in Paris 33, rue Danielle Casanova (1er) With multiple locations throughout Paris, Eric Kayser is a household name in Paris. It is here where you will find gorgeous pastries, delicate desserts and delicious croissants. For a one stop shop, look no further. Best for: A little bit of everything! www.maison-kayser.com 133, rue de Turenne (3e) Chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate. Jacques Genin has an incredibly high reputation in Paris for being one of the cities’ best chocolatiers. Best for: Chocolate! 231, rue Saint-Honoré (1er) So… chocolate… got room for more? You’ll also find this chocolatier to be an exceptional choice, also having numerous locations throughout Paris. Best for: Chocolate! www.jphevin.com 93, rue de Longchamp (16e) A beautiful and delicate patisserie with pops of colour galore, you’ll find this to be an experience in itself. Although expensive, each pastry is entirely worth every bite! Best for: Pretty, delicate pastries in a beautiful store www.lapatisseriedesreves.com  21, rue Bonaparte (6e) 16, rue Royale (8e) 75, avenue des Champs-Élysées (8e) How could a sweets tour of Paris be complete without a visit to the world famous, deliciously delightful Ladurée! While the pastries are pretty and the tea setting quaint, the true winners here are the macarons! Best for: Macarons (classic flavours) www.laduree.com 10, rue Saint-Antoine (4e) Next on our sweets tour os Paris is an old classic. Lenotre is filled with delicate pastries in a range of colours and designs. Best for: Pastries www.lenotre.fr 35, rue du Dragon (6e) Located in one of my all-time favourite neighbourhoods in Paris, Saint Germain, Lili’s Brownies Cafe is a great little spot to sit back with a coffee and cake and not pay an arm + leg for it (unlike many other cafes in this pricey neighbourhood!) Best for: Cheap eats and delicious loaf cake!  72, rue Bonaparte (6e) With a handful of locations in Pairs and arguably the best macarons in the city (some say Pierre, some say Ladurée and many forget that Pierre once worked for Ladurée!) Pierre’s macarons are undeniably fantastic, however if you ask me you’ll get the best classic flavours at his main competitor (Ladurée) and the best fun, inventive flavours at Pierre’s. Best for: Macarons (of the adventurous kind!) www.pierreherme.com 35, rue Rambuteau If you’ve ever heard of praluline, the candied nut praline brioche, then look no further than a visit to Pralus. This baker is commended for his unique brioche, but also has a range of pastries and macarons for choice! Best for: Praluline! 30, rue Debelleyme (3e) For no-nonsense baked goods in a homely setting, head to Rose Bakery. There’s a full lunch menu available but if you’re a sweet tooth like me, you won’t be able to pass up the individual carrot cakes – to die for! Best for: Homely baked goods  56, boulevard de Port Royal (5e) With a handful of locations in Paris, Sadaharu Aoki has quickly built up an enviable reputation in Paris. Here you will find perhaps the most delicate pastries in all of Paris, with unique flavour combinations to keep visitors intirgued. Best for: Matcha flavoured pastries www.sadaharuaoki.com 22 Rue des Martyrs Rounding out our sweets tour of Paris is an old favourite. Located on one of the few streets in Paris that has been untouched by time and gentrification, Sébastien Gaudard’s patisserie is one to be celebrated (and visited frequently!) Although a little pricier than other patisseries in the neighbourhood leading to Montmartre, the pastries are also better than most – so entirely worth the price. The shopfront is gorgeous, too! Best for: Pastries and enviable location on the Rue des Martrys"
50,"The first time I visited Lake Bled was around five years ago in the winter time. It was cold and almost entirely abandoned. This year I returned for a summer visit to experience Lake Bled in all of its’ sunshine glory. I checked in to the glorious Vila Bled, one of the best hotels in Lake Bled, for a two night stay. Chances are if you are visiting Lake Bled you have seen one (or one thousand) photos of the beautiful Bled Island. The island can be reached by boat and if you don’t fancy paddling yourself there, you can pay someone to take you. Better yet – book a room at Vila Bled that gives you a complete view of the island any time of day. I checked in to room 106 and could enjoy the view all day every day during my stay in Lake Bled. The 31 rooms at Vila Bled are incredibly spacious – each with their own unique flair. You’ll find different furniture and antiques inside each room but every room promises one thing: space. Looking back on my photos during my stay, I didn’t take a single photo of the room interior! To be completely honest the beauty of this property is outdoors: in the manicured gardens, with the unhindered view of Bled Island, or enjoying an aperitif at the hotel cafe at sunset. On both nights during my stay I dined at the villa with a full three-course vegetarian menu. The restaurant menu is decidedly Slovenian, making this the perfect place to try local food. Many outside visitors who aren’t staying at the hotel make their way to Vila Bled for lunch or dinner and if you’re on a budget, this is a great way to experience the property without staying here. Outside guests can also enjoy the Cafe Belvedere which overlooks Bled Island from above. Everything I ate at the hotel restaurant during my stay was hearty, flavoursome and delicious. It was a great opportunity to try Slovenian food with a vegetarian twist. Each mea started with a hot soup, followed by a hearty main (usually a pasta, risotto or dumplings) and always finished with desert. The limoncello truffle dessert was an absolute heart stopper! I would return just for this dessert alone. Cafe Belvedere is Vila Bled’s best kept secret. It is open to outside guests, so even if you aren’t staying at the property be sure to drop by for a visit. You can enter from the lakeside and straight away you will be ascending the many stairs winding their way through the forest to the terrace. The terrace overlooks Bled Island and has one of the best sunset views in all of Lake Bled. The prices are really affordable and the cafe focuses solely on drinks and desserts (which is half the reason I love it so much!) If you try just one thing here, make sure it is Bled Cake. This deliciously calorific custard pastry is what dessert dreams are made of. "
51,"There’s something so serene about visiting a lake, especially when they’re as gorgeous as these top picks in Europe! From the gorgeous villas of Lake Como to the absolute serenity of Lake Saimaa in Finland, here are the most beautiful lakes you must visit in Europe!  The first time I saw Lake Como was from a taxi window. My boyfriend and I had just stepped off the train from Switzerland and could sense the change of pace immediately. No longer were we in sleepy villages, but instead experiencing the full vibrance of Italy – gelato, outgoing locals, and gorgeous little towns full of life! Lake Como was everything I had imagined and more – stunning lakeside villas, vibrant towns, and most important of all… exceptional gelato! Read more: A Quick Guide to Lake Como  I first visited Lake Bled on my year of solo travels, which began and ended in Europe. I had never previously visited Slovenia, but images online were the only convincing I needed to book a train there ASAP. Lake Bled is undeniably the most known lake in Slovenia, but you’ll also find many beautiful lesser-known lakes in the country. If there’s one country that will shock you with its dramatic scenery – this is it!  Lake Garda in Italy is another of Europe’s most beautiful lakes and a very well known destination in Italy. The distinct Italian architecture is evident everywhere you look, giving an immediate time-warp appeal to those travellers who like to feel like they’ve stepped back in time (you can count me as one of those!) If there were ever a town as pretty, charming and picturesque as Annecy, I’m yet to find it. This year I visited Annecy with my boyfriend and we both agreed it is the most beautiful town we have ever visited. Its just an added bonus that the town (and lake) exist in France – meaning outstanding food to enhance your visit even more! Read more: A Quick Guide to Annecy There’s probably no prettier lakeside village than Hallstatt. In fact, I’m sure of it. This gorgeous little village is commonly regarded as one of Austria’s best destinations to visit – both in the summer and winter town (a layer of snow on the rooftops adds to the romance!) Read More: Austria’s Best Kept Secret: Hallstatt When I visited Geneva a few years ago, I was surprised by how big a city it was. The best way to escape the city I found, was to head down to Lake Geneva (which is huge, by the way) and wander around the lake’s edge. Another stunner from Slovenia is the highly photographed Lake Bohinj. This lake is the largest lake in Slovenia, measuring a sizeable 318 hectares. The scenery around the lake is jaw-dropping to say the least so be sure to allow for a night or two to explore the area! The Obersee (meaning upper lake) is the larger of two parts that make up Lake Constance. Deep in the south of Germany and bordering Austria, this lake is undeniably one of Europe’s most beautiful. One of the most popular activities on the lake is to take a boat ride to see the beauty of the lake from the water – the surrounding scenery will astound you! As one of my personal favourites in all of Europe, Finland is absolutely full of natural beauty everywhere you look. Lake Saimaa in the southeast of Finland is one of the most beautiful places to find yourself in Autumn when the colours of the surrounding trees really come to life (though I’m sure it is beautiful any time of year!) Although not the prettiest lake in Europe, Loch Ness is a must-visit for any of those interested in visiting the legendary lake where the loch ness monster is said to reside! I found the boat cruise a real hoot on my travels through Scotland and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting! Visit my Instagram for more adventures in Europe!"
52,"Train rides in Europe are an essential part of the experience. You simply can’t come all the way to Europe and not embark on at least one train journey. So, what are the most memorable train journeys? We’ve listed our top picks, tried and tested, to help plan your adventure! Though this isn’t technically the name of the train (muggles call it the Jacobite Steam Train), I’d be doing myself and my fellow Harry fans a disservice by not giving credit where credit is due. The Hogwarts Express is one of the most sought after train journeys in Northern Scotland, running from Fort William to Mallaig. Journey time: 90 minutes Read more: On Board the Hogwarts Express Commonly regarded as one of the most scenic train rides the world over, for me there is nothing and no other train ride that compares with the Glacier Express in winter. This is one of Switzerland’s most popular routes (especially if you’re heading up the slopes for a ski) so be sure to book in advance! Journey time: seven hours Read more:  A guide to visiting Zermatt Ireland is a landscape photographer’s dream. The evergreen backdrops are so pretty you’d be forgiven for thinking they aren’t real and there are so many twists and turns in the countryside that the Irish countryside never gets old. One of the best ways to see the landscapes of Ireland is by train and there is none more luxurious than the Grand Hibernian by Belmond. Journey time: two nights Read more: 8 Places you must visit in Ireland The landscapes of Norway are so vast and ever changing that you can sometimes feel as if you’ve stepped inside another world. The Bergen Line is one of the best ways to see the country and our favourite pit stop is the quaint village of Flåm (pictured above). Journey time: nine hours Read more: Visiting the Norwegian Village of Flam London to Venice is a route not many of us would say no to, but it is the journey in between these two iconic cities that is where the adventure really lies. The Orient Express is one of the world’s most sought after train journeys and is known the world over for its’ glamour, sophistication and impeccable service (which of course will set you back a pretty penny!) Journey time: two days (one night) Moscow is just the beginning of your journey in to the depths of Russia’s far East when you board your train to Siberia. The Trans-Siberian is the longest railway in the entire world with connecting branches to China, North Korea and Mongolia. Journey time: up to seven days Norway is undeniably one of the most scenic countries on the planet and so it comes at little surprise to see the country listed twice on the list of the world’s most epic train journeys! The Rauma line is a great way to see the epic landscapes of the country. Journey time: 90 minutes Another winter wonderland favourite of many is the Bernina Express between Chur (Switzerland) and Tirano (Northern Italy). This journey is beautiful any time of year but we especially love it during winter and in Spring when the countryside comes back to life after the harsh winter. Journey time: four hours Read more: The best cities and towns to visit in Switzerland Despite being under an hour in duration, the train journey between Levanto and La Spezia is one of the most popular in all of Europe, thanks to its enviable location on the coastline of Italy.

53,"Naples (or Napoli to the Italians) is the birthplace of pizza. If you’re anything like me that gives you all the more reason to go out of your way to put Naples on your Italian itinerary… and that is precisely what I recently did. This year on our trip to Europe (I was travelling with my boyfriend and fellow pizza lover), we picked destinations purely on the basis of food or great views. We thus decided to visit Lake Como, onwards to Naples for pizza, the Amalfi Coast for incredible views, and finished our Italian adventures back up north in Milano for a mini city escape before travelling onwards to France. We arrived in Naples during the day and had one objective on our agenda: eat as much pizza as we could within the space of just two hours, before travelling onwards to Sorrento where we based ourselves for the first part of our Amalfi Coast adventure. Below you will find the absolute best pizzerias in Naples – no more, no less. We did a lot of research before the trip to ensure we covered only the best pizzerias in Naples, so below you will find a comprehensive list of our findings… happy pizza eating!  If you’ve ever seen the film Eat, Pray, Love, then you will fondly recall the moment Julia Roberts struggles to zip up her jeans after a carb-induced frenzy of food tasting around Italy (I know the feels and wholeheartedly believe a little weight gain is a small price to pay for the flavours on offer!) The pizzeria she eats at prior to this point in the film is Pizzeria da Michele, one of Naples most famous pizzas and home to a wetter, less crispy, more doughy type of pizza with plenty of toppings. You’ll pay just a few euros for a sit-down pizza in the casual surroundings. Drinks are of course available too if you wish to make a meal out of it.. but be prepared to wait at meal times! Location: Via Cesare Sersale, 1, 80139 Naples, Province of Naples, Italy (map).  If street food is your jam then you’ll find plenty of street pizza on offer in Naples. This diminishes the need to sit down and eat with cutlery (there’s no pizza cutting before serving here) and allow you to grab a pizza on the go to keep wandering the streets. Our favourite find for just 3.50 euros was this huge, delicious and bursting with flavour street pizza from Il Pizzaiolo del Presidente. The pizzeria was named after President Clinton, who visited the owner’s brothers store (Di Matteo – just a couple of stores down the street), which quickly brought a lot of success to the pizzeria and thus prompted the opening of the second store. You can also opt to dine in, but there’s plenty to see outdoors if you want to eat on the go. Location: Via dei Tribunali, 120-121, 80138 Naples, Province of Naples, Italy (map).  Of course it would make sense to name Di Matteo before his brother’s subsequent shop (above), but in all honesty we had a slightly more tasty pizza at the former with a richer sauce and generous but not overbearing portion of cheeses and oils. That being said, you can get a delicious (and deliciously cheap) street pizza here at Di Matteo, a great place to grab one on-the-go as you continue your stroll down Via dei Tribunali towards more (and more, and more, and more!!) pizzerias. Location: Via dei Tribunali, 94, 80138, Naples, Province of Naples, Italy (map).  As we were visiting Naples during a rather large travel day (from Lake Como in the North to Sorrento in the South), we didn’t have a whole lot of time to explore Naples beyond the main street between the train station and the town centre as we were mindful of the time to travel onwards to the Amalfi Coast. But if you have more time, you should try these also: Starita was chosen as the best on offer by the Serious Eats Guide, a guide that really helped with planning our pizza-eating-mission in Naples, so is certainly worth a visit if you have more time to explore in Naples. There’s also a little more to choose from on the menu beyond pizzas, so it is a great place to visit if your friend (whom you should question their friendship!?) doesn’t like pizza. Location: Via Materdei, 27, 80136 Naples, Province of Naples, Italy (map). Although not nearly the best pizza in Naples (light on toppings in particular), this is said to be Naples first pizzeria, so perhaps worth a look just as well. Location: Via Port’Alba, 18, 80134 Naples, Italy (map).  Let me know in the comments below your feedback from your Naples pizza eating mission! Which were your faves?"
54,"There’s no recommendation like that of a friend. So when an old school friend told me I must visit Malta, that is what I did! And my favourite day in the country was a day trip to Gozo, a short boat ride from mainland Malta. Although I visited at the end of summer, the sun was scorching as the taxi driver translated the radio announcement to me: “the hottest day on record in a decade” he told me. Thank God, I thought to myself. So it isn’t just me… I’m not the only one melting into the abyss! We arrived at the bay area in Valletta and I almost threw myself into the shadiest seat on the boat, before the driver hit the engine and we made our way to Gozo.  The first thing to hit you in Valletta will be an overwhelming sense of wonder. Embrace it. The city is UNESCO World Heritage listed and presents one of the most awe-inspiring displays of architecture. I would go so far as to say it is one of Europe’s best secrets! The church facades, statues and polished marble are just the beginning of this fabulous city. But it doesn’t all come at once. This city seems to reveal itself in many layers, much like the history it possesses. Be sure to check out the impressive limestone display at the grand entrance of Valletta, before winding your way through the impressive streets that will have you walking through a real-life time machine.  Although I could have spent days if not weeks exploring Valletta, my task at hand was to visit Gozo. So after a brief look at Valletta, I was on my way. Because time was limited, I took a fast boat. There is also the option of a ferry but since time was not on my side, I went for the former. If you have more time, however, a ferry is cheaper. If opting for the ferry, be sure to do your research and plan the day ahead. Ferries do not depart from Valletta, so you will first need to take a bus to Ċirkewwa before hopping on board.  With just one day to explore Gozo myself, I jumped on board a 4WD tour of the island. This way I could pack in as much as possible.  From what I could understand (based purely on later research from my extreme intrigue by Malta), the country changed hands throughout history – from the Roman Empire to Byzantium to Arab rule – all of which have had a lasting impression on Malta and how it exists today. Given the island location between Northern Africa and Italy, it comes as no surprise that Malta was susceptible to pirate attacks and slavery, which was especially prominent throughout Gozo through the late 18th and early 19th century. Napoleon Bonaparte also had a short-lived reign in Gozo between 1798 and 1800, followed by a short period of autonomy before the British took control later in 1800 until 21 September 1964 when Malta gained its independence. With such an impressive history it is little wonder there are many historical buildings to see and explore in Gozo, though with the heat of the day I was glad we zipped by, enjoying the wind as it slapped me in the face from the lack of windows on the back of our truck. The salt flats were an interesting area to check out and quite expansive if you’re looking for a photo op!  Touristy as it is, you can’t come to Gozo and not visit the Blue Lagoon… especially if you’re visiting in summer or on the shoulder of it! Located just a few minutes from Gozo, the lagoon becomes a pop-up summer party of sorts, complete with bars, ice-cream boats, water slides and party music. This is a great way to unwind for the late afternoon and cool off after a day of adventuring.   I hope you enjoyed this guide to a day trip to Gozo in Malta! You can keep up with my adventures on Instagram."
55,"I know what you’re thinking… why in my right mind would I venture all the way to Iceland for just four days? Well, that is precisely what I did. My friend was having a milestone birthday and she lives in London. I told her to “pick anywhere in the world” that she really wanted to go and we’d dive headfirst into a whirlwind four-day trip. She chose a stopover in Iceland with an ongoing visit to New York City. If you too only have limited time off work, limited funds (this country is damn expensive) or just love the thrill of adrenaline, then here’s how much we packed into four days on the ground in Iceland.  First stop: Reykjavik. This is the capital of Iceland and the landing place for all international flights. Therefore you can’t miss it (and nor should you), this is a pretty cool city to explore for half a day or if you choose to base yourself here, there are plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars you should visit in the evenings when you’ve used up your daylight hours adventuring.  A short drive out of Reykjavik is one of Iceland’s main attractions: the Blue Lagoon. This is located really near to the airport, so if you’re short on time it would be a good idea to time your visit either the second you land or on your way back to the airport at the end of your trip. We arrived at precisely 4:00 am in the morning from Spain so this was not an option but hey, worth noting!  From Reykjavik, you have a few directions to take for exploring. Because we were most excited about the South West Coast, we chose to make this our first-day trip. Be sure to get a good night of sleep beforehand as there is a lot of driving on the agenda! If you’re using maps, the official point to enter is Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon. The lagoon sits on one side of the road (pictured above) and the beach on the other: win-win! It will take around 4.5 hours to drive between Reykjavik and Diamond Beach, one way and without stops. Thus if you are visiting Iceland for 7 days or more, I would recommend making a loop around the coastline of the country.  I’ve got to admit: visiting a plane wreckage that takes hours to hike to from the main road was not on the top of my agenda when visiting Iceland. However this was the one attraction my friend wanted to see and given it was her birthday, how could I say no!? I couldn’t believe how many people were making the one hour trek each way to the plane (doin’ it for the grams!), but this place was crawling with visitors. Once upon a time you could drive all the way to the plane, however with the number of people going off-road and impacting the landscape, you’ll now have to embark on the hour-long trek to the finish line. Keep in mind that the walk is completely exposed and the weather in Iceland is extremely changeable, so be sure to pack everything you need including a few extra layers for warmth.  Iceland is full of natural entertainment at every turn and although they are far from the only waterfalls to experience in Iceland, they’re two of the most popular and they’re a convenient 29 kilometres apart, so can be visited one after the other.  On our last day we drove the entirety of Iceland’s Golden Circle, which we were both surprised took no longer than 3.5 hours in driving time. While the drive itself was beautiful (especially through Þingvellir National Park), the geysers and Gullfoss waterfall weren’t nearly as impressive as the scenery on the South West Coast. Thus if you’re tossing up between the two, I’d personally recommend skipping the Golden Circle and spending more time on the rugged coastline.  Although four days isn’t nearly enough time to experience all that Iceland has to offer, I was so chuffed to have finally made it to this ethereal part of the world that feels more like a film set (think Walter Mitty) than real life. We spent a lot of our time driving between destinations along the coastline, but if I could do it again I wouldn’t change a thing. Our daily road trip adventures were half the beauty of this country: open roads, no traffic, and incredible scenery even on a cloudy day. You can keep up with my adventures on Instagram!  I hope you enjoy your stopover in Iceland! What were your thoughts and favourite places? I’d love to know in the comments below!"
56,"A trip to Europe almost never consists of staying within one countries’ borders. Europe is a fascinating region with so much to offer at every turn, so be sure to do your research and pick your destinations carefully as there is so much to see in Europe no matter how long you intend your visit to be! Below you will find a full guide to transport in Europe, including which countries are best to travel on train routes, which destinations are better reached by car or public bus, and which destinations require flights. Happy travels!  For sure the most popular way to travel through Europe and in my opinion the most enjoyable, train travel is a great way to see the countryside of Europe without the hassle of navigating for yourself. However not all of Europe is well connected by trains or at least not all of Europe offers the most reliable services. In Western Europe, you can travel to nearly every single destination (even small towns) by train. This makes it very feasible to purchase a train pass, such as a Eurail global pass if travelling across a number of countries at a fast pace or regional passes like the Benelux pass to travel between Belgium, Holland & Luxembourg. In central Europe, the trains are still very reliable, plentiful, clean and efficient. Cities like Prague, Vienna, Bratizlava & Budapest are extremely well connected with plenty of departures each day, however if you would like to visit smaller towns like Hallstatt in Austria you will need to be prepared for quite a few train changes! Alternatively, consider one of the below modes of transport for travel days like these. In Eastern Europe train travel becomes a little more difficult. One of my biggest mistakes on my first trip to Eastern Europe was thinking that it would be as well connected as the West, even going so far as to pin point two cities on the map and assume there would be a train between the two. Time wasn’t an issue so I was prepared to take an overnight train, however no such train existed on many of the routes I had planned (rookie error, yes!) Be sure to do your research in advance and be prepared for changes in Eastern Europe – delays, cancellations and poor weather conditions are much more common generally speaking.  Although my least favourite way to get around Europe (you don’t see nearly as much from a plane window as you do on the train), air travel is still often necessary in Europe and sometimes a better option. For example if you intend to visit Ireland, better to book a cheap flight with Aer Lingus from one of their connecting cities in Europe than to get stuck paying for a premium airline on the same route. If you’re looking to save money on airfares that can’t be avoided, below is a comprehensive list of Europe’s budget airlines: Read more: Hacks to save money on travel in Europe // The cheapest cities in Europe to fly in to  After trains and planes, the next most popular mode of transport in Europe is buses. Although I much prefer trains (they get you there faster and are a smoother ride), sometimes it is nice to take it slow, much cheaper, and even sometimes a necessity. If you’re on a budget you really can’t beat bus travel. For a few euros you’ll find yourself hopping from A to B and the further East you travel, the further your pennies will take you. When I was travelling in Romania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia and across borders in central Europe, more often than not it was a necessity to travel by bus. Many countries in the East of Europe do not have extensive train services as is so common in the West, so more often than not you will find yourself looking out a bus window on journeys that can last up to 10 hours or even more! To see what buses are available for your routes, I would highly recommend checking out the Eurolines website as it is one of the easier to use websites for searching bus travel in Europe.  One of the more expensive options that does have an added benefit of providing more freedom and flexibility is to hire a car in Europe. The cost of car hire in Europe varies widely, depending on the country you are visiting and your age will also play a factor. When I hired a car in Ireland I was almost denied due to my age (car insurance in Ireland comes with a high excess and is incredibly expensive), though age didn’t play a factor at all when hiring a car in Portugal, so be sure to do your research in advance to determine whether or not you will be able to rely on a car rental. In terms of expense, car hire in France is one of the most expensive in Europe, however just across the (virtually non-existent) border in Germany car hire is much more reasonable and of course comes with the added benefit of driving on the Autobahn! Remember it is also possible to start your car hire in Germany at a lower fee and drive it through France, Italy and other surrounding countries, and bring it back to Germany without paying hefty fees for a French car rental. Also note that some companies allow you to drive point-to-point, leaving your car in a different city or even a different country after your journey.  Here’s something you probably haven’t considered before and bear with me a second, I promise it is not as elaborate as it sounds! Private drivers in Europe are a great way to travel between two destinations that aren’t linked by train or have shuttle services that don’t run in the winter. I first tried a private car service when travelling from Cesky Krumlov (Czech Republic) to Salzburg (Austria – pictured above) in the winter of 2012, when my shuttle bus service was cancelled last minute and I had booked (and paid) for a hotel in Salzburg the following evening. As it turned out I was able to stop over on the way to a small town in Austria that had long been on my bucket list (Hallstatt) at no extra cost, even though it was a little out of the way. Four years later a company has started up in Europe to cater to this increasingly popular demand of travellers trying to get from one destination to the next with stops in between, without the hassle of lugging themselves and their luggage off and back on to trains all day. DayTrip is affordable and comfortable, so we decided to use the service between Milan, Annecy and our countryside chateau in France as we really wanted to stop and see Annecy, though train connections would not have allowed enough time to stop along the way in just one day. The car journey took around 6 hours but we were able to stop at any point to take photos, grab a bite to eat, or just to stretch our legs. The driver picked us up from our hotel in Milan and dropped us off at our doorstep in France. Talk about service!  And finally you have sea travel by way of cruises (very popular in the Mediterranean throughout the year) and ferries (a great way to island hop in Greece, Italy and Spain). Cruises are available throughout the Mediterranean, Northern Europe, and even throughout Europe’s river network. River cruises with AmaWaterways have been incredibly popular of late, allowing travellers the ease of falling asleep in one destination and waking up in another! While cruises have been typically considered to be for older people, this is slightly changing as more and more young people see the benefit of a cruise: you check in once, you don’t have to change hotel rooms, you sleep and you arrive in a new city to explore. No time wasted travelling through the day, no hassle of unpacking and repacking, and if you snag a deal they are incredibly cheap! Ferries in the Mediterranean are incredibly popular and necessary, unless you are a gazillionaire and can afford a private jet (in which case, I’d still take the ferry!)

57,"Welcome to my Amsterdam photo diary. Sometimes I can’t put everything I felt into words and you know what they say – a picture tells a thousand words. Below you will find a selection of images that I believe showcase what Amsterdam is all about (through my eyes/lens). Beyond the canals, I have tried to capture the minor details which are often overlooked, the way of life in the Netherlands and of course, all of the food! Each image comes with a brief caption – often a description but sometimes a thought from that moment. I hope you enjoy!  Amsterdam via canal boat.  A walk through Jordaan.

58,"Knowing where to stay in a city and explore as diverse and as densely populated as Paris can be a minefield. So to help you make the most of your time in the city of love and lights, we’ve broken down the city by neighbourhood to showcase where is good for what, why, and most importantly… what you should eat there! Use this guide to help you navigate your way through the city that nowhere quite compares to and ensure you are always on the right side of town.  The first is the heart of Paris, and by reputation the most exclusive neighbourhood in the city. Staying in this area means you’ll be a stone’s throw away from all of the landmarks but you’ll also pay dearly for this luxury in hotels. Apartment rentals on the other hand are cheaper within this area, so be sure to check out what is on offer through Air BnB or a local site such as Paris Attitude. What to do: Visit the world famous the Louvre, be wowed by the stain glass windows at Saint Chappelle and meander the manicured Palais Royal gardens. Where to eat: Breakfast at the healthy epicerie Claus, lunch at Soufflé serving only the French specialty it is aptly named after and dinner at three Michelin-starred Le Meurice restaurant.  The second is trendy, bustling and brimming with shopping arcades and cafes. What to do: Peruse the quintessentially Parisian market street rue Montorgeuil and weave in and out of the old-world shopping arcades. Where to eat: Breakfast at speciality coffee shop Lockwood; lunch at Japanese favourite Hokkaido, and dinner at Frenchie, an on-point wine bar and eatery.  Trendy and up and coming, the third is an extension of the popular Marais neighbourhood – both a great area to stay and especially eat your way through the newly established eateries popping up in this part of town. What to do: Visit the recently renovated Picasso museum and peruse the goods at Merci. Where to eat: Breakfast at vegetarian favourite Café Pinson, lunch at Beaucoup, and dinner at clandestine eatery Derrière.  Home to the hip and happening Marais area, the famous Notre Dame cathedral and the idyllic Ile St Louis, the 4th neighbourhood isn’t a cheap area to stay in but it’s central, compact and has oodles of Parisian charm. What to do: Meander the cobbled backstreet of the Marais and all its vintage stores, take in the gothic architectural gems such as the Hôtel de Ville and Notre Dame and visit the former home of Victor Hugo. Where to eat: Breakfast at typically French Au Petit Fer à Cheval, lunch at falafel expert l’As du Falafel and dinner at the chic Parisian restautant Chez Julien featured in episodes of Gossip Girl. Known as the intellectual district, teeming with students and thinkers who frequent the historic university la Sorbonne. The 5th is a good place to stay with its mazelike back streets and abundance of eateries. What to do: Visit the historic pantheon, climb to the top of Jean Nouvel’s architectural masterpiece the Institut du Monde Arabe, have mint tea in the mosque and walk through the picturesque Jardin des Plantes. Where to eat: Breakfast at the trendy Strada Café, Moroccan feast for lunch at the Mosque and dinner at Bodega Tapas.  Undeniably charming, the 6th is an ideal neighbourhood to base yourself as it’s a beautiful area in its own right and also within walking distance of the Seine and many of Paris’ landmarks. What to do: Stroll through the scenic Jardin du Luxembourg, explore the areas St Germain and St Sulpice and uncover all of the hidden charms and back streets in this quintessentially Parisian area. Where to eat: Breakfast at fun and funky Colorova, lunch at traditional Café de Flore and dinner at expensive but worth every penny Relais Odéon. The 7th arrondissement is home to the iconic Iron Lady and consequently receives a lot of hype. Its proximity to the Eiffel Tower doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s the best area to stay in however, as restaurants, cafes and bars feel sparser than in other neighbourhoods. What to do: Climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, visit Napoleon’s tomb at Invalides, get your Impressionist art fix at the Musée d’Orsay Where to eat: Breakfast at trendy Coutume cafe, lunch at traditionally French Cafe Constant and dinner at nouveau cuisine restaurant L’Arpège.  The 8th arrondissement is a shopaholics dream with the famous shopping avenue, the Champs-Elysees running through it as well as the very chic and equally expensive avenue Montaigne. Shopping in this area costs a small fortune as does staying in it. What to do: See which exhibition is taking place at the Grand Palais as it’s nearly always incredible, traverse Pont Alexandre III and have a picnic in the gold gated Parc Monceau. Where to eat: Patisserie-laden breakfast at Ladurée Royale, lunch at Japanese haunt Taisho Ken and dinner at Michelin-starred Pierre Gagnaire.  The 9th is a large, bustling area teeming with great bars, cafes and restaurants and is the neighbourhood where all of the cool crowds flock, especially come the weekends. It’s a great location to base yourself, if speciality coffee and mixologist cocktails are your thing. What to do: shopping in the famous department store Lafayette, watch a performance at the gold-adorned Opera Garnier, explore St Georges and meander along rue des Martyrs. Where to eat: Breakfast at Café Marlette, lunch at trendy Buvette and dinner at tapas bar Artisan.  The 10th is the hippest area in Paris. There are some very cool places to hang out but also some rougher ones. Be careful if choosing to stay here as some parts can be quite hairy. What to do: Stroll along Canal St Martin and explore the speciality coffee shops around the metro Jacques Bonsergent. Where to eat: Breakfast at Aussie favourite Holybelly, lunch at la Chambre aux Oiseaux and dinner at Caribbean-inspired le Comptoir General.  One of the liveliest areas of the city with an abundance of bars and a buzzing nightlife. This area is fun and full of youngsters but also has some sketchier pockets. What to do: Bastille market and explore the bustling streets around Oberkampf. Where to eat: Breakfast at Steel cyclewear & coffee shop, lunch at sought-after Septime and dinner at Italian star Ober Mama.  Affordable and well-connected to more central areas, the 12th is a good option for those on a  budget. What to do: Stroll the charming, pastel-hued street Rue Crémieux, walk the Promenade Plantée, watch an art house film at la Cinematheque Francaise and visit the Musée des Arts Forains. Where to eat: Lunch at French classic Amarante and dinner at pizzeria Pink Flamingo.  A cosmopolitan area of town with a selection of reasonably priced eateries from around the world, including Chinese, Cambodian and other predominantly Asian cuisines. What to do: Visit the Francois Mitterand library and meander down the charming road Buttes aux Cailles with its host of restaurants, bar and cafes. Where to eat: Lunch at Vietnamese Pho 14 and dinner at South East Asian Lao Lane Xang 2.  These neighbourhoods are more residential with little else to do. There is however something to be said for their quiet and safe streets which provide a tranquil place to rest your weary head. What to do: Visit the underground caverns of skeletons at the Catamombs and get your fresh fruit and veg from the Raspail market. Where to eat: Flawless coffee for breakfast at Hexagone café, lunch at seafood restaurant Axuria and dinner at a cabaret show at Fracasse.  The largest arrondissement in Paris and one of the best to stay in. The side closer to central Paris is within easy walking distance of the Arc de Triomphe and a mere few strides away from the Eiffel Tower. The 16th is a beautiful neighbourhood of spacious and classically Parisian apartments housing wealthy families and chic couples. What to do: Peruse the Monet collection at the Musée Marmottan Monet, have a picnic at the beautiful Chateau de Bagatelle, cycle in Bois de Boulogne and get your modern art fix at the Palais du Tokyo. Where to eat: Breakfast at pretty Carette, lunch at former train station la Gare and dinner at haute cuisine restaurant Histoires.  The 17th passes from up-market to rough very quickly. The part towards Monceau is beautiful, Batignolles is lovely but St-Ouen is rough around the edges. What to do: relax in the gold-framed Monceau gardens and visit the Musée national Jean-Jacques Henner Where to eat: Breakfast at Pastelaria Belem, lunch at excellent Gare au Gorille and dinner at oyster specialist l’Huitrier.  Parts of the 18th are reminiscent of postcard Paris with charming steps and the iconic Sacré Coeur and others are havens for pick-pocketing among other crimes. Avoid Barbès-Rochechouart and Port de la Chapelle but don’t be put off by the up-and-coming corners. What to do: Climb to the top of Sacré Coeur and wander the backstreets dotted with artists at work and cafes. Where to eat: Breakfast at the brilliant Bal Café, lunch at New Yorkesque Barbès Brasserie and dinner with a view at the Terrass restaurant.  Not an area I would recommend staying in but one worth visiting especially for the Père Lachaise cemetery. What to do: Explore the diverse Buttes Chaumont gardens and find Oscar Wilde’s grave at Père Lachaise. Where to eat: Breakfast at Café Lomi, lunch at traditionally French le Baratin and dinner at hip hotel Mama Shelter."
59,"I didn’t fall in love with Helsinki on my first visit two years ago, but my second visit to the city has convinced me this city has much to offer for a 48-hour stopover. Flying to Europe with Finnair for the second time, I decided to spend two days in Helsinki before embarking on the rest of my European adventure. Not only did the cold force me to shake my jetlag, but it also made for quite the comedic day out with friends as we saw snow falling in Spring! Here’s how I spent 48 hours in Helsinki, one of the coldest capitals in Europe! Suuuuuper swanky and in the most beautiful part of town, Hotel Kamp has long been on my list of hotel stays. Its the kind of hotel that will make you feel like Kevin from Home and Alone, wandering the long, lush hallways and winding up in your super-luxe suite. There’s an indoor pool so pack your togs and be prepared to kick jet lag before you carry on on your adventure! Visiting Helsinki usually starts with the Helsinki Cathedral, located smack bang in the centre of town and offering great insight into architecture in Helsinki: imperial, imposing, and when you look closely, very intricate. I found the cathedral was best visited in the early hours of the morning, when the rest of the city was sleeping and you could enjoy the impressive church to yourself. Helsinki has a strong emerging coffee and cafe scene, so I didn’t waste any time testing them out! Scandinavia has built a really strong reputation for drip coffee, which is best found at Paulig Kulma and Fratello Torrefazione. Other great coffee shops in own include Johan & Nystrom (hipster haunt), Cafe Fazer (chocolate, chocolate, chocolate!!!) and Strindberg for great coffee in a casual setting.  The harbour of Helsinki is one of the cities’ most central points and places of business. Here you can visit the local markets, wandering along the waterfront or even take in the view from the ferris wheel.  Located down on the waterfront is one of my favourite finds from my second visit to Helsinki, that I somehow overlook on my first visit two years ago! Inside the market hall you will find a variety of local produce, farm to table products, local delicacies and some traditional giftware.  Not far from the waterfront is perhaps my favourite area of Helsinki to wander around: The Esplanade. This is where you will find the cities’ most luxurious hotel; Hotel Kamp. Nearby are a range of upmarket restaurants and cafes, as well as upscale boutiques both local and international. Kappeli is a great place to grab lunch, especially in the warmer months when you can enjoy the outdoor seating. Don’t forget to look up when walking through this part of town – the architecture is amazing! One experience you absolutely must have in Finland is to enjoy a traditional Finnish Sauna. Many of the hotels in the city will have a sauna for you to use, but if not check out Helsinki Day Spa for the full experience. The more traditional way to spa (found outside of the cities) is to follow a hot sauna with an ice cold plunge in the lake (have tried it once, will never again!)  After all your wandering, head to one of these great pastry shops for a sugary treat: Paulig Kulma, Fazer Cafe or the very cute Frangipani Bakery Boutique.  Another impressive church in Helsinki from the Orthodox faith is Uspenski Cathedral, located near to the harbour. The church was but in the mid-late 19th Century and is the largest orthodox church in Western Europe. As beautiful as Helsinki is, there’s an absolute gem of a city located just a two-hour ferry ride away. You guessed it: Tallinn, Estonia! Ferries run very frequently every day and it is a great way to spend 6-8 hours of your day in Tallinn, before returning to Helsinki in the late afternoon or early evening. Helsinki International Airport is located a 30 minute drive from the city. The most affordable and convenient way to the city is with one of the public buses or the Finnair city bus (both around the same price). The buses will drop you off in the centre of town at the main train station. For convenience I would recommend booking a hotel within the Kluuvi area, especially if you are only in town for a couple of days. Arriving early in Helsinki? There are luggage storage lockers below the main train station, costing 4-6 euros for 24 hours (depending on the size of the locker required). Catching the ferry is extremely simple and affordable. Purchasing a ticket at the ferry dock cost me 35 euros. To reach the port, it is around 20-30 minutes walk from the main train station. Finland is on the Euro and ATMs are widely available both at the airport and in the city centre. Most places will take card payment."
60,"Over on Ireland’s southwest Atlantic coast lies one of the best kept secrets in Ireland. Rugged coastlines, dramatic landscapes and a friendliness that could only belong to small town folk are all characteristics of the Dingle Peninsula. If you are looking for that real Irish experience filled with small towns, lively country pubs and endless adventures to be had on an extended road trip, Dingle is a great choice for your Irish adventures. You will need at least a few days to explore the Dingle Peninsula but if you’re making a trip all that way, you could easily fill 5-7 days in this rugged part of Ireland. Here is your complete guide to visiting the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland. When I first visited Ireland five years ago I had just one week to explore what I thought were the highlights of Ireland. I was in need of an Irish road trip adventure, so I flew to Dublin and followed the roads to wherever they took me. I had nothing booked – no plans, no hotels, no offline maps at the time (maybe they existed but by then I was still a purist). On that trip I ended up in random Bed and Breakfasts, asking locals for recommendations on what to do in the area and following an paper map to wherever sounded interesting by the name. I wound up on the west coast but much further North in Sligo, finally making my way down to Galway and back to Dublin. On that trip I fell in love with Ireland and vowed to return one day. It was more the journey itself that I loved – meeting locals, travelling without a plan and saying yes at every opportunity. When I saw photos of the Dingle Peninsula earlier this year I promised myself out loud that this would be the year I would return… and here I am in Dingle! If you are exploring the Dingle Peninsula there are many different accommodation types on offer, however most of them will be bed and breakfast guest houses in this part of the country. This is a great opportunity to arrive without plans, ask the locals for advice and follow it with flexibility as you will undeniably get side tracked on these winding scenic roads. Dingle (the town itself) is a great base if you would prefer a mix of city and country. I chose to base myself here so I was close to the small boutique shops and cafes, but only a few minutes drive to the countryside and coastline. The town is small but full of cafes, pubs and boutiques like hat stores, wool stores, and so on. The B&B I booked last minute was Barr Na Sraide Inn. Be careful if using maps to arrive as I did, because there is a tiny town also in Kerry by the same name. Save yourself 2 hours of driving and just get the locations to Dingle (the inn is located on the main strip). My room was around $200 AUD per night – not cheap but one of the more affordable options and it was really cosy. The buffet breakfast is an additional $10 but totally worth it for the unlimited coffee with a make-your-own yogurt parfait station that I definitely made sure I got my moneys worth! If you’re staying for a few days or more, you will have plenty of time to enjoy the town of Dingle in the evenings. There are endless choices for pubs, restaurants, cafes and even a gourmet supermarket! Here are my top picks, tried and tested: When I arrived in Dingle late in the evening after two hours of missed directions on top of a four hour drive from Dublin, there weren’t many options for dinner. The next day I decided to treat myself by finding the best cafe in town for a huge healthy lunch. Pantri is hands down the best cafe in town though sadly they close each day at 4:00pm so make sure you go for lunch. Dick Macks is one of the most loved pubs in all of county Kerry. It has a really lively atmosphere and is always full of locals, so this is a great place to go for your iconic Irish pub experience. I stumbled upon this boutique almost by accident but it was a fun place to discover nonetheless. The small boutique is home to hundreds if not thousands of hats of every variety. I have heard on more than one occasion Irish people say they would travel to Dingle just to get an ice cream from Murphy’s. This small ice creamery is so popular that not only do people travel to indulge, but it has also expanded to a shop in Dublin. Take my word for it – the flavours are incredible and you can tell a lot of thought goes in to making something worth travelling for. The Dingle Peninsula has a relaxed vibe indoors, but outside of the pubs and cosy cafes there is a ruggedness that calls on adventure travellers. If you’re looking for scenic spots, day hikes and great road trip ideas, see below: The iconic photo (above) is what drew me to Dingle in the first place. This narrow winding road is used as an access point to the Blasket Island Ferry. It is one of the most scenic points of interest on the peninsula. Out in the westernmost part of the Dingle Peninsula is Dunmore Head, one of the area’s most photogenic spots at sunset. For hiking enthusiasts, look no further than Mount Brandon. This is a great half day hike that will give you sweeping views over the peninsula and ocean. The hike is 9-15km depending on the length you choose and will take around 4-5 hours to complete. If you are more of a leisure enthusiast then sit back and drive yourself toward the Ring of Kerry, commonly regarded as one of Ireland’s most scenic drives."
61,"The Amalfi Coast has become one of Italy’s most popular tourist destinations over the past few years, though it has always been a popular choice for Italians venturing to the coast for the summer months. International visitors have swamped the likes of Positano and Capri, however there is much more to the Amalfi Coast beyond these two hot spots (scenic as they are), starting with one of our favourite spots: Ravello. Ravello is located on the top of a hill, overlooking the Amalfi Coast. While it may not have the added bonus of being a short walk to the beach, Ravello certainly holds some of the best views on the coast. So scenic in fact, that the town gained UNESCO World Heritage status in 1997. Because of its small nature, many travellers visit Ravello on a day trip from nearby towns like Positano or Sorrento. A great way to venture along the coast line and in to the hills is by vespa which can be rented from either of these towns. There are many things to see in Ravello but if you only have an afternoon to do so, it is possible to see everything in a few hours and catch a sunset atop the hill. Duomo di Ravello – located at the centre of Ravello facing the main square. Villa Rufolo – featuring an incredible garden with views that are hard to beat. Villa Cimbrone – a five star hotel that is commonly regarded as one of the most prestigious on the coastline. Babel wine bar – a great little wine bar with tapas style eats. L’antica Cartiera – an upscale restaurant with sweeping views of the Amalfi coast."
62,"Ever seen yourself on a sweet walking tour of Paris? I know I have — and you’re about to find out why you should too. This walking tour will guide you around the streets of Paris uncovering all of the city’s best pastry shops full of delicious treats and sweet etas. The aim of the tour is to give you insider knowledge into the best of Paris’ sweet scene with maximum dessert stops and minimum walking… because patience is non-existent when it comes to French pastries!  Let’s start our tour in the charming St Germain area, not only because it’s densely populated with Paris’ best pastry shops but also because its streets are as pretty as a postcard. The starting point of our tour will be the established chocolatier Pierre Marcolini. The heady smell of rich chocolate welcomes you through the entrance, stay for a while and buy a couple of divine chocolates or macarons to whet your appetite. 89 Rue de Seine, 75006 Paris, France Just opposite, a few strides away lies Gérard Mulot, a quintessentially Parisian pastry shop. Decide among their traditional French pastries such as Tarte au Citron, Millefeuille or Paris-Brest. 76 Rue de Seine, 75006 Paris, France Let’s take a little detour off Rue de Seine for a moment to discover Brigitte Bardot’s supposed favourite pastry originating from St Tropez. Fluffy brioche cake is filled with velvety cream to create the original Tarte Tropézienne. Grab a full-sized one or a mini one depending on your capacity, there are plenty more pastry stops to come. (Photo by Virginie) 3 Rue de Montfaucon, 75006 Paris Navigate your way back to the scenic Rue de Seine and you’ll arrive at the most authentic Italian gelateria on your left: Grom. Order among the classic flavours such as creamy pistachio, zingy lemon or nutty hazelnut. 81 Rue de Seine, 75006 Paris, France Carrying on down the same road, take a right and you’ll arrive at the quaint sweet shop Meert specialising in classic French waffles, originally from Lille. They also sell sweet cakes, fluffy marshmallows and caramels but really the thing to take away is their signature vanilla waffle. 3 Rue Jacques Callot, 75006 Paris, France We’ve now navigated our way down the length of Rue de Seine arriving close to the river. Now we’re going to work our way back up the parallel Rue Bonaparte. The first stop along this road is the much-celebrated Ladurée. Pop in for a few delicious macarons or a full-blown pastry if you’ve got room. 21 Rue Bonaparte, 75006 Paris, France Up for a fun little taste test? Save your recently purchased Ladurée macarons until you reach Pierre Hermé along the same road. The battle between which macaron reigns supreme has been a longstanding one and now it’s up to you to decide. If you’ve got room pick up one of Pierre Hermé’s inventive creations such as the Ispahan, Montebello or the Tarte Céleste. 72 Rue Bonaparte, 75006 Paris, France A few feet away lies one of the prettiest squares in Paris: Place St Sulpice. Chocolate connoisseur Patrick Roger’s store is also located on this square. Intricate chocolate sculptures are displayed in the window and lure chocoholics inside. Grab a couple of pralines, dark ganaches and caramels for the road. 2-4 Place Saint-Sulpice, 75006 Paris, France From one chocolate shop to another.

This Michelin-starred chef has now extended his talents to chocolate and the man can do no wrong. Choose among rich bars stuffed with salted caramel, pistachio or passion fruit and coconut. 26 Rue Saint-Benoît, 75006 Paris, France St Germain has recently been graced with the presence of a newly opened Café Pouchkine in the neighbourhood. This celebrated Franco-Russian pastry shop adds even more competition to the pastry scene in the area, with its sublime creations. Café Pouchkine’s tea room is the perfect place to end our pastry tour and peruse your paper bags full of sweet treats, if they haven’t all been consumed along the way. 155 Boulevard Saint-Germain, 75006 Paris"
63,"Hey friends! It has only been a few weeks since I landed back home from my annual trip to Paris. But it probably won’t come as a surprise to you that I’m already having withdrawals. Hence, this guide to the most instagrammable places in Paris! I’m curing my wanderlust just as much as yours here. On this trip to Paris I made a point of visiting as many new and undiscovered places as possible, skipping out the iconic monuments as much as possible (though a trip to Paris without taking in the view from the top of the Arc de Triomphe is hardly a trip to Paris at all!) I’ve put together a list of my favourite Instagrammable places in Paris, many of them hidden secrets and a few iconic gems you can’t miss out. Happy snapping!  Hidden away from the grand boulevards and streams of tourists are the most beautiful nostalgic passageways that will transport you back to the golden age of Paris. These hidden passages were mostly destroyed in the modernisation of Paris, however around 40 still remain and retain the beauty of Paris more than a century ago.  The 17th-century arcades and iconic striped columns have become a blogger’s favourite during fashion week, so be sure you stop by to see what all the fuss is about! Located a short walk from the Louvre, many visitors to Paris walk by the Palais Royal without even realising it is there. Get directions  Tucked away on a side street a few minutes walk from Notre Dame is my favourite Parisian cafe/restaurant in the Spring – Au Vieux Paris d’Arcole. You will often find the owners tucked away in a corner enjoying their very own cafe au lait or vino, so be sure to make yourself known on arrival with a friendly “Bonjour!” Get directions  Colourful and quirky, the Moulin Rouge isn’t nearly as glamorous as the film but still a sight worth seeing on your Parisian adventures. Located in one of my favourite neighbourhoods (Montmartre), the Moulin Rouge is still to this day the most famous cabaret in Paris. Not only is it one of the most instagrammable places in Paris but it is also one of the most fun ways to spend an evening. I’ve already been but I would go again!  Cheap eats and choices for days, the Latin Quarter is still my most favourite neighbourhood to meet friends and grab a bite in the early evening. There are oodles of cheap eats on offer from crepes to kebabs, all the way through to traditional Moroccan tagine. This colourful part of town is an instagram waiting to happen!  Not only is it the most delicious ice cream in all of Paris, but it is also a perfect Parisian postcard in the making! You’ll find Berthillon on Ile Saint Louis, one of the most quaint and charming islands to explore on the Seine. There’s always a queue in the spring/summer, but the drool-worthy flavours are worth the wait!  If you ask me the Arc De Triomphe is still the best view in all of Paris (coming in at a close second is Tour Montparnasse in my books). Despite having one of the best views in the city, the queue is never long in the morning and crowds are scarce, something you won’t be able to say for a trip up the Eiffel Tower! This view is one of the most instagrammable places in Paris because you can snap the Eiffel Tower in the background.  As one of my favourite neighbourhoods in Paris, I never can come to the city without a visit to Saint Germain. The cafe culture here is alive and kicking, with popular cafes such as Cafe de Flore and Les Deux Magots taking centre stage. Be sure to walk around the small alleyways to find hidden gems a little more under the radar and spend a long afternoon people watching in the summer sun.  As cliche as it may be, I can’t come to Paris without a re-visit to Angelina for a chocolat chaud and freshly baked croissant. This is one of Paris’ oldest institutions, once being a favourite for the likes of Coco Chanel and her fashionable counterparts. Although there are a number of locations now throughout Paris, the traditional teahouse on Rue de Rivoli is still the best.  …is a busy street! Although completely overrun by tourists and a nightmare to navigate through in traffic, there’s still a certain kind of magic on Paris’ busiest street. For me that magic lies at the end of the street, right in front of the beautiful Arc de Triomphe. Don’t miss the chance to pop in to Laduree for an afternoon sugar pick-me-up, even if it is the busiest location in the city!  Not so much a location but a time to visit, there is no better Paris than Paris in the Spring. Cherry blossoms bring the city in to full colour in April, which coincides with the beginning of tourist season in the city (though one could argue all seasons are tourist seasons in Paris!)  This cul de sac in the 16th arrondisement has one of the best views of the Eiffel Tower, so it comes at no surprise that this little hidden find has become one of the most instagrammable spots in Paris! You’ll find it a few minutes walk from the Trocadero, another favourite spot for instagrammers but always crowded with tourists.  This is hands down my most favourite cafe in all of Paris and the perfectly quintessential “Parisian cafe overlay” waiting to happen. There are two locations, though my favourite is by far the location opposite Place des Vosges in Le Marais. (Image by Faye Bullock for World of Wanderlust).  While you’re there, be sure to drop by Place des Vosges, arguably the prettiest public square in all of Paris. Le Marais is one of my favourite neighbourhoods to stay and wander around, offering one of the most authentic experiences in the city in the present day.  If you’re a fan of the film Amélie like me, you’ll fondly remember the skimming stones scene, located right here in Canal Saint Martin. This is hands down one of the most beautiful and underrated neighbourhoods in Paris, with one of the best bread shops you absolutely cannot miss: Du Pain et Idees!  Back up in Montmartre with a panoramic view of the city is one of my favourite places to visit in Paris: Sacre Coeur. The prettiest view is from the base of the stairs, though if you arrive during the day or early evening you will have to wade your way past the beggars and scammers trying to place bracelets on your wrist and make you pay (just confidently walk post with a prompt “non” in response).  As one of the world’s most stunning displays of stained glass, the recently re-opened Sainte-Chapelle is a picture-perfect Instagram photo waiting to happen. Be sure to arrive early to avoid the crowds, though even if you arrive later in the day this is a line worth waiting in!  If there’s one carrousel you should visit in Paris for an iconic view of the Eiffel Tower, its the carrousel located at the base of the trocadero. Pick up a box of macarons from Carette en route, sit down, and take it all in with each sugary bite.  Although technically outside of Paris, a visit to Versailles is a must for any first-timer! The gardens of Versailles are the most intsagrammable you will find, with perfectly positioned symmetry and equally perfect hedge trimmings.  Last but not least, the stunning interiors of The Louvre! I must admit it took me about 8 visits to Paris before I worked up the courage to visit the Louvre, fearful mostly of the lines and wasting my time in them instead of being outdoors experience Parisian cafe culture. But alas, I finally made it on this 2017 trip to Paris! The hallowed halls are some of the most impressive I have seen worldwide and an instagram just waiting to happen.   ."

65,"The cocktail scene in Paris has never been better. The city is catching up with the likes of New York and London and an array of speakeasies, glamorous terraces and secret underground dens are popping up every other month. We’ve hit the town, sampled the liquor and done all of the hard work for you, to create this guide to the Best 10 Mixologist Cocktail Bars in Paris.  Chances are you might not have heard of most of the spirits, liqueurs or homemade syrups which go into the cocktails, but have faith in the mixologist bartenders who know their bourbons from their whiskeys. Each cocktail is a piece of art, especially when paired with the tapas style dishes or oysters on the menu. 1 Rue Commines, 75003 Paris,  Le Perchoir has gained a reputation throughout Paris for its excellent drinks, convivial atmosphere and open terrace where groups flock come the summer months earning itself cult status as the ‘Best Rooftop Bar in Paris’. The long queues are worth the killer views and watching the sun slowly set behind Sacré Coeur with a drink in hand is the icing on the cake. The first was such a success that a second has opened more centrally with views overlooking the beautiful and gothic town hall known as Hotel de Ville. (Photo by Where Kate Resides) 14 Rue Crespin du Gast, 75011 Paris At the back of this casual and authentic Mexican jaunt, lies a clandestine cocktail bar that only those in the know frequent. Go right to the back of the restaurant and join the locals at one of the coolest mixologist bars in town where many of the drinks have a Mexican kick such as La Guèpe Verte, a concoction of chili infused agave tequila, agave syrup, lime juice and coriander. 52 Rue de Saintonge, 75003 Paris  Experimental is entirely hidden from eyesight and intentionally so. The exterior is blacked out so that only those who know of its location would ever enter. If you happen to be so lucky to know of its existence, inside lies a mixologist cocktail bar like no other where the art of cocktail making is taken as seriously as it could be. 37 Rue Saint-Sauveur, 75002 Paris For one of the classiest spots in town for a nightcap, le Mini Palais is an excellent option. The bar is an extension of the celebrated restaurant and is located on a heated terrace with an eye-level view towards the Petit Palais and Pont Alexandre III. 3 Avenue Winston Churchill, 75008 Paris  Owned by the same group who set up the aforementioned Experimental, Le Ballroom du Beefclub is of a similar concept. Hidden behind an inconspicuous black door, the telltale sign being the bouncer standing in front, give him a nod and you’ll be permitted entrance to the underground speakeasy via a spiral staircase. Live jazz music and expertly crafted cocktails await making this Paris’ best kept secret cocktail bar. If you get hungry, you can order a seafood platter or charcuterie board, among other apéro type dishes. 58 Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 75001 Paris,  Dirty Dick is the tiki bar that has everyone talking about it. Located in the trendy So-Pi district, the place is bursting with crowds who know how to have a good time and bartenders sporting Hawaiian-inspired shirts who know how to make a good cocktail. Try the signature Zombie, a lethal concoction of several rums, herbs and tropical fruits served in a tribal mask imprinted cup. (Photo by C Griffoulières) 10 Rue Frochot, 75009 Paris  Just up the road from Dirty Dick, lies this American-inspired up-market cocktail bar which gets everything right. Bottled beers are served with gourmet hotdogs and house-made pickles. Expect your craft beer to be paired with and proceeded by a lethal shot. Glass is fun, funky and different to any other bar in the city and is exactly what Paris has been missing. (Photo by Diane Abroad) 7 Rue Frochot, 75009 Paris  Located along the bustling rue Cler, this café/bar is as Parisian as cocktail bars come in Paris. They serve a wicked porn star martini made with passion fruit, vodka and a shot of prosecco on the side. 32 Rue Cler, 75007 Paris  The bar with the best view over Paris would have to be Hotel Raphael. The terrace of this 5* luxury hotel offers a breathtaking panorama of the iconic Eiffel Tower to one side and the Arc de Triomphe to the other. The cocktails are equally as good as the view, however they don’t come cheap at 30 euros a pop. They do however get served with a side of complimentary macarons and nuts. 17 Avenue Kléber, 75116 Paris Photography and words by Faye Bullock"
66,"  For nearly 3,000 years the city of Rome has been a living history of art, architecture, culture, and cuisine. Known as the eternal city, Rome is home to Vatican City, home of the Roman Catholic Church and the official residence for the Pope. Yet with all this history steeped in tradition, Rome is a city known for La Dolce Vita, the good life, and if you blink it can be hard to keep up with the fast-paced nature of this city. Here is our complete guide to both the old and new Rome – the ancient history mixed with the newest rooftop bars and most importantly where to get the best pizza.  Rome is sprawling and packed with history at every turn, but no matter the size of the city the best way to see it is on foot. Be sure to pack your comfiest walking shoes – not only is there much ground to cover but there’s also a maze of uneven cobblestone to endure – you’ve been warned! Start at the Roman Forum and walk through the ruins of the site that dates back to 500 B.C. Next, make your way over to the Colosseum and listen to the audio guide tour that will take you back in time to a period of gladiatorial games. With more than 4 million people visiting annually, grab yourself a trio ticket from the Roman Forum that includes Palatine Hill and the Colosseum (and lets you skip the line – you’re welcome!)  Next, make your way over to the Pantheon, the burial place of Rome’s kings and prominent figures. Its a 2 kilometre walk from the Colosseum or four stops by bus (#85 or #87). From here make your way on foot to Piazza Navona, one of the most bustling public places in all of Rome, before making your way onwards to the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps.  Of course no visit to Rome would be complete without a visit to The Vatican, though you may want to allow a full day with the seemingly endless lines, crowds, and so much to see while you’re there. Be sure to allow time to actually step inside St. Peter’s Basilica and keep one eye open for Bernini’s great bronze baldacchino and Michelangelo’s Pietà.  Rome’s backstreets are often overlooked as visitors to the city dart across town from one tourist attraction to the next. However if you want to see the real beauty to Rome, get lost in the side streets and check out some of our favourite hidden spots. Via Margutta runs parallel to Via del Corso, just a couple of streets over and feels a world away from the hustle and bustle. Ponte Umberto has one of the best views in the entire city, worthy of a postcard and indeed I have no doubt it has a place on at least one.  Pincian Hill is one of the best views over the city and despite being an uphill battle, is a great excuse to work off some of those extra calories you’re no doubt squeezing in every minute of the day. The Aventine Keyhole has become a famous view of the city and is well hidden inside the gardens of the Villa del Priorato di Malta.  I’m so glad you asked – because boy do I make it a job of mine to find the best food in any city and when it comes to Rome, calories don’t count. The best gelato in town is at Giolitti and if you know what’s good for you, you’ll order a double scoop: one dark chocolate, one raspberry. Be prepared to fight the crowds to finally order – I promise you it is worth every effort. Testaccio is where you’ll find the best Roman cuisine – hands down, no questions asked. They have a few tables outside for lunches and dinners, just be prepared to wait as this is one of the most popular spots in town amongst the locals.  For the best sunset cocktails, check out the rooftop bar atop Hotel Eden and ask for their house special (beware, it is potent, but a great kick starter to any night out in Rome). For the best sunset spot (and arguably the best kept secret in Rome) head to Terraza Borromini for a sunset sip and easily one of the best views over the city. "
67,"Prague is hands down one of the most beautiful cities in all of Europe and even more so when seen from above. The city has a landscape so unique (a mixture of mostly Bohemian and Gothic architecture) that it can only be truly appreciated when you see it from above or from one of the city’s best viewing points. On my Christmas visit to Prague I took on the task of finding the best views over the city and below is a collection of the best views to take in the magic of Prague!  For the most classic 360 degree view over Prague you can’t go past a climb up the Old Town Tower. The good news is the steep stairs are gone (replaced with a ramp that is easy to walk up) or you can even take a lift if you fear you might run out of breath! The ticket price is Kč250 (approx 9.50€) which is well worth the views over the Old Town.  From the top of the tower you can see the city in every direction. Be sure not to miss the view over the Old Town and if you’re visiting during December, the view of the Christmas markets below. On the other side of the tower you can also see Prague Castle in the distance. The best time of day to climb to the top of the tower is around golden hour for sunset, though if you are visiting Prague during the colder months sunshine can be limited and thus a visit in overcast conditions is good any time of day!  Speaking of Prague Castle, the hill on which the castle resides also has an incredible view of the city from afar. This view is one of the best places to watch the sun set over the hill and brings some of the best golden daylight before the sun sets. Best of all – this view is completely free!  For a small fee you can also climb the Charles Bridge Tower which overlooks the bridge and its many pedestrians below. This is one of my favourite viewing points at sunrise or sunset, as well as the hour after sunset known as blue hour. The eeriness of Charles Bridge below really sets in at dusk and dawn, as the birds circle the bridge and darkness provides an eery backdrop for the city.  Although Charles Bridges is Prague’s most famous bridge (and for good reason – it is the most beautiful!) the two bridges either side of it are well worth a visit for a view of Charles Bridge from across the water. Most Legii provides a great view in the early hours of the morning when the sun rises or begins to settle in to the buildings and provide a beautiful reflection in the water below.  Another bridge with a great view of Charles Bridge is Manesuc Most, located on the other side of Charles Bridge near to where the swans congregate. This bridge is better visited later in the day so you can capture the sun setting in the background. From there be sure to make a quick run for the Prague Castle and catch the sunrise itself!  Finally if you’re looking for a hidden secret not known to many: the terrace on top of the Aria Hotel has one of my favourite rooftop views in all of Prague. I could spend hours up there watching the city wake up or settle in for the evening! The hotel has been newly renovated and is my favourite place to stay in the city (and believe me, I’ve stayed in quite a few hotels in Prague!) The atmosphere is lovely and the staff make it feel like coming home every time. "
68,"Croatia has it all: rugged coves, pristine beaches, medieval towns and natural wonders, making it the perfect holiday destination for adventurers and sun worshippers alike. There is so much to do and see in this beautiful country that it would be impossible to do it all in one short trip. To narrow it down for you, here are 10 things you cannot miss when visiting Croatia!  Korčula is a beautiful island of rugged coves and fragrant pine trees, the kind of place which instantly stole my heart. The town is idyllic with its waterside restaurants, medieval churches and some of the prettiest backstreets I’ve ever laid eyes on. Take a day to meander all of the cobbled streets and have a leisurely lunch beneath the pines. The best way to explore the rest of the island and all of its hidden corners is by hiring a scooter or quad bike.  It may be a steep and arduous incline, but the views which await at the top are worth every second of the walk. The panorama overlooks the old town of Hvar, the marina and the cluster of Pakleni Islands. Go at sunset for a golden glow over the terracotta-hued rooftops.  Krka waterfall is the second most visited in Croatia, after Plitvice lakes, however what makes it so special is you can swim in the fresh waters beneath the powerful waterfall. The water is cold, but how could you not take a dip in such a surreal surrounding!?  Dubrovnik is as pretty as a postcard with its winding backstreets, orange-hued rooftops and medieval architecture. The best way to see the city and the surrounding Adriatic sea is by walking the city walls.  Plitvice lakes had been high on my bucket list for as long as I can remember so I was so happy to finally tick them off. Standing atop the cliff edge watching the powerful waterfalls cascade below was one of the most surreal moments of the trip. The lakes are overwhelmingly big, you could easily spend a whole day or multiple days exploring. Plitvice lakes is one of the most visited sights in Croatia, so be prepared for lots of people, especially in the summer months. Come early and be the first to enter so that you have the lakes all to yourself to appreciate them at their most tranquil. Trogir is a city built within medieval walls and surrounded by water. It has earned itself UNESCO world heritage status for its Romanesque and Renaissance architecture. Spend a day weaving in and out of the cobbled backstreets, stocking up on Croatian olive oil and climbing the fortress for views over the historic city center.  Šibenik is home to Croatia’s best restaurant: Peligrini. It has earned this award for the second year in a row at the annual Dobri restaurant awards. On the menu you’ll find traditional Croatian dishes with a twist such as truffle and prosciutto pasta with sheep’s cheese and lamb with paprika puree. The restaurant prides itself on the quality of ingredients sourced in Croatia, as well its Dalmatian wine list. Whilst there make sure to explore the beautiful town of Šibenik, climb the fortress and visit St James’ cathedral.  Dugi Otok is completely off the radar making it the perfect island getaway. There are no chic bars, no fine dining, few commodities but there are also very little tourists so you’ll feel as though the island is all yours. Visit idyllic beaches such as Sakarun and explore its rugged beauty by visiting Telašćica Nature Park.  Croatia’s beaches are sites of beauty. The colour of the sea varies from deep turquoise to emerald and often the beaches are surrounded by pine trees and verdant trees. The Adriatic sea is one of the best in the Med with its beautiful colour and underwater life so be sure to swim in it as often as you can.    Often overlooked and used as a jumping point to Croatia’s islands, Split is not only the best connected town for catching ferries but it is also a very pretty town. Climb the bell tower for panoramic views over the city, have dinner in Diocletian’s Palace and explore the cobbled backstreets and you’re sure to fall under its charm.

71,"In a world where travel is more accessible and affordable than ever, most of us are packing our bags a few times a year to travel the world and discover new places. Blagaj Tekija is a monastery in Bosnia & Herzegovina built into a cliff. It is one of the examples in a new wave of tourism whereby travellers are seeing a photo online, researching the location, and planning a trip based around their findings. If you would like to visit Blagaj Tekija, the good news is it is easier than you might think. If you are visiting nearby Croatia, a visit to Blagaj Tekija is incredibly easy. It only takes a day to cross the border and visit both the monastery and nearby Mostar. Here is our guide to help you plan your visit and get a slice of Bosnian history while you’re there. Blagaj Tekija is a Dervish monastery built into the cliffs of Blagaj. The monastery overlooks a pristine body of turquoise water. Chances are you have already seen it on Instagram or Pinterest, as it has been popularised. The monastery is almost 600 years old and can be reached in just 20 minutes drive from Mostar, the popular Once here there are a few small restaurants lining the banks of the river. Most of these have popped up to serve tourism and can be a bit of a tourist trap. I would recommend saving your hunger for nearby Mostar, where you will find many great restaurants. Just ask a local where to get some great Bosnian food and you’ll be spoiled for choice. For my time in Blagaj I stayed with a local family in their three bedroom home. This was a great way for me to experience the culture firsthand as well as getting local tips for the best places to see nearby.

72,"Picnics and Paris go hand in hand. Kind of like ketchup and mayonnaise or chocolate gelato and raspberry sorbet. Okay, fine. Picnics and Paris aren’t quite as complimentary as ketchup and mayonnaise (what could be, really?) But they are certainly a great way to spend some time in the city. Every year I visit Paris in the Spring and picnics are almost always on my agenda. So I thought I would share my tips for how to have a picnic in Paris for those of you interested in hosting your own! You can also follow along on Instagram to see more of my adventures.   During my most recent trip to Paris, an old friend came to visit me from Denmark. Her and I met five years ago when I was visiting Copenhagen. Jasmina had offered to show me around her city and we instantly became great friends. A couple of years later I received a wedding invite in Arabic, inviting me to her wedding in Tunisia. Five years later we met up in Paris and our day scavenger hunting for goodies around Paris to take to our picnic has been one of my favourite days in Paris of all my trips here. Good company, good food, and that view! If you’re pushed for time, there are a couple of companies who actually source the products themselves and deliver a basket to you in a park of your choice. It is much more expensive, but I suppose has the benefit of a picnic rug and a basket (though you don’t get to go on an adventure around town and have all the fun!)  If you chance your visit on a warm day in Spring or Summer, be sure to avoid chocolate! A great alternative that won’t melt is a cream puff – which are currently all the rage in Paris. Popelini has one of the largest selections in terms of flavour and is also considered by many to be the best in Paris.  Another great sweet treat that won’t melt in the sun is my favourite treat of all time: macarons! Nowadays you can buy macarons all over the city – at every bakery and patisserie you stumble upon. My favourite macarons are those from Carette – they’re a little more soft and cloudy than those at Laduree. Pierre Herme is great for inventive flavours, though I’d steer clear of his salted caramel macarons, there are more flavoursome options elsewhere.  You’ll be spoiled for choice when it comes to bread and Paris, so don’t fret if this is the last thing you buy. A trust baguette goes down well with a cheese platter (cheese shops can be a little harder to find, but continue reading for assistance). Whilst there you might as well throw in a croissant or two!  A little shortcut never hurt nobody! On a day sourcing produce we were having difficulty finding a cheese store open on the weekend, so in a last ditch effort to gather our goodies, dropped in to a Monoprix (a.k.a. supermarket) to top up our stash.

73,"After a handful of visits to Rome over the past few years, I’m convinced I could never tire of this city. Whether you’re roaming the city streets with a slice of fresh pizza in hand or navigating your way through a melting tri-scoop gelato cone, you’re going to find this city is best discovered when you’re in the know. So, where are the best views in Rome? You’re about to find out! I set off to discover the best photographic points in the city with local guide Simone, who helped me discover the best of Rome is both in the old and new: the discovered and undiscovered. So here we have the very best views of Rome!  A relatively recent addition to the rooftop bar scene of Rome (which is surprisingly few and far between), Terraza Borromini might just be the best kept local secret. The terrace overlooks a panoramic view of the city and is best visited at golden hour, with plenty of time to unwind with an aperitif and wait for the sunset to roll in. Just be sure to book a table in advance! It is very popular among the local crowd. Location: Via di Santa Maria dell’Anima, 30A, 00186 Roma  Hands down one of Rome’s best sunset locations, Pincio Hill is a must-visit when in Rome. This hill has a great view over the city from afar, is free, and provides a little exercise to walk off that carb-heavy lunch! I would recommend visiting the hill at first light or the end of the day. That way you can capture a gorgeous glow over the city. Location: Pincio Hill, Roma  Built sometime in the late 19th century, Ponte Umberto provides the perfectly quintessential Roman backdrop. We visited the bridge in the morning before it was too busy. The setting of the river flowing was just too beautiful to ignore! Located on the River Tiber, this postcard-perfect setting is one of my all-time favourite views in Rome from ground level. Location: Ponte Umberto I, River Tiber, Roma  No list of Rome’s greatest views would be complete without mention of the iconic Roman Forum, a collection of ruins at the ancient centre of Rome. This view is best enjoyed at sunrise without crowds and tour groups, so be sure to arrive early! Location: Via della Salara Vecchia, 5/6, 00186 Roma For more of my adventures, follow along on Instagram!"
74,"Riding along the French Riviera with the wind in my hair has long been a dream of mine, and while I first imagined it would involve a tanned Italian boy at the steering wheel of a classic vintage car… driving myself on a 50 km/h vespa was a second prize I was willing to accept. If you find yourself in the South of France and would like to recreate my journey in one day, I took the route from Cannes through to Monaco and back, which could easily be done in the reverse direction or dragged out to a few days should you have more time to stop in each destination overnight. Here are the highlights!  For my first stop in the South of France, I flew to Nice Airport from Paris and transferred to my beachside hotel in Cannes. You have probably already heard the name before in reference to the Cannes film festival, which takes place in Spring each year and attracts a wide-range of celebs and their wannabe counterparts to the exotic beachside destination. Visiting during Cannes Film Festival is both expensive and exhausting (the latter coming as a point of reference only, from a local who relives the experience year after year). The hotel rates during the festival are sometimes double and certainly always booked out a year in advance. Visiting outside of the festival is thus a much preferred option for us mere mortals, who could quite happily do without a celeb sighting in acceptance for the trade of serenity and being able to enjoy much of the city to yourself in the early hours of the morning when the sun comes up.  The journey from Cannes along the French Riviera could go in either direction of the coastline, but because I was busting to see Monaco as my final destination for the day I chose this direction and forfeited St Tropez from my trip. My first stop was the city of Nice, though I would recommend first stopping in Antibes if you manage to find it (I myself was not so fortunate, though in retrospect I’m 90% certain I drove through it without even realising – oof!) Nice is approximately 33 kilometres from Cannes, though it will take you significantly longer than Google maps would suggest, thanks to your slower pace on board a vespa and a strong recommendation to follow the coastline and ignore the signs leading you elsewhere (in land to the highway, no less). Vespas are restricted from the main motorway, so it best to drive along the coast and enjoy the scenery as you go. I personally tried to do just this, but made some miserable choices when following the road signs and wound up lost for hours, stuck on the highway going 50 km/h in a 110 zone – both illegal and more than a little nerve-wracking (but somehow still so fun)!  The highlight of my day was driving from Nice through to Monaco, and in particular one important little stop along the way. The drive from Nice through to Monaco features three alternative routes or “corniches” as the French say. The lower corniche will take you along the coastline itself, the middle offers the best view, and the highest corniche is best for fast cars (I chose the middle). Just a ten minute drive from Monaco you will stumble upon the small seaside village of Eze. This village is commonly regarded as one of the most beautiful small towns in France and it is not hard to see why when you’re standing atop the cobblestone walkways, looking down over the ocean! The town can be explored on foot in around 20 minutes if you rush, or up to an hour wandering around the alleyways. There’s plenty of parking before you make the final trek up to the village and vespas can park for free.  For my final stop along the French Riviera, I finally (albeit very delayed) made it to Monaco. Although a separate state, the principality of Monaco isn’t much different to other nearby cities like Nice or Cannes, except for the fact it is much cleaner, more opulent, and absolutely packed with tourists around the Monte Carlo casino area. With so much to see and do in Monaco, I’d recommend staying a night or two if you can afford it, in order to make the most of the city and explore its’ royal history inside the palace and surrounds.  I travelled from Australia to France with Cathay Pacific, with a short stopover in Hong Kong. From there I connected with Air France to Cannes and boarded an Avalon Waterways 10 day cruise up to Paris – très magnifique! I rented a vespa for 35€ (day rental) from Elite Rentals in Cannes. The journey from Cannes to Monaco says 1 hour 15 minutes on Google maps, but in reality is at least 1 hour 45 minutes on a vespa, without making any wrong turns. The best pit stops are Nice, Eze and Monaco, though if you have more time be sure to check out Antibes and even onwards to Menton."
75,"The Czech Republic’s second-largest city is relatively unknown. Many travellers sing the praise of well-known Prague, but just as many haven’t even heard of Brno. Nestled nicely between Vienna and Bratislava, Brno fits perfectly into any central European itinerary. If you’re wondering how to spend 48 hours in Brno, we’ve got you covered. The city has a small old town that is manageable largely by foot, but it does have a great (and cheap) public transport system for when we want to get out a little further.  Start the day off right at SKOG Urban Hub, a hipsters paradise the delicious coffee and fresh food will not disappoint. Then see the sights of Náměstí Svobdy or “Liberty Square”, this is the most central part of the city and will help you to get some bearings. It also contains one of Brno’s most infamous sights, the astronomical clock. To the trained eye it can help you tell the time, but to the untrained eye, well… you can make up your own mind. If you’re feeling lucky, at 11:00am each day the clock releases a small ball from one of its many holes. Sound a bit strange? It kind of is. Next, head over to the Old Town Hall which is home to the Dragon of Brno, a legend any local should be able to explain. The tower can also be climbed for a small fee. Your next stop is Špilberk Castle. On the way, you will pass the Moravian Gallery which has a great free exhibition and rotating paid exhibitions if you fancy a cultural stop off. If you feel like a rehydrating stop off, try U Alberta for an authentic Czech beer. Once you set off again, the climb to the castle will take you through the park, and once you make it to the top you can walk around the castle ground with no entry fee. From there you can see the many sides of Brno and the park surrounding it is also beautiful.  After all that walking you will have worked up an appetite. Brno has a large Vietnamese population and Go Brno has tasty Vietnamese to show. Burger Inn easily does the best burgers and Bar Atelier might be the go if you’re looking for something a little fancier. To finish the evening head to Utopia – a grungy, underground labyrinth. This bar is full of pool tables, darts, and nooks and crannies filled with board games.  Recovery begins with a good breakfast, Café Momenta is wonderfully placed on the edge of Zelny Trh; a square when local farmers bring produce most days of the week, so heading there will kill two birds with one stone. Near the market place is the Brno Underground, a series of underground cellars that used to house the produce from the city which might interest those interested in medieval history.  From there, head to Villa Tugendhat, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site designed by the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and built from 1929–1930. Just be sure to pre-book well in advance as this is incredibly popular. From here, Lužánky Park is not far to walk. Filled with life on a good day you’ll find plenty to people watch. If you need a coffee and cake to keep going, at this point Punkt and Mymika are both nearby. These cafes offer wonderful selections of cakes coupled with delicious coffee. For lunch, Bistro Franz offers locally sourced ingredients with a retro, laid back interior. Vegalite will have you overwhelmed with vegan and vegetarian options is this is more your thing. Now it’s time to see Brno from above. Head to the Church of St Peter and Paul and climb the tower. This offers the most beautiful view of the cities rooftops, particularly when they’re covered in snow.  Finally, finish off your time in Brno with dinner at Soul Bistro and then head to the speakeasy cocktail bar Super Panda Circus. The door, that is easily missed, has a small doorbell that will need to be rung. Someone will them come to greet you. The theme of the cocktail bar rotates regularly and staff will make a cocktail from any description you feed them. If you find they’re full, head to their sister bar, Bar That Doesn’t Exist. This place has more space and some bar food but the same great service and variety. It’s a bonus that it’s just down the road from St Jakub’s square, a hotspot for locals to gather and have a drink outside. "
76,"The countdown to Christmas is on and the amount of times I have watched A Christmas Prince on Netflix is becoming some sort of a record. But when I looked up A Christmas Prince filming locations I was surprised to see very little information online about this beautiful castle and how to visit it. The film is set in a real-life castle I have visited in Romania, so I figured this would be a great chance to plug one of my favourite Eastern Europe locations and encourage a few of you to consider Romania on your next travel plans!  It was a couple of years ago that I first visited Peleș Castle in Sinaia, Romania. The country had long been on my list of dream travels and when I found myself with a few weeks to spare between my travels in Hungary and onwards to Italy, I figured what better time to book a train further East and check out Romania. The castle that had originally drawn me to Romania was Dracula’s Castle (Bran Castle), a much less romantic and more terrifying castle a short drive away near Bran. To travel between the two you will need a vehicle, or find a friendly local who is more than happy to act as chauffeur for a small fee (cheers Claudio!)  This Neo-Renaissance castle is located in the Carpathian Mountains and is commonly regarded as the most romantic castle in all of Europe (and it isn’t hard to see why!) The medieval route where the castle is located travels between Transylvania and Wallachia, twisting and turning between some of the most beautiful scenery you could imagine. Construction of the castle began in 1873 and was commissioned by King Carol I of Romania, who is highly celebrated as he was responsible for the country gaining its independence. The castle, as in the film, boasts a royal stable, impressive court of manicured hedges, and yes, all of the statues in the film are real too! Although any time of year is impressive to visit the castle, the most magical would be in a light layer of snow through the winter, or in a stream of autumn colours in the fall.   For my visit to the most beautiful and celebrated castles in Romania, I chose to base myself in Brasov, located 48 kilometres from Peleș Castle. This small but charming little town has a deserted feel to it between dusk to dawn but makes for a great base to explore the region. Alternatively, you could stay closer to the castle in one of the small boutique hotels in Sinaia, though a hire car will be required for the length of your stay. Elsewhere in Romania, you’ll find many captivating small towns, impressive mountain scenery and eclectic cities to discover, so be sure to make a trip of it! Other highlights for me included Sibiu, Timisoara and Sighisoara. You can find more of my adventures on Instagram."
77,"My time in the Netherlands came and went in a flash. But if we’re being particular it lasted 8 days and 7 nights, all of which were jam-packed. So if you’re wondering which cities you must visit in the Netherlands, these are my top picks. Throughout my time here in the land of bicycles and miniature pancakes I was eager to see, do and taste as much as possible. Although I didn’t quite get to every pitstop I had planned, I did manage to see and do everything I wanted in each of the cities I did visit, making up for quality over quantity. Let’s dive in! An obvious starting point: Amsterdam is one of Europe’s most visited cities and with one picture or postcard, it isn’t hard to see why. This city, built on canals with wonky houses, would have to be one of the world’s most photographed cities if not the most. Be sure to wander around at leisure and leave yourself three days here (minimum) as there’s a lot to see and do. In terms of museums make sure you don’t miss the Anne Frank House, Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. Elsewhere be sure to visit Singel Canal, Keizersgracht Canal, Vondelpark and Jordaan neighbourhood. My next stop in the Netherlands was to catch the (30 minutes-ish) train ride to The Hague, which is better known to the Dutchies as Den Haag. As the centre for global judiciary decisions, I had been eager to visit since my first two years of law school (of which I dropped out of to complete a political science degree). This city was as grand as I had envisioned, with beautiful architecture and perfectly manicured gardens at every turn.  image via Flickr You can reach Leiden by train from Amsterdam in less than 30 minutes, or by train from The Hague in just 10. Pronounced “LIE – DEN”, this city is a great pit stop if travelling between one Dutch city and another, dropping your bags at the train station and exploring for a day. With canals and quintessentially Dutch architecture, this is a great alternative to the tourist-heavy streets of Amsterdam. By far the cutest city I came across in all of the Netherlands and even one of the most charming in all of Europe, I cannot believe it has taken me so many years of travel to discover Delft! Just a few minutes by train from The Hague, Delft has the charm of a small town with the benefits of a sizeable city nearby (not to mention some of the world’s best gelato!) Described to me as Amsterdam’s cooler little sister, Utrecht is a city like no other in the Netherlands and perhaps even in Europe (though it kind of reminded me of the effortless coolness of Antwerp and Ghent in Belgium). Utrecht doesn’t have many sights or attractions, but has plenty of cool cafes, eateries and boutiques to discover. Its the kind of city you can visit and feel like a local within minutes. Image via Flickr Perhaps the “coolest” city in the Netherlands, Rotterdam is in a league of its own. Modern and design-focused, Rotterdam was completely wiped out by the Germans in in 1940 as a sign of power to the rest of the country who might similarly meet the Germany army with resistance. For this reason Rotterdam is extremely unique to the Netherlands, as it does not have an old town centre or appear alike any of the other cities in the country, though it does have a widespread reputation for architecture and design. Well and truly in the south of the Netherlands is Maastricht, another interesting city I discovered on my travels through the country and one that I found a great base to explore from. With a unique location near to the Belgium border and not far from France or Germany, this is a great city to base yourself in for day trips to explore nearby Cologne, Liege, and you could even travel down in to Luxembourg! The city itself warrants a couple of days to explore – Maastricht iss a beautiful city with a well-deserved gastronomic reputation. Of all the cities you must visit in the Netherlands, I think Maastricht is the most underrated. "
78,"A Paris day trip is a part of the Paris experience itself. Château de Bagatelle is one such hideaway outside of the city to find yourself enjoying the lush greenery, peacocks and a quintessential picnic hamper in the gardens!  Little known to tourists, the Château de Bagatelle is hidden away in the vast Bois de Boulogne, a forest which spans 2090 acres across Paris. Whilst some might deem the castle too close to central Paris to bear the title of a daytrip, we would argue it too beautiful not to, because a full day is required to truly do the grounds justice. It’s set amongst some of the prettiest gardens in Paris, dotted with pagodas and peacocks it’s impossible not to fall under its charm.  Initially built as a modest hunting lodge in 1720 for the maréchal d’Estrées, it was later knocked down and rebuilt by Louis XVI’s brother in 1775. Marie Antoinette advised her brother-in-law not to tear it down urging that it would take longer than 3 months to rebuild however he was adamant to prove her wrong and completed the project within 63 days.  The castle itself is unassumingly small, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in charm. The dusty pink hued castle which greets you upon entering the grounds is a pretty sight to behold. The building was constructed in Neoclassical architectural style by Francois-Joseph Belanger.  The castle is undoubtedly charming but the grounds which surround it are the real treat. They contain within them, a Japanese pagoda, English rose gardens, an orangery and caves and grottoes with water running through them.  One of the highlights of the gardens are the English rose gardens which showcase endless bushes of roses in every shade. Every year a rose competition is held at Bagatelle where international contenders compete for the best roses run by the City of Paris.  Beautifully colourful peacocks roam the gardens freely and confidently showing off their feathers frequently enough to please visitors. It’s amazing sharing the gardens with such beautiful birds and roaming the pathways with them surrounding you.  Why not stay in central Paris, save the train fare and uncover one of Paris’ best kept secrets? It’s not very easy to access by metro, so instead hire a Vélib bike and cycle through the forest with the cool breeze blowing between the trees and then walk the short distance from the Vélib station to the entrance. My best advice would be to get a group of friends together and fill your bicycle baskets with picnic treats so you can spend an entire day enjoying the castle and its grounds at leisure.

79,"It came as a surprise to me that Ljubljana has so many great vegan restaurants and cafes. When I visited five years ago, I did not know where to find the best vegan in Ljubljana. In fairness, there wasn’t really a lot to choose from anywhere in Central Europe back then. Now, Ljubljana has become a vegan foodie paradise (and great vegetarian food, too!) The very first restaurant I dined at in Ljubljana was Monstera Bistro. This small casual eatery is just a short walk from triple bridge on Gosposka ulica. Although the restaurant serves both plant meals and meat eater meals, the food was so tasty that I’d recommend it for vegan and vegetarians who are travelling with friends or family who aren’t vegan. There is a strong focus on local produce so this is a great way to enjoy fresh, seasonal produce from an inspired and ever-changing menu. Address: Gosposka ulica 9, 1000 Ljubljana This small casual vegan eatery is probably my top pick for delicious all-vegan food in Ljubljana. The cafe is open for lunch and dinner daily with a changing menu. They also offer a really great range of brownies and sweet treats, so be sure to stock up before you leave Ljubljana. Address: Komenskega ulica 30, 1000 Ljubljana Taman Organic has probably the best vegan salad in the entire city. The menu is entirely vegan with a lot of choice, so if you are looking for a restaurant that is strictly vegan look no further. Taman are open every day except for Sundays, for both lunch and dinner. Address: Nazorjeva ulica 3, 1000 Ljubljana I discovered TINK almost by chance as it was just a short walk from my hotel. TINK is not completely vegan (there are meat options on the menu too) but the focus is on superfoods. They have probably the best acai bowl in town and this is reason enough to visit! Address: Tavčarjeva ulica 4, 1000 Ljubljana This cute little cafe has a wide range of gluten free and vegan options which change daily. The natural interiors with plants dotted around the place make this an aesthetically pleasing place to pass some time in Ljubljana. Be sure to try the elderflower lemonade! Address: Prešernova cesta 15, 1000 Ljubljana Known for their brunch offerings, EK Bistro always have vegan options on the menu. This is commonly considered the best brunch spot in town and is thus very popular with the locals, so be sure to book a table or arrive early! Address: Petkovškovo nabrežje 65, 1000 Ljubljana"
80,"There’s no denying my heart is in many ways in Europe. From the moment I stepped foot on the continent to my first time biting into a croissant in Le Marais, there are so many times I have scattered pieces of my heart around this continent. And I’m convinced Europe is always calling me home. But as for the most beautiful cities in Europe, I can’t pick just a few.  Europe is full of fascinating cities. From capitals like Budapest and Prague to the smaller cities of Verona and Bruges. There are so many defining moments and “aha!” moments I’ve had on my solo adventures across Europe. If you’re anything like me and seek out the best, you’ve come to the right place. This is my definitive list for the most beautiful cities in Europe. The capital of Italy’s region of Tuscany is commonly regarded as one of the most beautiful cities in the world. After visiting a handful of times over the years, I’ve gotta say I wholeheartedly agree. Florence is home to so much living history from the Renaissance period. You’ll be forgiven for giving yourself whiplash as you try to look in every direction and soak it all in! Beyond the Cathedral and the Ponte Vecchio, be sure to allow time to get off the main tourist thoroughfare. As soon as you walk across one of the many bridges, a whole other world awaits. Outside of the city centre, you can discover public parks, libraries, and smaller art galleries. There are few cities I can say compare to the beauty of Paris but Vienna is one such city that comes close. It has been described to me as a cleaner version of the French capital and having visited both a number of times, I can’t argue with that. The coffee house culture is however my favourite aspect of Vienna. It has a way of transporting you to a previous era with how stuffy and old school it is. But somehow it is also affectionately welcomed with open arms. Even for the younger generation, coffee houses are on trend! Read more: The central European trifecta: Visiting Vienna, Prague and Budapest I’ve said it before and I’ll stand by it time after time, Edinburgh would have to be one of the most underrated cities in Europe, if not the most. There’s something so magical and ethereal about this city that wins the hearts of many (myself included) almost instantly or in my case, before you even arrive. Bonus: there are a bunch of Harry Potter locations in the city. This is where J. K. Rowling herself wrote much of her work in cafes, drawing inspiration from locations throughout Edinburgh. Prague is undeniably one of the most charming cities to visit the world over. With a unique mix of gothic, romanesque and renaissance architectures, this city has endless beauty. The Old Town is abuzz with visitors any time of year. Therefore if you are trying to escape the crowds, get off the beaten path. Many of my favourite finds in Prague cannot be found in guidebooks. If you’ve been to Moscow you’ll know first hand how impressive and imperial this city is. And yet, it only became the capital of the former USSR in 1918. Despite this, there’s an impressive amount of history to discover throughout the capital, starting with the Red Square and of course Russia’s political hub; the Red Square. Bruges is a city so beautiful, you’d be forgiven for thinking you were in a real life story book. Commonly regarded to as the most beautiful city in all of Europe, Bruges’ old world charm has an authenticity that isn’t often mimicked in cities when hoards of travellers find out about its’ existence but – somehow – it is managed to retain its’ charm. When you arrive in Verona you might pass out in sheer disbelief of how a city can be so darn beautiful in such a casual, cool-girl kinda way. Verona is said to be the birthplace of Romeo and Juliet (contentious), however you’ll soon see how the rumour started when you spend more than five minutes in the place. Annecy is the kind of postcard town you think wouldn’t exist in real life but speaking from experience I can say with certainty that it is even more beautiful in person (hard to believe, I know!) Located in the southeast of France, the city overlooks Lake Annecy, has its’ own system of waterways and isn’t far from the alps, leaving it with a pinch-me backdrop to make it even more ethereal. A city as lovely as Budapest, its no wonder the Hungarian capital has become a hot spot for travellers doing the loop around Europe. Just a three hour train ride from Vienna, Budapest is an essential stop in central Europe not only for its unique and fascinating history, but also for its grandeur and beauty that could rival even Paris. The city is sprawling but mostly walkable, as much of the attractions are centred around the Danube. Be sure to venture over the river to Buda and visit Castle Hill and Fisherman’s Bastion for the best views of the city from above. It didn’t take me long to fall in love with Barcelona, one of Europe’s most vibrant cities. Full of colour, magnificent Gaudi architecture and some of the best food you’ll find across Europe (patatas bravas anyone!?), there’s so much to love about this city. As far as beauty goes, you can’t beat the endless architectural marvels in Barcelona – its a picture perfect postcard waiting to happen. Amsterdam is one of Europe’s most visited cities and for good reason. Once known as the weed capital of the world (California’s legalisation and those that followed suit has kinda dulled it down), Amsterdam has a lively appeal that attracts young travellers with magnetic force. With its canals and famous canal houses, this is easily one of the most beautiful cities in all of Europe. If you’ve been on this blog before, you’ll know first hand that my obsession with Paris is real. As real as it gets. If you can see Paris through the lens of the 1950’s, you’ll fall even more in love with the city of light – full of culture, art and a living literary history through its many cafes, bars, streets and sidewalks that have appeared in the works of the lost generation. Mykonos is one of those cities I knew I’d fall head over heels in love with but for one reason or another, it took me some time before I finally visited Greece. This party centre is as fun as it is beautiful – but for the best of Mykonos, be sure to explore in the early hours of the morning before the crowds take to the streets. I didn’t spend enough time in Malta but I’m itching to go back. This country is full of beautiful architecture, an impressive history, and some of the loveliest locals you’ll meet – they are proud to call Malta home and they can’t wait to share it with you. Valletta, the capital, is at the heart of this country and having been established in 1500, is as old as it looks. Copenhagen is one of the prettiest seaside cities and as classic as Nordic cities come. Nyhaven, the collection of colourful houses by the sea, is one of Europe’s most photographed spots and for good reason – it looks too beautiful to be real! However there is much more of this city to discover when you venture in to the city streets – castles, whimsical gardens and Danish pastries are just the beginning. When I visited Stockholm for the first time I knew it wouldn’t be the last. The capital of Sweden is so charming and quaint that you’d be forgiven for forgetting this is a city of almost one million inhabitants. The city encompasses 14 islands and thus much of it is surrounded by water – connected by bridges and illuminating effortlessly in the setting sun. Tallinn is Europe’s fairytale town: the one and only city where you simple cannot, at any turn within the Old Town Walls, be surrounded by what feels like magic. There’s an original chemist selling unicorn dust, for a start. When you hear people talk of the prettiest city in Norway you never really hear them say Alesund. I’m changing that. Having had Bergen on my bucket list for quite some time, I was surprised to see the incredible Art Nouveau architecture of Alesund. And quite frankly, I was stunned that I had not stumbled upon it sooner. Having rebuilt after a fire in 1904, the city has managed to retain its authenticity and charm with ease. I was obsessed with St Petersburg before I even stepped foot on Russian soil. Having studied Russian History in my first year of university, I had a lot of appreciation for the East of Europe – the trials and tribulations it faced as Peter the Great looked toward the West for change and evolution. I would go so far as to say that St Petersburg is my favourite city in all of Europe and full of so much imperial and imposing beauty that I believe everyone should see it at least once. The Hermitage Museum, Peter’s Summer Palace and the canals that give this city the nickname “Venice of the North” are just the beginning. Zurich is one of the most beautiful cities in all of Switzerland and just by looking at photos alone, it isn’t hard to see why. This city if charming with an attention to detail like no other. Lisbon is still one of my favourite cities in Western Europe, despite becoming one of the most popular and trending cities im Europe over recent years (thanks in part to how affordable it is!) The city is bursting with colour and life at every turn, especially in the neighbourhood of Alfama. I wasn’t expecting to love Strasbourg nearly as much as I did and as such, considered it a stopover city en route to Colmar in the Alsace region. However this would have to be one of Europe’s most underrated, prettiest cities. Bordering Germany, the French city has a unique blend of architecture that you won’t find elsewhere. Ghent will steal your heart in an instant. This university city is an interesting one: old in looks but young at heart, with a thriving student population that make this a really fun city to visit. Only a short train ride from Bruges, I would argue if you’re visiting one you must visit the other: they’re both so similar but yet so different! I will never forget the first time I visited Rome. It was with my father at 17 years of age and perhaps the single-most city I remember most: every detail. We were both visiting Europe for the first time and were in awe of the history – so much so that it almost feels like a dream looking back. We spent a week exploring the sights and eating our way into a carb-induced coma and I can say with certainty there’s only one thing I would do differently: wear better walking shoes. Dubrovnik became really popular around 5-6 years ago and has only increased in popularity since becoming one of the main shooting locations for HBO’s Game of Thrones. This city is as pretty as a postcard with an idyllic location on the seaside – a combination that can’t be beaten! Despite being the capital, Warsaw is not the first city many travellers think of when visiting Poland. I too had fallen into this trap and considered Krakow the only city I desperately wanted to visit on my first time in the country some ten years ago. As it turns out, Warsaw is just as (if not more) beautiful to explore and has a wonderful old town that comes to life over the Christmas period. Reykjavik was much smaller than I expected but also more beautiful than I could have imagined. The people in particular are extremely friendly and proud of their nation, eager to learn where you are from and what brought you to Iceland. Wandering the streets on foot is the best way to get around, just be sure to allow yourself to get lost – as this is where the magic happens! This list would not be complete without Venice, one of Europe’s most visited and sought after cities to visit. The sinking city is said to have a time limit in place, so be sure to make it a priority if you want to see it before it goes! When I arrived in Antwerp I wasn’t sure what to expect because quite frankly, I hadn’t heard a thing about it. As it turns out this was one of my favourite cities to discover in Belgium: full of young people, extremely fashionable and fun to ride a bike around. The city centre is beautiful to stroll around and you could spend at least a couple of days doing just that. London will always be one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and there’s no denying it has earned its title as one of the world’s most visited cities year after year. For the royal fans (myself included) there is much to see and do in support of the royal family, or you can simply spend a few hours walking the streets of Mayfair pretending to be posh (not a bad way to pass time if you’re so inclined!)

81,"For whatever reason you find yourself visiting Paris, a cheeky cocktail or two are surely destined to find their way into your plans. The city of light, Paris, really comes to life after dark. And I don’t know about you, but we are quite partial to a carefully crafted cocktail, especially when it is inside a swanky bar in one of the world’s sexiest cities. So, what are you waiting for? These are the best secret bars in Paris, according to us. This small and charming bar has an unexpected appeal and it comes in the form of technology. Once seated, diners can order their drinks right from their table with the built-in ordering system that not only will quench your thirst, but also offers games (in case your date is not going so well) or a call bell should you wish to converse with a person. The drinks list is fun and inventive, with the likes of a Jamaican Manhattan being on offer. Location: 20 Rue Vignon, 75009 Paris, France Pigalle is home to many fun bars but Maison Souquet is the swankiest destination to pull up a chair. The bar is characterised by its plush velvet lounges, dimly lit tables and a unique blend of sexiness-meets-sophistication. The interior design plays up the red light history of this neighbourhood, with moorish accents and an emphasis on decadence. The cocktail list is named after ladies of the night, with Celeste being a favourite pick of ours(whisky, spiced maple syrup, and bitters), thanks for coming! Location: 10 Rue de Bruxelles, 75009 Paris, France Inside a dimly lit room exists Le Ballroom du Beef Club, a classy bar with an inventive cocktail menu and designer digs. Open from 7:00 pm every day of the week, this is a great place to arrive early to avoid disappointment and perch yourself for a few hours of people watching. Location: 58 rue Jean Jacques Rousseau, Paris Home to some of the best Mexican food in Paris, Bar Candelaria is a guaranteed good night if you’re looking to mix food (tacos) and drinks (oh hey tequila!) All of this set inside a nostalgic bygone era background makes this one of our favourite places to perch ourselves with a small group of friends. Or, if you’re traveling alone, don’t be afraid to grab a seat at the bar and make some new friends while you’re here. Location: 52 Rue de Saintonge, 75003 Paris, France Contrary to what the name of the bar suggests, No Entry does, in fact, welcome patrons. As one of the more secret Paris speakeasies, however, not too many out of towners know it exists. The bar is located underneath one of our favourite French restaurants, Pink Mama, where you can be sure to bump elbows with the who’s who of Paris. Location: 20bis Rue de Douai, 09 Paris Shop now"
82,"With the world’s best pizza, colourful houses that charmingly line the cliffs and beautiful beaches to let the hours pass you by, the Amalfi coast is one of Italy’s most loved holiday destinations and it is hardly difficult to see why. For first time visitors to the Amalfi Coast, below you will find a complete guide to the towns and islands to visit during your stay to make this trip one of the most memorable of a lifetime!  What more is there to say about Naples other than it is the birthplace of pizza? Obviously there is a lot more that could be said, but really this is the most prevalent reason visitors flock to Naples – to sample all the many incredible pizza offerings. For a full guide to Naples pizzas (or at least, my fave picks), here is a list of where to get the best pizza in Naples.  Sorrento is the first town travellers come to when visiting the Amalfi Coast and thus a popular place to base yourself, as the hotel offerings are plentiful and it is easy to reach the rest of the Amalfi Coast towns from Sorrento. This town is also a little more active than other parts of the Amalfi Coast as it is both a resort town as well as home to many locals, so it would be my preferred town for night ambience and restaurants, especially if you are visiting during the low season. See here for a weekend guide to Sorrento.  Capri is the Amalfi Coast’s most popular island and for decades has been the favoured holiday destination of affluent travellers. The prices are sky high both for accommodation and restaurants, but the good news is you can still visit Capri during the day to avoid the price dampener – just pack a picnic lunch! For those who don’t have a budget, by all means, head for Capri! It doesn’t get much more glamorous than this. Read more: A Quick Guide to Capri.  Positano is for me the pick of the Amalfi Coast towns. Incredibly picturesque and impossibly charming at every turn, there really is no way you could come to Positano and not enjoy your time here. We visited during Spring when the flowers were all in full bloom, arguably making this the best time of year to visit before the summer crowds arrive. Read more: A Quick Guide to Positano.  One final town that cannot go without mention is located just beyond Positano and named after the area itself (or vice versa); Amalfi. This is the final town on the mainland of Italy that is regarded as a must see when visiting the Amalfi Coast and while charming to the eye, it isn’t nearly as picturesque as nearby Positano (however both are great to visit). Amalfi is located approximately 40 minutes from Positano and most easily accessed by the SITA bus (which also connects the rest of the Amalfi Coast). Just be sure to buy your bus tickets in advance from local caffe bars or look out for the black and white “Tabacchi” sign out the front. From Sorrento, I would also recommend taking a bus, vespa or car to visit nearby Ravello, located a short drive up the hill and offering sweeping views of the coast. This town was a hidden gem!  Of all the Amalfi Coast has to offer, the only two locations we did not get a chance to visit during our time there were Ischia and Procida. I really wish we had more time to visit these two as well(but even if we had have spent a month there, it still would not have been enough!) But alas, the show must go on! Here’s a little break down of what to expect when visiting the two other islands on the Amalfi Coast: Ischia and Procida. Lying approximately 30 kilometres off the coast of Naples is Ischia, a volcanic island that boasts thermal spas, hot springs and volcanic mud. The island is sizeable enough to spend at least a few days here, though you can also visit by day ferry from Naples. Said to be the best kept secret of the Amalfi Coast, Procida flies under the radar compared to its neighbour Ischia and further afield Capri. Colourful buildings line the bay and with little tourist visitation, the experience in Procida remains a much more authentic offering to those willing to go somewhere a little more off the beaten path."
83,"As the capital of Catalonia and Spain’s second largest city, Barcelona is one of Europe’s most thrilling cities to visit as a tourist. Barcelona has a unique identity not emulated elsewhere, partly due to the influx of early 20th-Century artists who made their mark on the city – most notably Antoni Gaudi. His designs, mostly seen on building exteriors, are mesmerising and a huge drawcard for visitors to the city. This city is also a mecca for food lovers, with endless options on offer for every budget. If you are planning your visit to the city, here are the absolute best things to do in Barcelona. Shimmering in blue, green and every interpretation of turquoise, Casa Batlló is one of the most celebrated Gaudi architecture pieces in the city of Barcelona and my personal favourite. The exterior is influenced by nature and as such possesses no straight lines (as Gaudi himself noted nature does not possess any). Despite the grandiose of the building, the details are intricate and can leave you perplexed in awe. Not many masterpieces in Europe remain unfinished, however visitors flock to La Sagrada Familia day in and day out to get a look at this incredible basilica that is hands down one of the most visited attractions in Barcelona. You can buy your Sagrada Familia entry ticket online to secure your visit. I would strongly recommend booking the major attractions in advance as Barcelona becomes very busy over the summer months and this is no exception. Park Güell feels a lot like a fairytale you stepped inside of, especially if you book a sunrise or sunset viewing time (yep, you’ll have to book in advance!) Because of the popularity of Park Güell visitors must book in advance and will be allocated a time slot for their visit. One of the least popular times when I was booking was at sunrise, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise as this is one of the most magical times of day to enjoy the park and the views. If there’s just one market you need to go to during your time in Barcelona, it is La Boqueria. It is one of the oldest markets in Barcelona, dating back to 1217, and has never moved from its location on the busy street of La Rambla. Be prepared for sensory overload: from the stallholders shouting for your attention to the wafts of everything fresh – seafood, fruits, baked goods… you name it, they sell it. A city where you can enter a mountaintop theme park and enjoying sweeping views over the city? Yes please! Tibidabo is a great place to spend the evening as it is open until 9pm and offers a great vantage point to take in the sunset. Barcelona is even prettier from above, especially if you time your birds eye view with a golden sunset that lights up the terracotta rooftop colours. Arguably the best view is on board a helicopter, though if your budget does not allow you can also get a great view from the Bunkers of Carmel viewpoint, a local’s favourite. Built in the early 20th century and the last private residence designed by Antoni Gaudi, Casa Milà is an impressive display of modernist architecture and another fan favourite whilst exploring Barcelona. Because of its functionality, it has been hailed Gaudi’s most iconic civil work of art. The city of Barcelona is a gastronomy lover’s dream and nowhere does this come more to life than at El Nacional in the heart of Barcelona. I only heard about this restaurant from my local friend David who insisted we go and I’ve since returned thrice. You can’t come to Barcelona without making your way to Las Ramblas, a tree-lined pedestrian street filled with different sights and sounds with every step. Be sure to hold your belongings close, this is also the most popular spot for pick pockets in Barcelona! Another highlight of Barcelona’s location by the seaside is how much of the city lifestyle operates around Barcelona’s city beaches. The beach is just a stones throw away from the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, but feels a world away with its own flair and identity. If you’ve got more than a few days in Barcelona then you might consider making a day trip out of the city to nearby Montserrat. This incredible mountain range is only a short train ride from Barcelona and has quickly become the most popular day trip from the city. You don’t need to join a tour to visit, simple use the public train system to make your way there. For a city with beautiful architecture at street level, the views only get better from above. Barcelona is home to a handful of great rooftop bars, many that are hard to find or often unheard of. One of my favourite finds is upstairs at the Mandarin Oriental, at the casual Terrat restaurant focusing on delicious small portion Peruvian cuisine. The drinks are punchy and the views are next level! Housing one of the most extensive collections of his works, the Picasso Museum in Barcelona is a must visit for Pablo Picasso fans. In a city that prides itself on local cuisine, Barcelona does not fail to disappoint. Every night food tours of the city embark on a foodie feast around the city. This was one of my favourite memories from my first trip to Barcelona, as it acted to both satisfy my palette and serve as a running history of the city from my guide! If you’d rather go on your own accord instead of joining an organised tour, simply make your way to the lively neighbourhood of El Borne. It is here where locals and visitors mix together in a bar hopping fashion, each person making their way from one bar to the next. There are no particular bars you should frequent, just try them all! From taquerias specialising in tequila to hearty Catalonian meals, there’s something for everyone. This post is written in partnership with Klook who offer endless tours and entrance tickets to every major city in the world."
84,"Belgium is full of hidden gems and Antwerp is no exception. This is Belgium’s second biggest city and commonly regarded as the capital of cool. It has a much more curated feel than the capital (Brussels) and a strong focus on art and fashion. Winter in Antwerp is cold but there are huge benefits in visiting off season. We were fortunate enough to experience Antwerp in winter this year. The best part about our visit: no crowds! The city of Antwerp is busy through the summer months, much like the rest of Europe. In winter the days are shorter, meaning you can indulge in a sleep in and make the most of a cozy hotel in the city. For our time in Antwerp, we checked in to De Witte Lelie. Your first port of call should be the Antwerp Main Train Station. This is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful train stations in all of Europe – so much so that I would recommend you stop here just to see the train station, even if you’re not planning a stop in Antwerp itself. The belle époque style is truly mesmerising and the details are second to none. The Antwerp Bell (also known as Den Bell) is worth a climb if you’re looking for something a little more active yet still indoors, especially for this spiral staircase. Another favourite thing to do in the colder months in Antwerp is visit one of the many independent book stores. This city feels like a living history itself, but this becomes even more prevalent when you step inside one of these bookstores. This book store is housed inside a 14th-century building on Hendrik Conscienceplein square. The store is filled with second hand books and has been one of the best book stores to visit in Antwerp for two decades. If you’re like me and love a bookstore that is as aesthetically pleasing as the collection it holds, then head straight from Copyright. There are plenty of coffee table books to peruse and many of those centre on art, design and fashion. One of my favourite reasons to visit Antwerp is how fashion represents a part of history in Antwerp. The fashion museum MoMu (Mode Museum) is a great representation of this and certainly worth a visit to escape the cold. For this winter escape to Antwerp we stayed at the beautiful De Witte Lelie hotel. This hotel is somewhat of a secret and design lover’s paradise. The quirky combinations of textures and colours make it one of my favourite design hotels in Western Europe."
85,"There are endless adventures on offer when visiting Europe. From a romantic railway journey through the Rhine to an epic discovery of culture through the Baltics. But not all adventures in Europe are known equally. If you’re looking for something off the beaten path, we have listed the best-kept secrets in Europe for you. These are the most underrated destinations, cities, towns and experiences in Europe you should be adding to your itinerary. If you want daily travel inspiration, follow along on Instagram. Romania is by far one of Europe’s most underrated destinations. Lying deep within the Carpathian mountains you will find untouched landscapes and endless views. Plus, you will find my favourite castle in all of Europe. It is located near Sinaia and goes by the name of Peleș Castle. This neo-Renaissance castle gained international attention when it became the film location for binge-worthy Christmas film A Christmas Prince.  Read more: Visiting the real life “A Christmas Prince” Castle Slovenia is a small country in Central Europe known for its mountains, ski resorts, and lakes. And the most famous lake of all? That is of course Lake Bled, Europe’s most romantic lakeside town. Lake Bled is the most photographed and most famous lake in the country. Ideally you would spend a week in Slovenia passing your time between the capital, Ljubljana, Lake Bled, and lesser-known sites. There is surprisingly a lot to see in this small landlocked country! Read more: This may be the most romantic lake in the world Another reason to visit Romania is this small quintessential Eastern European town. Brasov is a great place to start your adventures in Transylvania. It is within driving distance of popular Dracula’s Castle, which is the perfect day trip. Read more: 8 Places you must visit in Romania If you drive just a few hours from Paris you will arrive in Burgundy. Or if you prefer to sit back and watch the world pass you by, a train takes just two hours. So, what is there to see in Burgundy? Beaune is my favourite choice. This small town is packed with so many beautiful boutiques, patisseries and Michelin star restaurants. There is a market on Saturdays where you can stock up on stinky cheese and vegetables! Read more: The Fairytale French Town: A guide to Beaune, France Thanks to its endless fjords and a list of outdoor adventures on overdrive, Norway is full of hidden gems to discover. If you find yourself in the southwest of the country you will find the small but quaint village of Flåm not to be missed. Flåm is idyllically situated at the end of Aurlandsfjord, a branch of the vast Sognefjord. Read more: Visiting the Norwegian Village of Flam If you’re visiting London and looking for an escape to the countryside, you cannot go past a road trip to the Cotswolds and in particular, a visit to Bibury. This small English town is as pretty as a postcard and if you can chance some sunshine, one of the most beautiful day trips from London! Read more: Visiting the Cotswolds Croatia has quickly become one of Europe’s most sought after destinations, particularly when Game of Thrones put Dubrovnik on the map. But there is so much to discover in Croatia beyond the Adriatic coastline and one such place is the capital itself – Zagreb. Distinguished by its 18th and 19th century Austro-Hungarian architecture, the city is often overlooked by travellers making their way to the coastline but skipping the unique culture and effortless style of Croatia’s cities. Kiev (or Kyiv) is the capital city of Ukraine and still to this day one of the most fascinating cities in Eastern Europe I have visited. Long before Russia was Russia and Ukraine was Ukraine, Kiev has been a prominent city in the East of Europe and as such, has an abundance of culture and with so many conflicts and revolutions, the city has a lot of history to discover. St. Sophia’s Cathedral (pictured) is the cities’ oldest standing church, dating back to the early 1000’s. Read more: 20 of the most charming places in Eastern Europe Founded in 1920, Kylemore Abbey is an oasis in the midst of an oasis with the West Coast countryside of being one of the most beautiful road trip destinations the world over.

Read more: 10 Things you Must Do in Croatia Although it is a far cry from an underrated destination (Prague is easily one of the most popular cities in Central Europe), the vegan scene in Prague remains relatively unknown to foreigners. When I first travelled to Prague five years ago I was shocked by how forward thinking the city was – with plenty of vegetarian and vegan restaurants on offer. Some of my favourites include Lehka Hlava, Maitrea, and Dhabas Beas. Read more: Where to Eat Vegan and Vegetarian in Prague The capital city of Poland is often overlooked by travellers opting for a quick trip across the border to visit Krakow in the south of Poland (and for good reason – Auschwitz is unmissable). But Warsaw is a unique city in itself and well worth a visit. The old town of Warsaw has been rebuilt to reflect its’ former self, given Warsaw and all of Poland’s constant turbulence as it has passed hands through time. Such turbulence has led to a unique blend of architectural styles – from gothic churches to neoclassical palaces to the Soviet-era communist blocks, there’s a lot to discover in Warsaw. Read more: Spotlight in Warsaw, Poland While many history classes focus on the history of aristocracy and royalty in Western Europe, there’s a fascinating history in the East to be discovered and as a bit of a nerd on the topic, I’m a little biased toward history in the East and in particular Russia (or the Soviet Union as it were). Some of my favourite places I have ever discovered include the Hermitage Museum (Peter the Great’s winter palace in St Petersburg) and Peterhof (Peter’s summer residence). Read more: St Petersburg Bucket List! How can an entire country fly under the radar, I hear you ask? Malta is quickly becoming one of the most on-trend destinations to discover in Europe thanks to the influx of interest in this archipelago in the Mediterranean. The country has been ruled by the Romans, Moors, Knights of Saint John, French and British, giving it an extremely unique history that is evident from centuries of overthrows and subsequent architectural styles and cultures that have created the Malta that exists today. Read more: A Day Trip to Gozo, Malta If there was one capital city to take the cake of Europe’s most underrated capitals, it would have to be Ljubljana (pronounced: Le – yoob – le – ah – na). This tongue twister of a capital city has all the charm of a small town with all the benefits that come with a big city inside a compact area. The city has a strong green identity with many beautiful public parks and the celebrate Tivoli gardens. In the spring this city carries as much charm as the likes of Paris or Annecy, but with the added benefit of less crowds, affordability, and being a perfectly compact city to wander around on foot in just one or two days. Read more: How to spend one day in Ljubljana With so many Greek islands to choose from it can be difficult to choose just one… but the good news is you don’t have to! Hopping around the Greek islands is the best way to experience this destination and one of the best underrated islands is that of Skopelos, which quickly hit fame when it was used as one of the filming locations for the Mama Mia film in 2008. Nowadays the island has moved on from its’ Hollywood moment and circled back to being one of the quieter Greek islands to visit but with all the charm an understated destination can bring. Read more: A Guide to Skopelos If you haven’t yet visited Vienna then you’re missing out on a nostalgic trip back to the glamorous 1920’s when coffee houses were the centre of intellectual discussion, entertainment and where you would find the who’s who of Europe. Cafe culture in Vienna has maintained its charm and charisma from these days, despite becoming more of a phenomenon over the past few years. Cafe Schwarzenberg and Cafe Sperl are two of our top picks to avoid the crowds of out-of-towners and get a real feel for the Austrian capital’s cafe culture.

It soon became one of my favourite European cities and to this day, is one of the most overlooked.

86,"If there is any other city in Europe quite as alluring as Amsterdam then I’d love to hear about it. Amsterdam has all the charm of a small town with all the benefits of a large city. So if you’re visiting Amsterdam for the first time, you’ve come to the right place. We have listed all of the iconic things you must see and do in our complete Amsterdam bucket list.  The origin of fries has long been contested but one thing is for sure, the Dutch do frites really well. Frites in Amsterdam come in a few different ways, however you can’t miss the opportunity to try the traditional dutch way: topped with peanut satay, mayonnaise and onions. Visit Vlaams friteshuis vleminckx for the best in town.  Nothing could be more iconic than to cruise the canals of Amsterdam, which is undeniably what has made this city so famous. The canals create a real homely vibe to the city and despite its size (and continued growth) the charm of Amsterdam rings true.  A visit to the Anne Frank House is an absolute must for first tine visitors to Amsterdam. The museum is informative and touching – a strong reminder that in order to change history, we need to understand it.  Arguably the best neighbourhood in Amsterdam and full of charming boutiques, Jordaan is a great area to spend a few hours on foot. The cafes and boutiques come and go but the charm of this neighbourhood remains the same.  Of all the beautiful stores and boutiques in Amsterdam, none caught my eye more than Helias Fogg, a playful take on Around the World in 80 days. This store is full of beautiful travel trinkets – compasses, world globes, maps and beautiful gifts to take home. Read more: 12 cool stores to visit in Amsterdam  If you go to just one museum in Amsterdam, make it the Rijksmuseum. The exterior of the building is just as impressive as the collections inside and the library is really something else.  For Van Gogh fans, there really is no way you can come to Amsterdam without stopping in at the museum which hold’s the largest number of his works.  One of Europe’s most famed street artists, Invader, has made his mark on Amsterdam. Whilst in Amsterdam I only managed to find one of his works but my sources tell me there are more!  I can’t believe it took me three visits to Amsterdam to finally try a Stroopwafel. These delicious treats consist of two wafers sandwiched around caramel sauce and are as delicous as they look. Try Van Wonderen for a stroopwafel covered in your choice of decorations!  Located on the edge of a canal, the flower market is enjoyable throughout the year but especially more so in tulip season.   There is no denying Van Stapele Koekmakerij have the best cookies in Amsterdam and I’ll bet no local will contest me on this! These delicious cookies are baked fresh all day and best enjoyed warm.  Amsterdam is a real mecca for vintage lovers and thrift savvy shoppers. Episode is the most central choice, however there are some great alternatives on the fringe of the city.  The newest museum on the scene, MOCA is home to a curated selection of works by contemporary, modern and street artists. You can expect to see the likes of Andy Warhol and Banksy on permanent display, with additional exhibitions on offer depending on the time you visit.  Do as the locals do and hop on two wheels to make your way around the city for the day. Just don’t run anyone over and stick to the bike lanes (trust me, it happens!)  Still one of the most enjoyable things to do in Amsterdam is to walk at leisure through the canals. Be sure to watch our for cyclists passing by, they show no mercy for the tourists!  Amsterdam has endless options for luxury boutique hotels, however the Pulitzer has got to be one of the top choices. This beautiful design hotel is located on the fringe of Amsterdam’s famous 9 straats, a conglomerate of shopping streets in the centre of the city.  If you’re visiting Amsterdam for a few days or more, you might wish to stumble upon some more local stores. Jordaan is a great area to find concept stores although you can’t go wrong by visiting Hutspot. Read more: The Best Bookstores in Amsterdam  When you’re travelling for a longer stint in Europe, there’s no better word than “free” to grab your attention. There are free Amsterdam city walking tours daily if you’d like to get a better history of the city with a local (which is often an expat but hey).  Do as the locals do and meander the local bar scene in Amsterdam. Sure, “cafes” are a must try whilst in the city that lets you smoke, but the bar scene is just as fun to peruse. My favourite is the lobby bar at the Andaz Amsterdam on Prinsengracht. Last but not least, be sure to make your way over to the 9 streets to pop in and out of local boutiques, concept stores, cafes and more!

87,"Peterhof (meaning Peter’s Court) was built by Peter the Great in the 18th century. It was built to be his summer residence, located a short distance from his city-based winter palace. Of course, you may now already know this as the Hermitage Museum. Or perhaps you haven’t arrived in Russia yet and still learning the way of the land. Whatever the case, here is your guide to visiting Peterhof, one of my favourite attractions in St Petersburg. Peter’s summer residence is a lavish display of gold fountains, carefully manicured hedges, lush lawns and extravagant fountain displays… and that’s just the gardens! The palace is one of St Petersburg’s top attractions, best visited alongside the likes of the Hermitage Museum (Peter’s winter residence) and Catherine’s Palace. Each of these three palaces has its’ own unique history to be discovered, but with so much to see and so many visitors to share the grounds with, here is your complete guide to make the most of your visit to Peterhof or Petradvorets as it is also known. The lower gardens are one of the main features of a visit to Peterhof, with thanks to Peter the Great’s playful additions of “trick” fountains amidst an otherwise structured and well-manicured garden. The gardens were designed to reflect 17th century French formal gardens and thus consists of formal clippings, trimmed hedges and marble statuary. Be sure to locate chess mountain to the East and the prominently positioned fountains of Adam and Eve. A visit to Peterhof is a must when visiting St Petersburg, but the confusing hours of operation can be deterring at best. Here’s a complete break down of the hours of operation per season: Admission fees are similarly confusing but the easiest way to break it down is below: Upper Park – free Alexandria Park – free Lower Park – approx. $8 USD Palace – approx. $15 USD There are separate admission fees for Monplaisir, the Catherine Wing, Hermitage Palace and Cottage Palace. Getting to Peterhof is either simple and expensive or cheap and complex. The hydrofoil runs to Peterhof from St Petersburg and though this is the least confusing option, it is the more expensive. Alternatively you can choose to bus, minibus, train or metro."
88,"Viennese coffee houses are so important to Austria’s culture that they have quite literally shaped the history of the country and its’ place in European history. It was in these coffee houses that writers and thinkers would congregate to discuss change and controversial subjects. Today, coffee houses are as popular as ever and have become one of the cities’ main attractions. Below are our top picks for the 6 best coffee houses in Vienna!  If I could pick just one coffee house in all of Vienna to spend half a day people watching it would be Cafe Schwarzenberg. This traditional coffee houses has long been a favourite of artists and musicians and has one of the most photogenic interiors without too many crowds. Kärntner Ring 17, 1010 Wien  Running at a close second is Cafe Sperl near Naschmarkt which is a little bigger and a little further out of the centre of town, meaning it is more of a local spot and a great place to avoid crowds. This is located in the artists’ district and is a wonderful area to walk around on any day of the week. Gumpendorfer Str. 11, 1060 Wien  Although it is packed with a line at nearly any hour of the day, Cafe Central is a must visit at least once in your lifetime. The interior is spectacular and the cakes are surprisingly good! Thanks to its’ central location you must be prepared to wait (it is very popular!) Herrengasse 14, 1010 Wien  Another favourite cafe located in the 1st District and thus very central to visit any time of day is Cafe Landtmann. They also have a really great (and extensive) food menu, making this our top pick for a proper meal beyond coffee and croissants. Universitätsring 4, 1010 Wien  If you just want sweet treats then look no further than Demel, one of the most famous chocolate brands in Austria that attracts crowds on crowds every single day. Kohlmarkt 14, 1010 Wien  Last but not least, Cafe Prückel is a great option for a local hot spot with much fewer tourists on the edge of the 1st District. The interior decor is so different to the more traditional coffee houses, with a bit of an understated approach to design. The cakes are also probably the best when comparing to the other coffee houses!"
89,"Croatia has quickly become one of the must visit destinations in Europe and it isn’t hard to see why. Tourists have ditched nearby Italy and Greece in recent years, opting for this up-and-comer. While it has officially come of age in the tourism sector, Croatia still has some offbeat travel destinations you’re probably yet to hear about. Here’s our complete list of the 10 best places to visit in Croatia! We’ll start with the famed old town of Dubrovnik, which rose to popularity during the filming of HBO’s Game of Thrones series. Since then Dubrovnik has been a must visit destination on the Adriatic Coast. While it is certainly worth a visit for a day or two, the mass crowds and influx of tourists has made this city a bit of a tourist trap (which is putting it lightly). So if this is your first visit to Croatia, swing by Dubrovnik. But don’t make it your only pit stop! Hvar is the second most popular city on the coastline of Croatia. Known for its beaches, historic old town and the Pakleni islands, this is a great city to base yourself for a few days. It isn’t as spoiled as Dubrovnik and it serves as a starting point for visits to outlying islands. As far as beaches go, Zlatni Rat would have to be one of the most beautiful locations in Europe. Also known as the Golden Horn, this beach is an iconic top spot in Croatia and gets busy during the summer months. The capital city of Croatia, Zagreb, is often overlooked. Landlocked and far from the coastline, many travellers skip the capital for the beaches and islands Croatia has become so famous for. But don’t let statistics stop you! Zagreb is a great city to explore, especially if you are interested in Croatian culture, history, and best of all: food! Plitvice National Park became famous alongside instagram and its as if this destination grew up with social media. It has long been a favourite for local Croats, but nowadays is bustling with tour groups and adventure travellers alike. The waterfalls are truly something to behold and well worth a visit if you’re exploring more of Croatia beyond the coastline. Another popular city on the Dalmation coast of Croatia is Split. This city is large, busy, and another great gateway to the outlying islands. Split is known for its beaches and the fortresslike complex at its core. With the mediterranean climate, this best time of year to visit is through the summer months. Located within the Krka National Park, Visovac Monastery is in one of the most idyllic locations of the Balkans. The island is home to the 15th-century Franciscan Monastery of Our Lady of Mercy. Located on the tip of Croatia’s Istrian Peninsula, Pula is a beautiful city that is often overlooked by travellers. The city is known for its Roman ruins after it has been occupied, destroyed and rebuilt numerous times. Back in the Dalmation region of the country, Omiš is at the mouth of the Cetina River. The town was known for being home to pirates in the 13th and 14th centuries, giving this town endless history to discover. This fishing port on the coastline of Istria is one of the more relaxed places in Croatia. Istria is commonly considered the best kept secret in Croatia and once you visit, you’ll see why!

90,"With some of the most influential history in the modern world, the centre of the Roman Empire is a world of discoveries in itself. Ancient and aesthetically pleasing, the city of Rome is full of photographic opportunities every which way you turn. Here are the most instagrammable places in Rome to create snaps that will transport you back to Roma and la dolce vita for years to come!  After a recent revamp, the Spanish Steps in morning light is hands down one of the most beautiful places in all of Rome, especially at sunrise. Thanks to the unique design and lavish display of blooms in Spring and Summer, the steps have long been a favourite for artists, painters and poets. Tips for the best photos: Sunrise is the best time of day to photograph the steps without crowds.  With my local friend to show me around (Simone from Access Italy), we hit up some of the best bars and restaurants in Rome during my short three day visit. My favourite time of day is of course sunset (who doesn’t love a good sunset!?), so we made our way to undoubtedly the best viewpoint in town at Terraza Borromini. Tips for the best photos: Book a table for sunset as far in advance as you can, this place is a hot spot!  While we were cruising around town between sights and attractions, I spotted one of the most gorgeously framed photographs out the right hand side of the vehicle and asked our driver to stop. From Di Ponte Umberto you can capture so much of Rome in one photo – the river tiber, one of Rome’s many domed churches and another of its many bridges, Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II. Tips for the best photos: Descend the stairs toward the river for this exact framing!  The centre of Ancient Rome itself: you can’t come to Rome and not visit the Roman Forum! A sprawling display of ruins, there’s a lot to be learned if you have a guide with you. We visited with Access Italy for an insightful tour of what remains today and what once stood at what would have to be one of the most iconic sights in Rome. Tips for the best photos: The lookout overlooking the forum is the best view and can easily be enjoyed without crowds in your frame at most times of the day.   Easily the most famous fountain in Rome, the Fontana di Trevi is a must on every traveller’s list when visiting Rome for the first time. So the legend goes, if you throw a coin in your right hand over your left shoulder, you will ensure a return visit to Rome. After three visits, I’m still throwing coins to make sure I come back to what would have to be one of my favourite cities! Tips for the best photos: The best time of day is by far to visit at sunrise. Be sure to arrive 10-15 minutes before the sun actually rises to secure a good spot and set up your shot.  Nothing says Rome more than the Colosseum – so be sure to visit at least once, but probably a few times for varying perspectives. There is nothing quite like standing at the base of the impressive structure at sunrise and having the whole thing to yourself, but you will of course need to return later in the day for a tour inside! Tips for the best photos: Sunrise, sunrise, sunrise!  Last but not least: perhaps the best view of Rome is to be found atop Pincian Hill. Tips for the best photos: Allow some time to explore the gardens nearby, you won’t be disappointed! "
91,"There’s never a bad time to visit Paris but if you ask me, there is no better time than Paris in winter. For the past 8 years, I have been traveling to Paris each year, completely besotted with the city of light. Each year I try to learn a new skill, mostly centered around food with the likes of macarons classes and breakfast pastries being skills I am proud to say I have mastered. If you too would like to make the most of your visit to Paris in winter, this guide has all the information you could ever need. From where to stay, play, cafes you cannot miss and so much more: this is your complete guide to Paris in Winter. What makes Paris so special in winter, I hear you ask? Well, it all starts with Christmas. This is undeniably the most magical time to be anywhere in Europe, but especially the cities of Paris, London, and virtually any city or town in Germany (Christmas markets, duh!) But the beauty of Paris in Winter is that it doesn’t stop on the 26th of December. Christmas markets will begin late November so the entire month of December you can expect to find the Christmas spirit. After Christmas, the magic lingers a little, with ice skating rinks, hot chocolates, and the famed January specials. My all-time favorite arrondissement to stay and spend time is Le Marais. There’s something so endlessly charming about this part of town and it starts with the number of small boutiques that give it a real local feel. Some of my favorite hotels are here too and best of all, they’re affordable by Paris standards. I found this little gem when I was looking for a nice but affordable hotel in Le Marais. This was the best option on the table and I loved it so much that I have since been back twice. Book with the hotel Francep, 30 Rue de Turenne, 75003 Paris, France If you have the budget for a little luxury, you can’t beat Le Pavillon de la Reine, located right opposite the Place des Vosges. I stayed at this hotel on a work visit and completely fell in love with the homeliness. It is more expensive and sits within the 5 star category, so perfect for a special occasion! Book with the hotel 28 Place des Vosges, 75003 Paris, France Now that you’re settled into your hotel, exploring Paris in winter is what it’s all about. Don’t be discouraged by the sudden drop in temperature, there are many different ways to get around the city. The easiest way to travel around Paris is by metro. If you plan on doing a lot of exploring in one day, purchase a day pass. If you’re just heading to one destination and back, single tickets are the best way to go. If you have purchased data for your trip to Paris then another great way to get around the city is by electric scooter. The scooter craze has totally taken over the city of Paris and truly it is one of the best ways to get around! A ride will cost you anywhere between 2-10 euros for a 10-40 minute ride. Simply download an app (Lime was my weapon of choice) and off you go! The first pit stop is outdoors but is entirely worthwhile in the winter. The Palais Royal is perhaps my single most favorite photo location in Paris. The installation of black and white columns is just the beginning – what until you see the morning light hit! It is best to get here right at sunrise which in winter is around 9:00 am. 8 Rue de Montpensier, 75001 Paris, France The next stop is very nearby and another one of my favourite locations in Paris to take photos. The Palais Garnier (Royal Opera House) is a complete time warp. You can step back in time and appreciate not only the creation of this masterpiece but the culture it created in Paris. It was not until the Palais Garnier that the famed Parisian boulevard was born. Be sure to opt for the audio guide as this is one such location really worthwhile learning about. Place de l’Opéra, 75009 Paris, France Open Mon – Sun 11:00 – 14:30 Another attraction nearby is the world famous Louvre museum. Museums are a great way to stay warm during winter and if you’re visiting outside of the Christmas/New Years period, you can enjoy much less crowds than a summer visit to Paris. While the Louvre pyramid is essential to see on your way, the better entrance is underground. An easy way to get there is to enter the Louvre metro station. Open Wed – Mon, closed Tues Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France Across the Seine is my favourite museum in Paris. If you’re a lover of contemporary art, be sure not to miss Musee d’Orsay. I would recommend at least a few hours here, followed by a hot chocolate at Angelina (listed below) or a walk through nearby Saint Germain. Open Tues – Sun, closed Mon 1 Rue de la Légion d’Honneur, 75007 Paris, France One church you absolutely cannot miss on your itinerary is a visit to Saint Chapelle. The stain-glass inside the church is the most beautiful I have seen the world over and when the light hits, it brings the entire room into a kaleidoscopic daze. Open 7 days a week 8 Boulevard du Palais, 75001 Paris, France Once you’ve got the main attractions out of the way, be sure to add a few pit stops in your journey and visit these boutiques/book shops while in Paris: Although it is the busiest little book shop in Paris and overrun by visitors to Paris, I’d still recommend visiting Shakespeare & Co bookstore. There’s no good time to visit in terms of dodging crowds, however weekdays are noticeably less busy. Read more: Where to find the best Book Stores in Paris 37 Rue de la Bûcherie, 75005 Paris, France Open 7 days a week Just around the corner is another English book store that is not nearly as famous but equally impressive. The Abbey Bookshop was opened by a Canadian who clearly has a love for literature (you’ll see what I mean when you step inside). The Abbey is just a few minutes walk around the corner. After you’ve visited both stores, drop in to Les Deux Magots or Cafe de Flore for a coffee. 29 Rue de la Parcheminerie, 75005 Paris, France Open Mon – Sat, closed Sun Over in the 11th arrondissement is my favorite concept store in Paris named Merci. Every time I have visited I have been incapable of leaving empty-handed, though it has certainly picked up in popularity this last visit. If you’d rather shop in peace, visit first thing in the morning. 111 Boulevard Beaumarchais, 75003 Paris, France Open Mon – Sat, closed Sun No guide to winter in Paris would be complete without mentioning the famed Angelina chocolat chaud. The hot chocolate at Angelina is famous the world over and if you love chocolate, you absolute must try it. Just a heads up however, it is definitely one of those “love it or hate it” vibes. I personally love it. Read more: A full review of Angelina Paris 226 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris, France Open 7 days a week If you’re not the kind of person who likes drinking liquified chocolate, make your way to one of the Carette locations for a softer alternative. Carette also have the best salted caramel macarons in all of Paris. The Place des Vosges location is my favourite though if you aren’t over in Le Marais, visit the Carette right by the Trocadero (Eiffel Tower). 25 Place des Vosges, 75003 Paris, France Open 7 days a week Perhaps my favourite secret of Paris is the shopping passages. These passages a walk back through history, when shopping was an elegant affair inside these beautifully decorated passages. Below is a list of my favourite hidden passages in Paris: This is my top pick of the hidden passages of Paris as it is surely the most beautiful. The corridor comes to life in the sunlight, creating a warm atmosphere even in the winter! 5 Rue de la Banque, 75002 Paris, France Open Mon – Sat, closed Sun With a train themed restaurant that will have you believing you have stepped inside a Harry Potter film set, Passage des Panoramas is one of the most visited passages in Paris. Arrive early to have it to yourself. 11 Boulevard Montmartre, 2nd arrondisement Located in the 9th arrondissement, Passage Jouffroy is home to some really beautiful small boutiques and niche stores. It is located virtually opposite Passage des Panoramas, so great to visit immediately after. 10 Boulevard Montmartre Boulevard, 9th arrondisement Read more: A full guide to the Hidden Passages of Paris The WOW Guide to Paris"
92,"Ljubljana has some great coffee shops. It came as a welcomed surprise to me that some of the best coffee shops in Ljubljana were reminiscent of what you’d find back home in Australia. Here’s a list of tried and tested coffee shops in Ljubljana for your coffee fix in Slovenia’s capital. If you’re looking for a coffee shop in Ljubljana that isn’t trying to do anything more than great coffee, look no further than Stow. The interior is casual and Stow isn’t following in the footsteps of other cafes by trying to be something else. If you’d rather ditch the Instagram-friendly jaunts and are looking for a casual vibe, this is your go-to. The team are really passionate about great coffee, so it is a bit more of an experience and coffee education than just straight up cafe. Address: Gosposka ulica 15, 1000 Ljubljana This is one of the most popular spots among the locals, so a great place to mingle and mix in. The coffee on offer is fair trade and there is a strong sense of community here at Tozd. This is the kind of joint that will become your local in no time. Address: Cankarjeva cesta 15, 1000 Ljubljana Moderna lives somewhat of a double life. Located inside the Modern Art Museum, Moderna is a relaxed cafe by day and by night often switches to party mode for exhibition parties. The coffee is perhaps the best in the city (my almond milk iced latte was reminiscent of my days in Los Angeles). The service is really friendly and it feels unfussy. Oh! And there are a great range of design magazines and books to flick through. Address: 1000, Gallusovo nabrežje 27, 1000 Ljubljana Named by the street it resides on, Kavarna Soteska is a beautiful combination of mix-matched chairs inside the art hotel. They make great coffee and are pretty friendly! Address: Soteska 8, 1000 Ljubljana This list would not be compete without Cafe Čokl, a small and unassuming little place that delivers some of the best coffee in town. With a focus on fair trade imports, this cafe is guaranteed to make you feel good about where your coffee is sourced. Furthermore, they make their own organic beer! Address: Krekov trg 8, 1000 Ljubljana"
93,"Travelling throughout the Netherlands on a whirlwind week of adventures, I finally arrived in Utrecht. After visiting The Hague, I made my way by train to Utrecht, a city that has come to be known by many as “Amsterdam’s cool little sister” as quoted by a local. And indeed, I think it might be my favourite city in the Netherlands! Here is how to spend 48 hours in Utrecht if you’re planning a visit.  The best way to experience Utrecht is not necessarily to “see” the city, but to “do”. The city of Utrecht doesn’t offer much by way of must see attractions, as the whole charm of the city is purely in experiencing it. With plenty of great coffee shops and bakeries, there’s a lot to begin discovering! De Koekfabriek – at the cookie factory you get free cookies with your coffee. Ummm yes please! Carla’s Conditorie – located right behind the dom is one of the cities’ cutest cafe/bakeries with a hint of Scandinavian flavour. The Village Coffee – said to be the best coffee in the entire city. De Bakkerswinkel – I first discovered this little gem in The Hague and was delighted to see it again in Utrecht! A very cute old school bakery with great (and huge) breakfasts.  From the centre of town you can explore all that Utrecht has to offer, which is predominantly centred around the cities’ canals. The city is full of cheap eats, al fresco restaurants, boutiques and the usual chain brands you’ll see everywhere in Europe. The best way to discover Utrecht is to begin on foot around the city centre, later renting a bike when (and if) you feel comfortable navigating the streets to explore more of the neighbourhoods on the fringe of the CBD!  Figuring out your place in a city is often a task that takes a few days to master, but the city of Utrecht has one main attraction that is better experienced sooner rather than later. The Dom Tower Climb is an absolute must when in Utrecht and will give you a much better understanding of the city from above. Climbing the tour is by guided tour only, lasting 60 minutes total. There are 465 steps to climb (yup!) so make sure you wear your comfy shoes before you commence your climb of the highest church tower in the Netherlands. The climb begins at the Tourist Office and you can purchase tickets on the day.  The city of Utrecht comes to life in the evenings when the canals reflect the buildings and their light. Be sure to wander late into the evening to really get a feel for this city – there’s a lot to discover in the cobblestone alleyways!  Although they began in Amsterdam, I discovered the Frites Atelier in Utrecht and my goodness what a find! These fancy fries are as good as they sound with house-made sauces like “Deep Truffle”, “French Bernaise” and “Indian Curry”. There are also flavour specials like “Indo Peanut” to discover, which come with fried onions, peanut sauce, rempejek and lime zest. Life made. For research marketing purposes I made it my business to try another frites shop in town: Frietwinkel. This is more of a traditional offering and a really popular choice for locals. The only downside was the minimal sauce (though I am someone who has more sauce than fries most of the time!) This bakery is originally from Amsterdam but I loved it so much I had to give their Utrecht store a mention. They specialise in meringues, cookies, and traditional Dutch sweets (like stroopwaffle). In need of a pick-me-up? I’ve got just the answer for you! The best poffertjes (dutch pancakes) in town is said to be had at De Oude Muntkelder. These pancakes are covered in icing sugar and full o’ goodness (by no means sugar-free or anything free)!  Free cookies at the cookie factory!  A healthier dinner option from SLA (vegetarian and vegan)  Sometimes I get a little (way) too excited about tourist attractions you won’t find elsewhere in the world, like the “Miffy Traffic Light”. I only learnt on arrival that the creator of Miffy was a resident of Utrecht, making Miffy a celebrity of the city!  On my last afternoon in Utrecht, I made a mission out of riding my bicycle to De Haar Castle, an apparent 50-minute ride out of Utrecht. With many wrong turns and failed attempts at gear changes, I made it there in around an hour (okay, maybe a little more). The castle closes at 5:00 pm in the evening, so be sure to around before 4:00 pm if you plan on going inside. The entrance fee is 10€ or for entrance to the gardens only it is 5€. Due to my late arrival I only had time to enter the gardens, but what I did see was certainly worthwhile!  For my stay in Utrecht, I checked in to Malie Hotel, located in a residential neighbourhood which gave me the perfect excuse to go complete “Dutchie” and ride a bike everywhere! The hotel offers rental bikes for 8€ a day, which seems like a pretty reasonable deal to get around. Walking to the town centre was a 20-minute trip one way, which gave me all the more reason to stop at my favourite ice cream shop on the way home every day! The buffet breakfast was really generous and if you’re after a nice hotel out of the city centre, this is a perfect choice.  A huge thank you to Visit Utrecht for welcoming me to explore the city and supporting my visit with endless recommendations and research! I loved my time in Utrecht – all opinions and photos are my own."
94,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, I could write a novel to describe the beauty of Switzerland. There is nothing more magical to waking up in the mountains, surrounded by snowy peaks and views for days. And if you are lucky enough to visit Switzerland, you will soon realise this small country hosts endless beautiful towns and cities to visit. So with that, we’ve listed for you the prettiest places in Switzerland to visit. Get pinning! I’ve been lucky enough in my life to visit Zurich more than once. However, it is my first visit to this city I remember most. Arriving in Zurich feels like a fairytale. The pastel-coloured houses, the scenic Limmat River, and the charming cafes all make this feel like a small town. But the truth is Zurich is a large city. It just feels quaint, charming and bespoke. This 13th-century castle is perhaps one of the most photogenic in all of Europe. Oberhofen sits peacefully on the edge of Lake Thun, providing an ethereal backdrop, especially in winter. This is a great place to visit if you’re looking to better understand Bernese culture, not too far outside of the city of Thun. Geneva is a city in the southern tip of Switzerland, heavily influenced by its French neighbour in both language and gastronomy. But the crowning jewel of this city is Lake Geneva, at the heart of the city. Given its location near to France and not too far from Italy, this is a great city to visit in between destinations. If you are coming from France, be sure to stop in Lyon! It is the leading city in French gastronomy and a great alternative to Paris. Anyone who has been to Lucerne will be quick to tell you it is the prettiest city in all of Switzerland. While they might be right, I would still argue they perhaps have not seen Zurich! But we all have our favourites. This compact city has a well preserved medieval architectural presence, making it as pretty as a postcard. Before I visited Zermatt, I had only ever hit the slopes once in Switzerland in a small town called Arosa. But where Arosa is unknown, Zermatt is commonly regarded as one of the best ski resorts in all of Europe. It is of course home to the famous Matterhorn, one of the most iconic places in Switzerland. The skiing here is fabulous and hosts a range of ski slopes for beginners through to advanced black diamond skiers. Another beautiful resort town that attracts many international visitors each year is Interlaken. This town is located in the Bernese Oberland region of central Switzerland and is too beautiful for words. Interlaken is surrounded by mountains, forests, alpine meadows and glaciers. There are also a number of hikes in the area, making it equally as enjoyable in the summer months. As a Francophile and someone who has a unique love affair with Germany, Basel is a top choice for me. The city of Basel is located on the Rhine River and very close to France and Germany. Ever since falling in love with Alsace in France, I’ve been obsessed with Franco-German architecture. Basel is Switzerland’s very own version of this. I didn’t realise Bern was the capital city of Switzerland until I was standing in it, chatting with some locals about its beauty. I was comparing the beauty of Bern to my favourite Swiss city (Zurich) when I finally asked: “Where is the capital city of Switzerland?” And apparently, I was standing right in it! The city of Bern is large in size, but the old town is incredibly quaint and romantic. Be sure to allow a couple of days to explore Bern as there is much to uncover! As far as ski destinations go, Saint Moritz is one of the most sought after. Celebrities descend on this Swiss alps city every year, eager to make the most of the ski season. And although it is expensive to visit, it is one of those destinations that stays in your heart for years to come. A lesser known ski resort that is equally as beautiful is Arosa. I had to really consider whether or not I would mention Arosa in this article, because it is one of my favourite Swiss secrets! The good news is it is more affordable than the likes of Saint Moritz or Zermatt, so it is a great alternative option. You will also find fewer crowds in Arosa and some beautiful chalets to rent. As one of the most quaint villages in all of Switzerland, Grindelwald is commonly considered the most beautiful postcard location in the country. But the magic doesn’t stop there! Grindelwald is also a great choice for beginner skiers, with many beginner and intermediate slopes. Located in Switzerland’s southern Italian-speaking region, Lugano is a great choice for travellers who like a blend of cultures. The mix of cultures is reflected in architecture and cuisine, as well as Italian being the most commonly used language."
95,"Its the most magical time of the year and if there’s anywhere to be during the month of December for that Christmas spirit you’ve seen in the movies, it is knee-deep in glühwein at the German Christmas markets. This year I made my way to Austria to experience all that Vienna has to offer through the month of December when the entire city comes to life in a stream of Christmas lights, nativity displays, Christmas markets and of course, the smell of Christmas trees, hot wine and roasted chestnuts fills the air. If you find yourself in Vienna for Christmas, these are the 20 things you must do to make the most of the festive spirit!  There are many Christmas markets dotted around the city of Vienna through the month of December and one of the best starting points is to visit Hofburg Palace with the few Christmas stalls at the entrance (we’ll save the best Christmas Market in Vienna for later – you’ve gotta work up towards it!) Hofburg Palace is one of the most central points to begin your adventures in Vienna and has the iconic romanticism I’m sure you’ve seen in postcards – it really is just as pretty in real life! Michaelerkuppel, 1010 Wien    Whilst you make your way around the Innere Stadt (1st District) in Vienna there is plenty to see and do and the best way to experience central Vienna is of course on foot so you can take it all in. Located directly opposite the Vienna State Opera House is this iconic building with a giant Christmas bow, which has become a pit stop for visitors to Vienna over recent years. Opposite the Vienna Opera House  This 1786 tea salon has built a name for itself as one of the finest tea houses in Vienna. They serve specialty cakes, tea, coffee, and a limited cafe style menu. This is a great place to make a pit stop during your Christmas shopping (there is upstairs seating) or to grab a few pastries to go for Christmas day. For something local, try the famous Sachertorte (the origins of which are contested between Demel and Cafe Sacher). Kohlmarkt 14, 1010 Wien  Still within the Innere Stadt, be sure to make your way to the Vienna State Opera House for a behind the scenes tour – priced at a fair 9€ and available on the hour (check the website for an update of tour times as they vary depending on performances). The tour will take you to many of the opera’s rooms including a backstage tour pending availability and you can ask as many questions as you like to learn the history of one of Europe’s most celebrated opera houses. Opernring 2, Wien Coffee house culture has a huge legacy in Vienna to this day and there is no single cafe more famous (and thus no longer line you will wait in) than Cafe Central. Although touristy, a visit once to this famous institution is mandatory for any first time visitor to Vienna and you’d be surprised at how great the cakes are despite the main customer base being out-of-towners! Herrengasse 14, 1010 Wien  Vienna is an absolute mecca for Christmas traditions and it all begins with the famous Christmas markets that draw in thousands of visitors to Vienna year after year. There are a handful of major Christmas markets around the city and also small pop-ups of stalls in every direction so be prepared to be spoiled for choice!  Austria is renowned for its’ hearty winter cuisine and even the desserts are based around those cold winters and staying warm! Apple strudel is the most popular Austrian dessert and can be found on almost any menu, however if you’re not much of a sweets person you can pick up a miniature apple strudel at Demel (near the Hofburg Palace) and sample a bite size strudel. Demel: Kohlmarkt 14, 1010 Wien  As beautiful as Vienna is by day, it is even more magical by night. The city of Vienna comes to life at Christmas and this is especially true when blue hour hits and the city lights up in all of its festivity.  There are many coffee houses to visit during your time in Vienna but if I could pick just one, I would recommend you visit Cafe Schwarzenberg as it is less chaotic and just as impressive as its’ more popular counterparts (i.e. Cafe Central and Cafe Sacher). Kärntner Ring 17, 1010 Wien  If there’s just one Christmas market you have to visit whilst in Vienna it is the Christkindlmarkt at Rathausplatz – the largest Christmas market that is ideally located in the 1st District. Because of its’ size and central location this is also the most popular Christmas market so be prepared for crowds! Rathauspl., 1010 Wien  If you’re looking for a Vienna hotel with a little extra Christmas flare then look no further than the Palais Hansen by Kempinski. Not only do they deck the lobby out with decorations on decorations but the concierge will even find some wrapping paper for you to wrap those last minute gifts and make sure you enjoy your Christmas in Vienna to its full extent. Schottenring 24, 1010 Wien  There’s much more to the Belvedere than Gustav Klimt’s celebrated The Kiss, but if we’re honest, it is reason alone for visiting! The Belvedere Museum is a great insight in to Austrian art history and there’s much to see and do inside the palace doors – however the gardens themselves are equally as impressive. Prinz Eugen-Straße 27, 1030 Wien  If you’re an art fan and looking for something to tickle your fancy outside of museums, be sure to visit Hundertwasserhaus in the Landstraße district. This is a great insight in to Vienna’s modern becomings and the cities’ quirkier side. Kegelgasse 36-38, 1030 Wien  Last but not least, you cannot miss a visit to Cafe Sperl and neaby Naschmarkt. This is by far my favourite neighbourhood in town and Cafe Sperl comes in at a close second to Cafe Schwarzenberg for me. They also have a much more extensive lunch menu with more to offer than traditional coffee houses, making it a great pit stop for lunch! Gumpendorfer Str. 11, 1060 Wien"
96,"Having been to Paris many times before, on this trip I decided to venture off in search of “old Paris” – the neighbourhoods, streets, cafes and boutiques in Paris that remain mostly undisturbed by modernisation and offer a nostalgic look at Paris’ golden days in the roaring 1920’s.  Keystone-France, Getty Images In France, the roaring 20’s were known as Années Folles, a period in Paris characterised by a revolutionised way of thinking, extravagance, joy and the art of socialising. It was in the 1920s at the close of the First World War when a lot of changes occurred in Paris. Women suddenly knew how to take care of themselves following their time being forced to learn how, the middle class were suddenly able to experience the same luxuries that were once only available to the privileged elite, and Parisians were all the more interested in aesthetic pleasures such as fashion and the artistic “Art Deco” movement. It was in particular fashion that really drove this desire to always be out of the house socialising, an act that women had previously not been accustomed to. All of a sudden women were wearing short dresses, cutting their hair, wearing make-up and perfume, and smoking in public. This of course gave them all the more reason to leave the house and show off their new threads, all the while admiring others’ and socialising with fellow Parisians which in turn allowed the city to really spring to life. So, where to find old Paris today?  The small island which houses Notre Dame Cathedral has always been a popular spot for Parisians and outside visitors who come to enjoy the summer sunshine. This cathedral is of course one of the most recognisable landmarks in the city, but little do most visitors know it is also where you can go off the beaten path to discover a few hidden gems that reflect Paris’ glory days. Wander along Rue Chanoinesse to discover cute cafes, continuing onwards to Île Saint-Louis for Paris’ best ice cream in typical old fashioned Parisian style at Berthillon.  Le Marais is about as classic as neighbourhoods come when in search of “old Paris”. This entire neighbourhood is full of fabulous finds in the small winding alleys, so be sure to get off the metro at Saint Paul (1) and simply wander without rhyme or reason. Carette is the perfect lunch spot to transport you back to the golden days, all the while enjoying a french pastry and people watching from your perch opposite Place des Vosges.  The whole neighbourhood of Montmartre (save for Boulevard de Clichy) allows you to transport yourself back in time to Paris’ glory days. The streets are lined with picturesque buildings, ornate Parisian balconies, small cafes, authentic local boutiques, and plenty of nostalgia at every turn. Be sure to drop by Café des Deux Moulins if you’re a fan of the film Amélie, as this is where the cafe scenes were filmed.  In the popular and affluent neighbourhood of St Germain you will still find a few cafes and vintage stores that allow you to take yourself back in time. Sure, some of them are so well known that you will hardly be able to hear yourself think let alone take yourself back in time, but still worth a visit nonetheless. Café de Flore is an obvious choice as is Les Deux Magots, but both will allow you to feel like a Parisian aristocrat if you avoid meal times and stop by for a coffee or chocolat chaud.

97,"Earlier this year, I booked a Gals Getaway weekend trip to Paris. I couldn’t have been more excited – just ask everyone that had to hear about it from the minute I pressed ‘approve payment’. However, that buzz rapidly turned to dread when the words my sister had uttered to me the year before echoed loudly in my head, “What about Paris?” You see, we had epic – and I mean truly foodgasmic – memories of our previous trip to Paris. You’ve heard the stories: the mouth-watering bread that magically reappears on your plate once devoured; the crêpe – buttery and delicious that draw you in with their sweet scent; and the outrageously delicious pastries handmade by talented pâtissières that transport you directly to dessert heaven. As this highlight reel played in my mind, I began to feel slightly alarmed. Those words continued to echo in my mind, and I really began to wonder, how on Earth can I ever be enthusiastic about going to Paris now? I wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve felt the same way. Or maybe you have even googled like I had, “Things to do in Paris that aren’t eating the most delectable foods in the word”. Well boy, do I have some thrilling news for you: Paris is the best city to be gluten-free in! Oh yes. I know you’ve gone back to read that again. You didn’t skip the word ‘not’ there I can promise you that. After I got over my incredibly dramatic tantrum, I decided it was my mission to truly revel in Parisian delights. My sister was easy to convince, she has come to learn gluten-free is not synonymous with distasteful. I wanted to hunt high and low for the coeliac-friendly gems I knew – okay desperately hoped – were hidden in this city. Additionally, I wanted them to be places that my non-GF travel companions would genuinely love, and not just refrain from whinging endlessly about going to for my sake. On our most recent trip to Paris, we completed some thorough research (aka a self-guided, overly indulgent food tour) and have compiled a list of the top 5 places to eat, enjoy and get those glorious French vibes. Here they are: Our first day in Paris I decided I was on the hunt for a croissant. We spent the morning searching high and low, and finally stumbled across a small sign reading ‘sans gluten’ followed by pâtisserie. I could barely contain my squeal and thought, here it is – the croissant I’ve been dreaming of! This was followed with a pang of disappointment when I discovered they were sold out. All pain was quickly forgotten as my head turned to catch sight of a delectable, smoothly-iced, caramel éclair. My mouth watered at the sight. We had a slow afternoon eating our way through cabinet and sampled: a tarte au citron, raspberry and pistachio cake, hazelnut and chocolate éclair and of course the caramel éclair that still holds a piece of my heart, Helmut Newcake is a gluten-free pâtissière’s (me) dream! Location: 28 Rue Vignon, Madeleine After my failure the first day to get my croissant, I filled my sorrow with a scoot around Paris and large serving of delicious crêpes! Aside from the sadness of thinking you’ll never eat a croissant again, crêpe make a close second. Luckily Paris is our friend and kind enough to have a few gluten-free crêperies so can enjoy the smell as you wander the city without being envious of everyone else. Culture Crêpes offers either sweet and savoury crêpes, which are perfect for breakfast, lunch or a late night dessert that you don’t want to miss out on! Location: 26 Rue Saint-André des Arts Waking up on our third day, I was still determined to find the croissant I knew was out there in Paris. Having heard people speak about No Glu, I decided it would be our next stop. We arrived at their cafe/bakery and were not at all disappointed. In my excitement I may have bought (and ate) way too much – but you know FOMO. We stayed for lunch and had a luscious Croque Monsieur. We sat where I could stare in awe of the cabinet filled with tarts, breads, baguettes, chocolate brioche, my lusted-after croissant and a (cheeky bonus) pain au chocolat. The croissant did not disappoint; it was warm, crunchy, buttery and flaky – it was a moment in heaven. We were so impressed that we decided to go to their second location: it was the best cheeseburger I’ve had in years! Location: 15 Rue Basfroi After maybe too many pastries (is that a thing??) we were after a proper meal. The search was on once again. We found Can Alegria, a Mediterranean restaurant with an abundance of gluten free options. It also hosted a fun cocktail list and great wines. It has the perfect menu for a dinner before a night out. With delicious starters and a large portion for mains – it was the hearty but not heavy meal we were craving. Location: 73 Rue Jean-Baptiste Pigalle And yummy it definitely is and as for guilt-free….I sure didn’t feel guilty about devouring 3 (okay 4) scrumptious waffles. I cannot comment on how healthy they actually are, but when you go, expect a 3-course waffle meal. Offering a variety of sweet and savoury dishes they have everything covered, including Croque Monsieur.

98,"I’m hot off the heels of my last visit to Amsterdam and I’d be lying if I said I don’t miss it already. Especially in winter, Amsterdam has an allure that other big cities fail to possess. The slow morning starts, warm glowing streets of Jordaan and endless canals to explore give this city a real cozy feel. On my recent visit to Amsterdam, I set off in search of the best concept stores, design stores, and small pastry shops to compile a list of my current favourites. Here are 12 of the best stores to visit in Amsterdam! We’ll begin with my handpicked selection of the three best bookstores in Amsterdam right now. All of these house English books (my native language) and a really great selection of new and old, as well as some difficult to source coffee table books. Located in the centre of town, this is one of the most frequented book stores by English speakers. Amsterdam has a large expat community so it is always busy with locals and tourists alike. The selection is great and the prices are fair. Address: Spui 12, 1012 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands I’m an avid reader and still prefer physical books (to the likes of kindles), so if I can I will always choose to purchase a second-hand book or borrow from a friend. This helps reduce your environmental impact and hey, it’s cheaper! This is a great book shop to score a bargain. Address: Kloveniersburgwal 58, 1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands This book store is great for artsy folk and the creatives out there. I found so many topics I was interested in just for the aesthetics and if I had a larger suitcase, I’m sure I would have left with the back right hand corner of the shop. Address: Berenstraat 11, 1016 GG Amsterdam, Netherlands This is a topic I was really eager to dive deep into on this trip to Amsterdam and boy did I come up with some goodies! Here are my favourite concept stores in Amsterdam: This is one of the OG concept stores in Amsterdam and one of the biggest in terms of choice. They house a lot of local designers as well as Nordic designers, so there’s a huge collection between fashion, books, homewares and the like. Address: Van Woustraat 4, 1073 LL Amsterdam, Netherlands I found this store during research for our trip and although it is a little out of the way (around 20 minutes walking), it is totally worth it if you ask me. The store is filled with mostly stationary and books, with a few random trinkets to round out your choices. I left with a Monocle book. Address: De Clercqstraat 130, 1052 NP Amsterdam, Netherlands This is one of the best known concept stores in Amsterdam and if you’re looking for a one stop shop, look no further. They have a huge selection and many of the choices are really affordable. Address: Utrechtsestraat 120, 1017 VT Amsterdam, Netherlands If you come to Amsterdam without many outfit choices, you can guarantee you will leave with a bag full. I have been living in Cape Town the last few months and only have summer clothes, so this is precisely what I did! Here are some of my favourite choices for clothing stores in Amsterdam housing local designers. We are Labels has one of the biggest collections of local designers and with winter sales in full swing during my visit, it was never going to be possible to leave empty handed. There are a few stores across town so you will likely stumble upon one during your explorations! Address: Raadhuisstraat 46-50, 1016 DG Amsterdam, Netherlands One thing is for sure when you visit Amsterdam: you will be spoilt for choice with vintage thrift stores! Episode is one of the most known stores thanks to its location within the 9 streets. They always have a huge selection but be sure to bring your patience, there’s a lot of sifting to go through those racks! Address: Berenstraat 1, 1016 GG Amsterdam, Netherlands If you’re more on the feminine side, Anecdote has a really great selection of girly clothes and accessories. Address: Wolvenstraat 15, 1016 EM Amsterdam, Netherlands With all that shopping you’re likely to need a mid-afternoon pick me up along the way. These are some great little cafes to stop in for a sugary treat and quick fix of caffeine: Whilst in the 9 streets be sure to drop by Pluk, one of the cutest cafes in town! They have a great selection of baked goods to choose from and the space is really cozy and inviting. Address: Reestraat 19, 1016 DM Amsterdam, Netherlands For (my fellow) lovers of natural light and fab interiors, be sure to drop by Hartje Oost. They make a mean espresso if you’re in a rush! Address: Javastraat 23, 1094 KM Amsterdam, Netherlands Here’s a great place to end your day and finish on a high note. Be sure to order the Apple Pie (and thank me later). Address: Weteringstraat 48, 1017 SP Amsterdam, Netherlands"
99,"Planning your first time in Europe is an out of body experience. There is so much history, culture and art to explore that it can be overwhelming. But there are a few destinations that really stand out for first-time visitors. I should know, I’ve had my fair share of visits to the continent! And if you find yourself visiting for the first time, these are the cities you absolutely can’t miss. If you are booking your first trip to Europe, you might be feeling overwhelmed by the choices. That’s totally normal! After all, there is so many great cities and countries on offer. My first piece of advice to first time travellers visiting Europe would be to choose less destinations and spend more time in them. This is the kind of continent where slower is better. There’s hardly a point in visiting Paris if you stop over for only a day. The capital cities of Europe are so filled with history and culture that you need at least a few days in each one. Another top tip would be to invest in a rail pass. This way you can cut back your travel time and enjoy the slower pace. Even though flights are often faster in travel time, you will spend a lot more time in transit. Hopping on a train is an easy way to travel and Europe is the best continent for it. Finally, if there is a “perfect time” to spend in a major cities, I would recommend four days (three nights). Any less than that and you will barely scratch the surface.  Western Europe is the most obvious choice for first time travellers. This is where the most iconic cities are and within them, so much history and culture. So, where are the best cities to visit in Western Europe? Paris is hands down my favourite city in the world. Every year I try to visit once to learn a new pastry skill, which serves as both an excuse to visit and a chance to feel French! Rome, the eternal city, is a must-visit for first-timers in Europe. As they say, all roads lead to Rome! Highlights include the Colosseum, Vatican City, and the Pantheon. If postcard perfect cities are more your style, you will enter a world of colour when you step foot in Barcelona. Gaudi architecture is sprinkled throughout the city and the tapas are to die for. Another favourite city of mine and my pick for the most romantic city in the world is Amsterdam. The city is built on canals and has a unique flair unlike any other city in Europe. It is certainly a top pick for first-timers! If Venice really is sinking, then what more reason do you need to visit! This city dazzles in the early evenings, especially in the summer months. Visiting in winter or shoulder season will ensure fewer crowds. If you’re looking for an adventure slightly off the beaten path but still with beautiful cities, head to central Europe. There is so much to offer in the heart of Europe and it starts with the blend of medieval, gothic and baroque architecture found in Prague. This city is amazing any time of year, with my favourite time to visit being winter. Another gem of central Europe is Budapest. For a long time, this city was considered to be flying under the radar but with its popularity in the present day, it has become a popular choice for first-timers. You will need at least three full days to explore this city. Finish the central Europe trifecta by stopping off in Vienna. The capital city of Austria is imperial and imposing in nature, with much to discover behind the facades. You will need four full days to experience all Vienna has to offer. Consider making additional stops in Salzburg, home to the Sound of Music, and Hallstatt, Austria’s idyllic lakeside village. You know the saying about something old, something new? Well, Berlin fits the bills to perfection. This city has a turbulent past, but it sure has promised a future. There is a lot to discover in this eclectic city – so much so that I moved there to live for three months! Even in that time I felt as if I only scratched the surface. If money is not an issue, Northern Europe has some of the most scenic cities to discover. You’ll need to be ready to embrace the cold if you visit in winter, but this is arguably the most magical season to visit Copenhagen. Give yourself at least two days in this city, but beware it is regarded as the most expensive city in Europe to visit! Stockholm has made a name for itself as the street fashion capital of Europe. Just one walk through the streets and you will soon see why! There are endless art galleries and museums to visit, but the old town itself feels like a living museum. For your first time in Europe, Helsinki might not be the most obvious choice. But I have always loved stopping over in the capital city of Finland, mostly because I find the flight connections more affordable. This city has become uber trendy in recent years, with some inventive young locals creating boutique coffee shops and pastry stores. Add to that, it is a great gateway city to Tallinn, Estonia. It is just a ferry trip away! Another great stop for cheap flights into Europe is Reykjavik. The capital city of Iceland offers cheap stopovers from the East Coast of the USA, making this a great addition to your adventure. You will only need a couple of days in Reykjavik to make the most of it, but at least another week to see the highlights of Iceland. Another great city for first timers in Northern Europe is Oslo in Norway. This city is a great gateway for a larger trip throughout the country. A road trip would be the most affordable way to see Norway, so you can go at your own pace and stay in smaller cities and towns outside of the ordinary. There’s no denying Eastern Europe is full of hidden gems. While it isn’t always the first choice for travellers in Europe, it is my personal favourite part of Europe to explore. If there is one city in Eastern Europe that most first time visitors to Europe visit, it is Krakow. This is, of course, the gateway to visiting Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps. Although it is a terrible moment in history, visiting is a sign of respect and you can really get a better understanding of what happened during World War II. The capital of Poland is Warsaw and if you make it all the way to Krakow, you might as well add this city to your adventure. It took me two visits to Poland to finally visit, but I’m so glad that I did. This city has had a turbulent past, having been torn apart and rebuilt again and again. Many travellers haven’t even heard of Riga, the capital city of Latvia. But this small city is such a hidden gem and as a bonus, there are some affordable flights connecting through Riga. St Petersburg is perhaps my favourite city in all of Europe (after Paris, of course!) As the old capital of Russia, there is a lot of aristocratic history here to explore. Start by visiting the Hermitage Museum and then look onwards to the Summer Palace. If it is your first time in Europe you absolutely can’t miss out on visiting the city of London. There are endless sights and attractions to keep you busy, so be sure to allow yourself at least four days in London. Edinburgh is one of the most underrated cities in Europe. If you find yourself looking to explore more of the United Kingdom beyond London, consider Edinburgh. This is a great city to visit for Harry Potter lovers, as there are many locations dotted throughout the city. This is where J. K. Rowling penned much of the first Harry Potter book! So, what are my top picks for your first time in Europe? Here they are: In Western Europe, I would recommend you visit Paris, Amsterdam, Rome, Venice and Barcelona. There are many more great cities in the West, but you will have a better time by visiting fewer cities and spending longer in each. In Central Europe, I would recommend you don’t miss Prague, Budapest and Vienna. These are known as the Central European trifecta and all located just a short train ride away from one another. In Northern Europe, don’t miss Stockholm and Copenhagen. These are two of my favourite cities in all of Europe! In the United Kingdom, the one city you cannot miss is of course London.

100,"Located East off the coast of mainland Greece is one of the countries’ less talked about islands, that is until the hit movie Mama Mia came to town for filming. Surprisingly this island is still one of Greece’ best-kept secrets (perhaps the hype has died down since the film was released). So if you’re looking for something less touristy and want to ditch the crowds, Skopelos is a great choice. Here’s my guide to Skopelos to help you make the most of your time here on the island.  Outfit details: Dress by Y.A.S., Sandals by Steve Madden, Sunglasses by Ray Bans Skopelos was the first port of call on my 7-day Seabourn Cruise through the Greek Isles. Although Skopelos is a large island to discover, with just one day to explore I concentrated my efforts around Skopelos Town, where most of the action happens. Arriving at the port, I began to climb the steep and winding staircase on the side of the church, which leads to views of a hidden beach below and ultimately arrives at one of the town’s best views. Here you will find a small restaurant offering juices, smoothies and light snacks (and also my favourite view in town – see below!)  Although a less visited island in Greece, that is not to say that Skopelos is without its’ own unique beauty to offer visitors. Without main attractions, the town of Skopelos is best explored on foot, without any destination or intent on arriving. Panagitsa of Pyrgos (the church built in to the cliffside as you arrive at the port of Skopelos town) offers a great view of the hidden beach and ocean below. This is one of 360 churches on the island of Skopelos, many of which have been privately built. Beach culture in Skopelos is still the most popular way to spend time, particularly in the summer heat that can soar to the likes of 40 degrees celsius. Agios Ioannis is the most popular choice of beaches, thanks largely to being a primary filming location for the Mama Mia! film.  If you eat just one thing in Skopelos be sure to make it a cheese pie, a local specialty that can be found in any snack bar. Stafilos restaurant offers one of the most impressive views if you’re planning a romantic evening out, with a strong seafood focus but thankfully some vegetarian options on offer also. Molos is a great choice on the shorefront, particularly if you’re after something more casual any time of day. Cafe Bar Thalassa is my preferred choice for a light bite, especially for smoothies and/or yogurt and the most incredible view (pictured above). "
101,"Paris has a reputation for its pricey restaurants however there are a bunch of cheap eats in Paris that should be on your radar… at least if not before, then now! There are dozens of delicious eateries and must-try specialties without the hefty price tag, you just need to know where to go. Here is a list of the top 20 must-try cheap eats which are as tasty as they are reasonable. Post updated August 2021.   On Sunday most of Paris closes, and so the crowds flock in their masses to the Jewish quarter, namely for the falafel.  The Middle-Eastern specialty comes overflowing in a pita with a generous portion of hummus, friend aubergine and spicy sauce if requested.  Locals pile through the doors and perch on stalls at Candeleria to satisfy cravings for authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. The tacos and marquaritas served inside are the real deal.  Baguettes warm out the oven, crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside are what carb dreams are made of. Liberty makes them come true with the baguette de tradition.  The French equivalent to the American cookie, the macaron has earned itself cult status and has quickly become the most famous sweet treat in Paris. For only a couple of euros, you can indulge in one for yourself.  When peckish, no snack fills the void quite like a crepe generously filled with ham and melted cheese. There are crepe stands dotted all over the city where you can purchase one for only a few euros. (Photo by Bruised Passports)  It’s said that the Parisian breakfast is one laden in carbohydrates, but it’s worth every mouthful. Enjoy a very reasonable breakfast of a simple espresso and flaky croissant, just as the Parisians do.  The sandwiches at Frenchie to go are really good value for money. The quality of ingredients and simplicity of the sandwiches have made this a very popular spot for locals and lunchers in the area. Get there early before everything runs out.  The ice cream from Berthillon is declared by many to be the best in France. It’s no more expensive than any other ice cream parlour but it is superior. Head to Ile St Louis where you’ll find dozens of cafes selling the celebrated ice cream for a few euros.  Parisians head to Berko for the two American classics: cheesecake and cupcakes. It has become known as the place to come to satisfy sweet cravings for Parisians and American expats alike.  If you want cake for your pennies then the towering lemon meringue pie at la Loire dans la Théière is the dessert for you. It’s the perfect balance of sweet and zingy and gets sliced into staggeringly large portions.  Sitting in the gardens of the Mosque in Paris is a lovely experience on a warm day with the birds chirping away. The best bit? They serve Moroccan mint tea and an array of pastries for a very humble price.  The pastries at this bakery have gained quite the reputation particularly the snails which now come in a variety of different flavours. Order a famed snail, or anything else you fancy and enjoy it along the Canal jut opposite.  Bob’s Kitchen is the place to come for homemade, hearty food. Everything on the menu is vegetarian, full of flavor and reasonably priced.  It might be a little pricey to sit inside the opulent tearoom, but a hot chocolate to go is a few euros cheaper and just as delicious.  Sweet doughy breaded bejeweled with sugar crystals is the brioche dreams are made of. Get the best brioche in town from Pralus along Rue Cler and eat it in the Champ de Mars gardens just a short walk away. The massive loaves are generously studded with homemade praline nougats and are so delicious that you won’t be able to buy the supermarket stuff ever again.  The restaurant Carette isn’t in itself very reasonable but the tartine on the breakfast menu is a real bargain. For only a few euros you get a humungous tratine served with curled butter and little pots of jam.  One of the best fast-food jaunts in Paris where you can get good old American classics such as hot dogs, bagels and fries. The food is comforting and the prices are cheap.  It has now become criminal to come to Paris and not try a signature éclair from l’Éclair de Genie. For a little over 5 euros, you get instantly transported to pastry heaven.  Soul Kitchen serve the best granola in Paris. It’s homemade, comes in a variety of flavours and once more is served in a generous portion making it the best value and by far the yummiest granola you’ll find in the city.  Our last choice for cheap eats in Paris is sushi – which Paris has become so famous for. Find amazing bento boxes and Japanese fusion food, head straight to Nanashi. The food served inside is filling and flavoursome and comes without a hefty price tag. Photography by WOW photographer, Faye Bullock"
102,"Is it your first time in Vienna? You’ve come to the right place. This list is a definitive guide to the best things to do in Vienna. From attractions to visit to local cuisine you can’t pass up, these are our favourite things to do in the city of Vienna! Not only is Vienna the capital of Austria, but it is also the cultural hub of all things Austrian. Cafe culture, Opera, impressive art collections and architecture are among the activities on your agenda. The city of Vienna has gained UNESCO World Heritage status to preserve its unique history. Some have even called it a prettier version of Paris! Begin your adventure at the Hofburg Palace , located in the heart of the city. This Baroque palace was once the principal imperial palace of the Habsburg dynasty rulers. Today, it is home to the Austrian parliament. From the central point you can verge off in any direction to find a plethora of cafes, restaurants and boutiques. The Hofburg is a great starting point to get your bearings and get a feel for the city. Guided tours take a couple of hours and I found it to be incredibly informative. If you’re a history buff like me, don’t pass it up! This is perhaps my favourite part about visiting Vienna. The cafe culture in this city has a long history dating back to the days of enlightenment when intellectuals would have secret discussions about their bold ideas. Today the cafe culture in Vienna is as strong as ever. The best part is, you still feel like you’re stepping back in time. There are opera houses and then there is the Vienna State Opera House. This was the first opera house I ever stepped foot in, back in 2014 when I spent a year travelling the world solo. Before my visit I thought operas were expensive and for older people but oh, how wrong I was! Here is our guide to getting cheap opera tickets for as low as €3! Schonbrunn was the residence of the Hapsburgs and is well worth visiting when you are in Vienna. The palace is grand and totally worth paying the entry fee as you will be given an audio guide to learn the entire history. You can easily get there via the Vienna subway system.  With all that walking, it is time to reward yourself with cake! The sacher torte is a famous chocolate cake and the story of its origins are just as famous. The cake was invented by Franz Sacher in 1832 for Prince Metternich in Vienna and has since been a favourite among Viennese and visitors alike. For the best sacher torte in the city, head over to Café Sacher. While on the topic of sweets, you can’t pass up the opportunity to fill your bag with snacks and sweets for your train journey departing Vienna. Demel is one of my favourite patisseries the world over and it is located right here in the heart of Vienna. If you time your visit in winter, be sure to try their famous hot chocolate. I have visited Vienna a few times now but nothing compares to Vienna at Christmas. Through the month of December, the entire city is abuzz with Christmas spirit and the heart of that spirit can be found at the many Christmas markets dotted around the city. You’ll be spoiled with mulled wine, ice rinks and all the sweets you can squeeze into your pants. Cafe Central is the most popular and well known of all the cafes here in Vienna. Although locals will tell you to give it a miss (granted it is full of tourists), I still say it is a must do on your first visit to Vienna. The cafe is right in the heart of town and has an old world feel to it. Plus, they have great cakes. Austria is a bit of an underdog when it comes to famous artists. One that I personally admire is Hundertwasser, famous for his use of curves and obsession with leaving out straight lines. The Hunderwasserhaus is a perfect living example of this – an apartment block in the suburbs of Vienna. While there aren’t as many attractions in comparison to the likes of Paris and Rome, one of the charms of Vienna is to just wander the streets at leisure. The Inner Stadt is full of old-world charm and history at every turn. If you love Vienna, chances are you will also enjoy nearby Prague, Budapest and Salzburg!"
103,"      Amsterdam centres itself around a glorious canal ring that presents the perfect opportunity to get lost. Make your way to each of these neighbourhoods to get a real local’s insight into the many personalities of this fascinating city! My Fave Hoods Jordaan – Easily the hippest hood of them all, Jordaan is full of quirky cafes, bespoke boutiques and a myriad of concept stores to work your way around. Oud-West – Outside of the centre of town, my favourite neighbourhood to wander around at leisure (particularly on weekends when the locals are too wandering) is Oud-West. The accommodation is a little cheaper here, making it a great alternative if you plan to cycle in to the centre each day (just don’t forget where you parked your bike!) A couple of my favourite eateries are here also, including the super hipster Vegan Junk Food Bar (which sells food as the name suggests). De Pijp – This neighbourhood centres itself around the most iconic market in Amsterdam; Albert Cuyp Markt, which operates daily. Around this area you will also find some of the best brunch spots in Amsterdam, including my personal favourite; Little Collins.  Read More: My Amsterdam Photo Diary   Small boutique hotels & Air BnB’s are where you’ll find the most authentic Amsterdam experience The Pullitzer Hotel – As one of my most memorable hotel stays the world over, I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Housed in old canal house mansions, the owners of the Pullitzer Hotel have been acquiring neighbouring real estate for decades and building an iconic luxe hotel with a uniquely boutique feel. The Dylan – Overlooking the Keizersgracht canal is this extremely swanky, NYC inspired hotel with a strong design focus. Both the Dyland and the Pullitzer share the forward-thinking approach to design in common, but The Dylan is a bit more of a secluded experience. Hotel Estherea – If you’re into old school luxe, check yourself into this time-warp of a hotel that literally feels like you’ve stepped back a century in the most grand of scales. Canal House – Another beautifully appointed central hotel is the Canal House, which is a little less swanky and a little more affordable. Rent a House Boat – Still one of the most iconic experiences to have in Amsterdam is to rent a houseboat and lives like the artists of the city historically have (though now, this is some of Amsterdam’s most expensive real estate!)

Expect a line but know that it moves quickly. De Drie Graefjes – charming little cake shop in the centre of town, down an alleyway that resembles diagon alley. Vegan Junk Food Bar – even if you’re not a vegan you will LOVE this place. Greasy vegan goodness awaits!

RESTORED COTTON CAKE Hutspot Droog       The only thing more hipster than Amsterdam is visiting its’ cooler cousin; Utrecht. The easiest way to visit Utrecht is by train (30 mins), but if you’re smart you’ll make more than a day trip of it as the hotel prices are a fraction of the price!

104,"Most commonly referred to as the City of Light, Paris has many nicknames but this one we know to be true – there really is no city more magical after dark than Paris! The nickname originates from reference to both the intellectual “light” of the city, having been a central hub for artists and creatives, especially through the 1920’s. However, the name also refers to Paris’ early adoption of street lighting, with the city being one of the first to switch from oil lamps to electricity in 1878. With so much romance and flair, this city is often considered even more magical after dark and we’ve got a list of the best places to see Paris at night – you’re welcome!  There’s no denying the Eiffel Tower is singlehandedly the most famous Parisian icon and there’s no denying it is even more beautiful in the evening as it lights the skyline of Paris. The sparkling lights on the Eiffel Tower are made up of 20,000 light bulbs (one-quarter of the amount on each of the four sides) and light the sky for five minutes every hour.  Ordered for construction under the order of Napoleon Bonaparte, the Arc De Triomphe is another of Paris’ most beautiful attractions, idyllically located on the Champs-Élysées. Both the Arc and the famous shopping street light up in an array of colours by night, making this one of the most beautiful places in Paris to visit of a night time.  Arguably the most beautiful bridge in Paris, the Pont Alexandre III comes to life during blue light, when the city is covered in a layer of almost darkness and the lights begin to reflect on the River Seine and allow the gold detailing on the bridge to shimmer too.  As the most famous museum in the world, The Louvre is a must-visit attraction in Paris, but have you seen it at night? Drop by the museum’s famous triangle entrance for an impressive glow of an evening, surrounded by the historic halls of The Louvre and the art they so magnificently house.  Montmartre is one of the most beautiful locations to watch the sun go down over Paris (specifically from Sacré-Cœur), but it is nearby at the Rue du Mont Cenis Stairs where you will get the most magnificent blue light, right before the darkness kicks in. To be perfectly honest the neighbourhood of Montmartre is not where I’d choose to spend an evening in Paris (it is quite grungy nowadays), but if you can manage to enjoy blue light here before darkness hits, you’ve just seen what I would say is one of the most beautiful settings in all of Paris.

105,"If you are lucky enough to find yourself in the capital city of Ireland, Dublin never fails to impress. The city of Dublin happens to be one of Europe’s most underrated capital cities and when comparing with the likes of Paris, London or Rome, is relatively affordable to visit. Here is your complete first time guide to Dublin to help you plan your stay and make the most of your visit. If you find yourself in Dublin on a weekend then you can bet your bottom dollar there will be plenty of fun things for you to do. Dublin is a city defined by its vibrance and variety, especially by way of bars and pubs to hop between! The most popular bar (and most well known) is Temple Bar, which is a great place to begin your first night in Dublin and see where the night takes you. It is no exaggeration that Ireland is extremely green and Dublin is no exception! Once of my favourite places in the city to relax, read a book and people watch is St Stephen’s Green. Although it is quiet and serene, St Stephen’s is in the middle of the city and easy to walk to. While it feels like Dublin’s Central Park it is nowhere near the size so you can easily navigate your way through the park without a plan! Another favourite place of mine in the city of Dublin is Trinity College. The university has a lot of history and is open to the public to wander around. You can soak up the atmosphere by walking around the grounds or if you choose to, you can also visit the Old Library with a tour. On each of my visits to Dublin I have checked in to The Merrion and it has quickly become my home away from home in Dublin. This inner city hotel is regarded as one of the most luxurious in the city, but what I love most about this hotel is how it has held on to its heritage. The Merrion feels like it is stuck in a time warp having paid tribute to its history by keeping the original elegance of the building both inside and out. You can read my full review of The Merrion here. Finally a visit to Dublin Castle will round-out your first visit to Dublin. Located off Dame Street, Dublin Castle is less a castle today as it is a government institution. The castle is free to roam around though if you would like to take a peak inside, there are set times for guided tours of the interior buildings."
106,"If there’s one village that says picture-perfect-postcard better than any other in Norway, it is Geiranger. This village sits at the end of one of Norway’s most beautiful and photographed fjords; Geirangerfjord. Whilst travelling through the coast of Norway we stopped in to Geiranger for just one day – though one day is better than none – to see why this fjord is regarded as a must visit for travellers exploring the fjords of Norway.  If UNESCO World Heritage listings are anything to go by, then you’ll be delighted to learn that Geiranger is not only on the list, but has also received a top score from National Geographic as a must-visit village and fjord in Norway. One of the best ways to arrive in Geirangerfjord is by water, as you’ll get to see how beautiful this narrow fjord is whilst passing through it to reach the village. We arrived in the early hours of the morning by cruise ship, however if you find yourself travelling through Norway by car, you can arrive by ferry from Hellesylt or Valldal.  Although a small village in size, there are plenty of great activities on offer in Geiranger, especially for the more adventurous traveller! For one of the best views in all of Norway, make your way along the winding narrow road that leads to this incredible (and free!) viewing platform. From here you can enjoy views of the town and fjord, though be aware that weather plays a key role in how visible your views will actually be!  Another very popular way to experience Geirangerfjord is to take a kayaking tour with one of the local providers, though be sure to check the days and times of operation in advance as each season brings a new challenge in Norway! Around the fjord, there are two main hikes that can both be reached in under an hour: Storseterfossen and Løsta. Both of these hikes offer rewarding views, however, be sure to wear appropriate footwear! The path gets quite slippery in winter and shoulder seasons.  For those looking to see more inland, I would highly recommend a day trip to Briksdal Glacier. Here you can choose a 1.5-hour hike (return) or a leisurely drive in a troll car to reach the glacier, which is the most accessible arm of the Jostedalsbreen glacier. Along the way you can see how much of the glacier has melted over the years – a great insight for climate change sceptics! Read more: The prettiest cities and towns in Norway After your visit I would highly recommend watching the Norwegian film “The Wave”. Not only is it based on previous events and events said by scientists to come true in the future, but it is also a very well made film. However, I certainly wouldn’t recommend watching it before your visit! See more of my adventures on Instagram."
107,"Stumbling across cheap and delicious food is a win on any given day, but especially so when you find yourself on the beautiful but outright expensive streets of Amsterdam. The good news is there are plenty of great street food stalls and hole in the wall friteshuis’ to discover, so without any further convincing, I present to you the best cheap eats in Amsterdam!  Hands down the best fries in all of Amsterdam and according to their sign, “The Best Frites in Holland”. While I haven’t tried all of the fries in Holland myself, I can say with certainty that these are some of the best fries I’ve had in my life. You can opt for the traditional “patatje oorlog” (fries topped with peanut satay sauce, YUM) or for any number of combinations (you can’t beat ketchup and mayo if you ask me!) Vlaams Friteshuis | Voetboogstraat 33, 1012 XK Amsterdam Price: €2.90 for a medium serve, €0.70 per sauce (cash only) Located on the Keizersgracht is a great little find for that in-the-know. This would be my first choice for brunch or breakfast in Amsterdam, and for an Australian who is spoilt for choice back home, that’s a pretty big call to make! The cafe is super accommodating for veggies and vegans, making this one of my top spots for cheap eats. (Hot tip: Greenwoods is also located on Singel canal). Greenwoods Keizersgracht | Keizersgracht 465, 1017 DK Amsterdam  Cheap and burgers are usually two words you’ll see together, but the good news is these burgers are good, too. When I stopped by Burgerlijk they had sold out of veggie burgers, but a local expat assured me these are some of the best burgers in town – or at least in the touristy areas of Amsterdam of which you are likely to find yourself on vacation. Check out their instagram for some drool worthy pics. Burgerlijk | Runstraat 1, 1016 GJ Amsterdam Price: €5.50 for a base burger, additional for cheese, sauces and frites I do love a resident cafe cat and at PIQNIQ you’ll be welcomed as a guest in Pedro’s home. Although the food is nothing to write home about (not bad by any means but nothing super special), I have to mention PIQNIQ for being one of the cutest little cafes in Amsterdam. This place is usually packed so be prepared to wait for a table if you come at peak times. PIQNIQ |Lindengracht 59 hs, 1015 KC Amsterdam  When I read online that this was “the best red velvet cake ever”, I knew immediately that I would have to go and check it out. While the red velvet cake wasn’t quite all it was cracked up to be, the hot chocolate gave me faith in the reasoning behind this cafe’s superstar rating online. Its cute, cheap, and full of cakes. What more could you need!? It is no secret this is one of the best cheap eats in Amsterdam. Thanks to my local friend for showing me! De Drie Graefjes | Rokin 128, 1012 LC Amsterdam Price: €4 for a slice of cake (which is so huge you’ll need a takeaway bag) Want cheap food that will fill you up? You can’t go past a hot jacket potato (seriously, who has ever had a bad one of these babies!?!?) Jacketz is home to just this and you’ll be sure to thank me later. The toppings are plentiful and generous – but best of all, its cheap! Jacketz | Kinkerstraat 56, 1053 Amsterdam  This place is beyond words. And it is no surprise I have named it one of the best cheap eats in Amsterdam. One of my readers (shout out to Taylor!!!) thought to take me here and I’ve gotta say, it was one of those meals you’re so happily confused about that you’re almost certain you will talk about it for months to come. Not knowing that vegan food could taste so good, I was pretty hesitant at first. How wrong I was. From burgers to cheese croquettes and all of the delicious deep-fried goodness one could imagine, this place was ridiculously tasty. The only down side? Vegan food will never taste the same again. Vegan Junk Food Bar | Staringplein 22, 1054 VL Amsterdam Price: €8.50 for a deliciously filling burger Pancakes, anyone? Here’s where you’ll find some of the best in town AND they’re cheap. Located near Vondelpark (which isn’t far from the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum) is this cute little pancake eatery that tastes as sweet as it looks. De Vier Pilaren | Stadhouderskade 11, 1054 ES Amsterdam"
108,"I’ve had the pleasure of checking in to more beautiful hotels than I can count over the last 7 years as a luxury travel writer. But just when you think you have seen it all, you discover a place like De Witte Lelie. This beautiful design hotel in Antwerp is a true gem. We checked in for a two night stay and based ourselves in Antwerp to explore more of Belgium. I had never even heard of De Witte Lelie when we began researching our trip to Antwerp. We had only a few days to stay and explore Belgium so we wanted to be based in a central location and Antwerp seemed like an obvious choice. I had already visited Brussels a few years before so I was eager to explore a new city. There are a handful of rooms each individually decorated, so much so that you won’t recognise one room from the next. Read more: 8 Places in Belgium you must visit What we loved about the hotel is that it is a short five minute walk from the Grote Markt and only a 15 minute walk from the main train station. Antwerp is a really safe city to visit so if you are arriving by train, I’d recommend walking to the hotel if you don’t have too much luggage. Taxis are readily available but the walk itself is quite nice and can sometimes be quicker with all of Antwerp’s one-way streets. Ours was room 10 in the attic of the house, with the bathroom being our favourite feature of the room. Each room is appointed with a help yourself mini bar (included), a television, bathtub and luxurious linens. All in all, it made for a really great home away from home. The hotel feels like a living design museum as you walk the hallways and find more corners to relax in. We could have spent a few more days here just enjoying the quiet corners of the hotel itself. Read more: 12 reasons to visit Belgium You can book online through the De Witte Lelie website. Room rates start at €340 per room, per night. Rates are accommodation only and there is no restaurant on site – however you’ll find some lovely restaurants in the heart of Antwerp. I’d recommend walking the city streets until you find something to take your fancy! Read more:  I visited De Witte Lelie as a guest of Hyatt hotels through an ongoing partnership with the brand.

109,"Loving pastries and loving Paris are two separate obsessions for me. So you can imagine my excitement when the two come together in unity! This Paris for pastry lovers article will help you make the most of your time in Paris. If you’re a pastry lover, pastry chef or amateur baker like myself, be sure to hit up these hot spots in Paris. Because believe me when I say that none should be missed! A huge multi-story cooking supplies store with absolutely everything under the sun for the pastry chef (or enthusiast!) I picked up some miniature tart pans here to make petit fours, and was mind boggled by the wide selection of shapes and sizes. There’s also plenty of copper, knives, and bowls the size of a sumo wrestler! 18-20 rue Coquillière, 1st arrondisement There are many more notable supply stores in Paris, but we’ve picked the best! This store is full of everything you could ever dream of in the world of pastry, plating and decoration. 13 rue Montmartre The perfect place to find French porcelain (and plenty of it!) 48 – 52 rue Montmartre Full of ingredients for pastry chefs, there’s a reason this little store is always so busy. You’ll find it in the 2nd arr. and will find it impossible to leave without a little something. 58 Rue Tiquetonne  Two of my days in Paris were devoted to my two favourite items of French pastry: macarons and croissants. La Cuisine offer a huge range of cooking classes (not just sweets), as well as walking tours of the best foodie tours. Price: €99 for 3 hour classes Book: La Cuisine Paris 80 Quai de l’Hôtel de Ville, 75004 Paris  I’ve said it once and I’ll say it ’til the day I die: the best macarons in Paris are at Carette! There are two locations in the city but my favourite is the Carette over by Places des Vosges in Le Marais. Don’t miss the salted butter caramel! Carette Place des Vosges & Trocadero  I’d be shocked if you disagreed with my claim, that Angelina has hands down the best hot chocolate in Paris (yes it is rich and yes it is sickly but its still so good!) Angelina, 226 Rue de Rivoli  A new favourite find from this trip to Paris was over in Le Marais, a small bakery on a corner that I noticed when walking by to my pastry class one morning. Au Petit Versailles is a really cute patisserie and super UNpretentious. Au Petit Versailles du Marais, 1 Rue Tiron, Le Marais  Finally on this trip I made my way over to Canal Saint Martin to visit one of the most highly regarded bread stores in Paris: Du Pain et Idees. Sadly they had sold out of pain au chocolat and croissants (my favourites), but whatever the hell this thing was was SO GOOD! Du Pain et des Idees (Bread & Ideas), 34 Rue Yves Toudic, Canal Saint Martin  Strolling around Saint Germain is one of the greatest pleasures in life – especially when it involves caramels as your final destination! Henri Roux has a wide selection of flavoured caramels and they’re worth every bite. Henri Roux, Saint Germain  You still can’t miss the classics: Pierre Herme, Laduree, Angelina… these are just the beginning!  "
110,"Paris is magical any time of year, but no season compares to visiting Paris in the Spring. Cherry blossoms, streams of sunshine, friendly locals before the summer crowds flock in… there really is no better time of year to visit Paris. On my recent trip to Paris with my partner we wanted to capture all the magic of Paris in the spring to share with you our favourite time of year in the French capital. Below you will find an endless stream of ideas for a spring time visit to Paris, including where we stayed, played, ate and got merry in the city of lights.  First things first: we arrived off the TGV from the countryside around lunch time, so our first mission was to find our hotel. A little tired from our travels thus far and eager to shed the layer of suitcases, we hopped in a cab and headed straight for our hotel instead of navigating the subway with our heavy load. We checked ourselves in to our home for the next few nights: Hotel Pavilion de la Reine, a gorgeous little boutique hotel in the Marais district – one of my favourite areas in all of Paris. This area is renowned for its great restaurants and lively night scene, so it really was an ideal position for us as we wanted to have the full Parisian experience during our stay. The exterior of the hotel is beyond mesmerising, but the room itself was spacious, well-appointed, and incredibly luxe feeling – just what you want for a magical weekend in Paris! This hotel is incredibly highly rated by guests and many return to the hotel year after year on visits to Paris, and after our few nights here it isn’t hard to see why. Although it doesn’t come cheap, it is much cheaper than other hotels I have visited of this calibre – so it is a steal if you’re looking for that quintessential Parisian experience.  On the day we arrived in Paris I had long in advance booked us a table to Plaza Athénée for afternoon tea, mostly because the courtyard just looks absolutely to-die-for. As a huge romantic myself, I had planned this long in advance as a surprise for my boyfriend who in all honesty would have been just as happy eating a croissant for lunch, but his face lit up when the elaborate afternoon tea setting arrive at our table! I’ve tried a few afternoon teas in posh Paris hotels over the years and I would have to say the Plaza Athénée wins for ambience and excelled food-wise as well.  That early evening we made our way with full stomachs and a spring in our step to the glittering gorgeousness of the Eiffel Tower. Just after sunset the tower lights up, so be sure to arrive right before sunset to experience both views – sunset and after dark. A glass of bubbles and a picnic rug will provide the best setting for two – and yes, its totally okay to drink in public in Paris!  Given our location in Le Marais district and the fact that we had both already visited Paris before, we picked a few spots to visit and stick to, instead of trying to see it all in our few short days here in Paris. Thus we found ourselves wandering the streets of Saint Germain des Pres, visiting a number of cafes on our afternoon walk and finishing our stroll in the Jardin du Luxembourg, before making our way to the Latin Quarter for a cheap and delicious dinner on-the-go. We also weren’t too far from Ile de la Cité, so made sure we had time to wander through here in greater detail. Previously I have overlooked this area beyond visiting Notre Dame Cathedral, so it was a delight to spend more time here. Make sure you don’t miss stepping inside Saint Chapelle and its newly restored stained glass windows. The church opens at 9:30am and to avoid crowds I would recommend visiting first thing in the morning.  Anyone who knows me or has been reading this blog for a while (thus I feel like you know me by now!) will know that I LOVE food. It is perhaps my single most favourite thing about travel and my preferred way to get to know a country. However being vegetarian I tend to stick to sweet treats as there’s nothing I can’t enjoy! Day eating is as important as anything when experiencing Paris, and my favourite spots from this trip include: Du pain et des Idees (for the best croissant in Paris & every flavour escargot for my boyfriend), Café de Flore (mainly for people watching), Berthillon (for the best ice cream in Paris), Pierre Herme (for Ispan + Isphan Croissant), L’éclair de Genie (for eclairs), Angelina (for thick hot chocolate + Mont Blanc!)  On our last evening we decided to head out for a romantic Parisian meal before heading onwards to a cabaret show. Because my boyfriend had never dined at a Michelin starred restaurant before, I took the opportunity to spoil him at Il Carpaccio, a one Michelin star Italian restaurant inside Le Royal Monceau. The meal was an absolute delight but the true highlight was the Pierre Herme dessert – my mouth waters just thinking about it!  Being a huge fan of live theatre, I decided to book a cabaret show for our stay in Paris as well. Having already seen Moulin Rouge and Crazy Horse years before (I loved both, by the way!) I decided to pick the best of the two and subsequently booked us in to Crazy Horse to see the new acts and because I loved it so much the first time. Thankfully it was just as good the second time round, though tickets don’t come cheap at nearly $150 AUD per person, so be sure to know what you’re in for before you book (the show is risqué but artsy and strikes a really nice balance between the two).  We flew to Europe with Emirates. Emirates flies to Paris multiple times daily from Dubai. Hotel Pavillion de la Reine is part of the Small Luxury Hotels collection, who assisted with accommodation for this trip."

112,"Moscow is a city that has completely intrigued me for years. The architecture is so unique and intricate, yet the city is so large and overwhelming that it exists quite cleverly as a paradox. With so much to see and do in Moscow, a visit should be no less than three or four days, though if you had a week here you would continue to be entertained by the many offerings… so what are you waiting for!? Here’s the complete Moscow Bucket List you need to start checking off ASAP!  As the capital of the former Soviet Union, Moscow holds a strong significance not just at present, but in modern world history as well. The Kremlin is a fortress that serves as the centre of Russian governance and houses an array of interesting museum collections, including the Armoury Collection, the Diamond Fund, several churches, and other points of interest. Be sure to arrive early as a guided tour is the best way to see the Kremlin and learn about its significance, and these fill up fast. The Red Square is at the heart of Moscow and could thus be considered the heart of Russia. This should be your very first stop in the city and from here you will be able to visit many of Moscow’s main attractions as highlighted on this list. The Lenin Mausoleum and St Basil’s Cathedral are here, with one of the Kremlin’s walls bordering the square. On that note, you absolutely cannot come to Moscow without setting your sights on St Basil’s Cathedral, and if you have time, stepping foot inside. Moscow’s Metro stations are a sight in themselves – decadent, opulent and entirely over-the-top. Be sure to use the metro to get around the city or, if you’re short on time, here are the best stations to visit: Novoslobodskaya Metro Station; Mayakovskaya Metro station; Elektrozavodskaya Metro Station; Shosse Entuziastov Station; Park Pobedy Metro Station; and Nakhimovsky Prospekt Metro Station. Back in the Kremlin, the most visited and most raved about collection is the Armoury; an impressive collection of royal clothing and chariots, mostly from the former Soviet period and WWII. If you’re wandering where to get the best view over the city of Moscow, look no further. This 18th-century Palace is home to impressive gardens and a museum full of antiques and fine art – a great pit stop for the art buffs! This is believed to be the most gorgeous garden in the entire city, so if you’re visiting in the warmer months be sure to stop by.  Located in the centre of the city, the Bolshoi Theatre is one of the most impressive in all of Europe and is home to one of the world’s best ballet companies. But if ballet isn’t your thing, you can also enjoy a night at the opera or enjoy classical music performances, depending on the season. If you want an old, classic, Russian establishment to kick back and enjoy a coffee or a spot of lunch, then you simply must visit Cafe Pushkin! Although it is mostly visited by tourists visiting the city, the authenticity of the old cafe is too good to resist. Old Arbat Street (pictured above) was one of my favourite and completely underrated spots to explore in Moscow. The street is lined with artists’ work as well as artists painting as you walk by and is great street to wander amidst your explorations in the city. Russian bathhouses (Banya) have been incredibly popular over the years and should you wish to see one operating in the present day or indulge in a little bathing yourself, be sure to drop by Sandunovskye Baths. As Moscow’s most famous shopping centre, GUM is an incredible display of Russian wealth and opulence. Although the prices are out of most shoppers’ budgets (myself included), a visit here is still worthwhile to walk the glitzy halls. Regarded as one of the world’s best museums, Tretyakov Gallery offers an incredible display of Russian art and would be my top pick if you were to visit just one museum in Moscow! Whilst in Russia it would be just plain blasphemy not to try the most famous local delicacy – vodka, of course! Drop in to any bar and you’ll be hit with an absolute mecca of choice… so be sure to try a few! Although it tastes as good as it looks to a Western palate (that could just be me!!!), Russian Borscht is a classic dish to try if every there were one. There are many different variations throughout Eastern Europe, so if you do fancy the purpley-pink soup dish, you have plenty of choices! The dish originated in Ukraine but is incredibly popular throughout Russia and will be available in most restaurants in Moscow.  One of my favourite buildings in Moscow and impossible to be missed from the Red Square, is the State Historical Museum (pictured above). Even if you don’t step inside, this museum is an incredible sight to the eyes and the intricacy of the building’s facade should not be missed up close! As both a convent and a fortress, Novodevichy remains incredibly well in tact for a building that was constructed in the early 16th-century! Located on the northern bank of the Moskva River, this particular cathedral is an incredible display of architecture (if you’re not completely over Cathedrals by now!) Standing tall at over 103 metres, this is the tallest Orthodox Christian Church in the world. Located at the Red Square, Lenin’s Mausoleum is an incredibly popular sight for visitors to Moscow and much of that is to do with the ongoing mystery: is it really him? If you want a great view over the city of Moscow you will sadly have to look elsewhere, as climbing the impressive Ivan the Great Bell Tower is not permitted (though imagine that view if it were!!!) Regardless the Bell Tower is quite impressive so is worth seeking out whilst in Moscow. If you happen to visit Moscow in the colder months you might be left feeling slightly disappointed by many outdoor attractions being closed… but one that won’t be is the (many) ice skating rinks throughout the city! The most popular of these is in Gorky Park. One of the most popular day trips from the city of Moscow is to the Golden Ring, a collection of small towns and cities that are home to a range of buildings rich in Russian culture and history. If you have more time in the city and would like to get out, be sure to make the Golden Ring your first choice or, if travelling onwards, be sure to stop by St Petersburg!  "
113,"When you think of the French capital you’d be forgiven for not thinking dairy-free deliciousness. France has an undisputed reputation for being the culinary king when it comes to great cuisine, however, the uncontested ingredient of choice here is butter. Lots of butter. In recent years the vegan food scene has really taken off in Paris, with many eateries that have started here already branching out to further locations across town and even internationally. Here is where you will find the absolute best vegan food in Paris!  This is hands down my most frequented vegan eatery in Paris. The burgers are unbelievably tasty and for around 8€, it’s a steal. “The Tourist” is still my favourite item on the menu, even if it is a bummer to order it in my terrible French accent and give myself away even further. 55 Rue des Archives This popular vegan chain is now all over the city, but thanks to a cheap and changing menu, remains one of the best options for a quick vegan-to-go lunch or dinner. 92 Boulevard Beaumarchais If you’re looking for a one stop shop you’ll find it here at Cloud Cakes with plenty of vegan pastries, buddha bowls, breakfast to go and a decent coffee. 6 Rue Mandar Vegan pastries are hard to come by in Paris, but there’s one place in Paris that will make your vegan pastry dreams come true. Laelo specialise in vegan sweet treats and believe me when I say it is worth going out of your way to make this a daily pit stop! 63 Rue de Faubourg  Now with more than one location in Paris and an international store in Dubai, Wild & The Moon has quickly become one of Vegan Paris’ biggest success stories. The location in Le Marais is always the perfect level of busy where there’s a great ambience, but you won’t wait forever for your meal. There’s also a wide range of takeaway lunch snacks, smoothies and juices in the fridge to grab and go. 25 Rue des Gravilliers For a change from the ordinary, stop by this late night vegan Vietnamese eatery in the 9th. The pho is as good as you’ll find in Vietnam itself and the service is always incredibly friendly and efficient. 13 Rue Rodier  Small and impressively so, Le Potager in the Marais district is a neighbourhood favourite. If you can manage to score a seat, this is one of my favourite spots in town to grab a lunch packed with goodness, all homemade in the tiny kitchen. 24 Rue Rambuteau Think about the best falafel you’ve ever had in your life, multiple it by seven and you have L’as Du Fallafel. The storefront says “recommended by Lenny Kravitz” but I think you’ll find it is recommended by just about anyone who has had the pleasure of devouring one of their falafel sandwiches. 32-34 Rue des Rosiers The WOW Guide to Paris"
114,"Travel is more accessible than ever and it sometimes feel impossible to stumble upon a hidden gem like Kotor. The old town of Kotor in Montenegro is just that: hidden inside a bay in the south of Montenegro and an absolute gem. Here’s how to visit Kotor Montenegro and make the most of your visit. The southwest coast of Montenegro has been dubbed the next big thing in luxury travel and for good reason. Characterised by dramatic mountain ranges, a beautiful bay and charming small villages, this is Europe as it should be. Kotor is the crowning jewel in Montenegrin tourism as it has become the most popular town to visit. You can arrive in Kotor by sea or by land. There are many cruise ships arriving in Kotor daily, so be sure to stay a few nights if you would prefer to enjoy the old town almost entirely to yourself once the cruise ships have left in the late afternoon. For a tiny town, there is plenty to see and do in Kotor over two days or you could easily stay a week and explore the region by car in a series of day trips. In Kotor itself, the main attractions are: Hike to the Castle of San Giovanni – Pack a bottle of water because the hike to the castle overlooking Kotor is a calf burner! The entry fee is 8 euros if you are hiking from the old town, or you can make a five minute detor to the “Kotor Fortress Trail” just outside of the city walls and hike for free (I’d recommend choosing the latter, it is around the same distance). Visit Kotor Cathedral – Once you’re back in the Old Town be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the Kotor Cathedral. After several earthquakes and reconstructions, the church is in great condition and a beautiful display of Romanesque architecture. Walk the streets of Old Town – The most enjoyable way to experience Kotor is to walk through the winding streets and see what you can discover on foot. As mentioned earlier, you don’t need to pay the 8 euros entry fee to hike to the view over Kotor. You can instead hike from the base of the “Kotor Fortress Trail” and about halfway up you will turn towards the castle of San Giovanni. You can take the same route down or walk down the traditional trail and enjoy the beautiful views as you pass all your fellow walkers who didn’t know the secret! Kotor sits at the foot of the Lovcen mountain range. If you’re up for an epic adventure, make your way up the winding road to Lovcen. The drive is incredibly scenic and ethereal. At the top you can enjoy sweeping views of the valley below. It feels as if you are standing on clouds! The price to enter the national park is €2 and the price for the mausoleum entry is €5. There are 461 stairs to conquer to reach the view so be sure to pack a water bottle! Warning: the road to Lovcen is narrow and winding in a series of hairpin switchbacks. It is not for the faint-hearted but totally worth it for these views! An alternative option if you’re not a confident driver would be to join a group day tour. Let me tell you a little secret. The beauty of Kotor lies slightly beyond the town itself, in neighbouring Perast. You can reach the small fishing village of Perast in just 20 minutes by car from Kotor. An alternative way to arrive is by bicycle if you’re looking for a full day trip! It is quite a long trek, but a very scenic ride."
115,"Dublin is one of my favourite cities in Europe and for one reason or another, flies under the radar on the main tourist circuit of Europe. The city is full of life with musicians on every street corner, in bars and pubs, as well as a lively crowd of locals and visitors mixing in the city streets. This is my second time checking in to The Merrion Dublin and it has quickly become one of my favourite hotels in Ireland, so I figured it was about time to share with you the magic of the Merrion! If a picture tells a thousand words it shouldn’t be hard for you to see how effortlessly beautiful and timeless this hotel is. It feels more like staying in the home of a long lost family friend! The restored Georgian townhouse has recently been restored to include an oversized spa and indoor swimming pool. I first stayed at The Merrion a few years ago on a short overnight passing through Dublin. With just one night in town I wanted to stay somewhere central that also felt homely and quintessentially Irish. The Merrion was the perfect choice. On this visit to Dublin I had a leisurely four days in the city and three nights to stay at The Merrion for a second time. Since my first visit the charm lives on and I wouldn’t want to stay anywhere else in Dublin. However much has changed with recent renovations to make this hotel the most luxurious in the city. I arrived to The Merrion after a gruelling four hour drive in the sporadic rain from the West Coast. I had been staying at the unforgettable Ashford Castle. The rain had cleared and my legs wanted to do anything but sit, so I dropped off my rental car on the fringe of the city and walked the 30 minutes to reach the hotel. Each of the rooms at The Merrion are individually decorated but what surprised me more was the size of the rooms. Not only are the ceilings high but the rooms are oversized with huge floor to ceiling windows. In summer the sun stays up until 10pm so believe me when I say you have plenty of time to explore the city! After dropping my bags and making the most of the champagne that welcomed me, I began exploring Dublin on foot. This city is fun, vibrant and can be quite crowded in summer but the crowd just adds to the liveliness. The closest attraction to The Merrion is St Stephen’s Green, which you can reach on foot in about 5 minutes. After wandering through what could be named Dublin’s Central Park, make your way to nearby Grafton Street for a lively shopping experience. Temple Bar is Dublin’s famous bar, pub and nightlife area. The area is fun to explore during the daytime, too (especially if you’re not one for partying into the wee hours of the morning!) After a full two weeks exploring Ireland my stay at The Merrion was a welcomed retreat. The staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming and make the stay feel more like coming home. I can highly recommend the ESPA spa inside the hotel if you’re looking to unwind. After being on the road for a few weeks, it was a welcomed escape. Room rates are approximately $500 per room, per night. You can save money by booking online via this link: Book your Stay at The Merrion."
116,"There is no bad time of year to visit Europe and as surprising as it may sound, winter is one of my favourite times of year to visit. Despite the cold and often sub-zero temperatures, Europe becomes a fairytale over the colder months as the Christmas Markets kick into gear and the magic of Christmas takes over. If you find yourself in Europe this winter, be sure not to miss these choices for the best Christmas Markets in Europe!  Dates: 17th November 2018 – 26 December 2018 Vienna is a city so beautiful it can often seem near impossible not to pinch yourself to make sure you’re not caught in a dream. The city is packed with beautiful boutiques selling all the Christmas decorations you didn’t know you needed, but no more so does the Christmas spirit come to life than at the annual Vienna Christmas Market. The location is idyllic to say the least as the Christmas spirit takes over the Belvedere Palace (yup, you’ll be celebrating Christmas right outside a palace – so European!) Dates: 22 November 2018 – 6th January 2019 Nearby to Vienna and just a short train ride away is one of the most beautiful small cities you’ll find across Europe: Salzburg. This city was made famous as the primary filming location for the Sound of Music, however we’d argue it is even more magical in real life.  This is also one of the longest running Christmas markets that carries over in to early January, so a great choice if you’re looking to add a couple of nights elsewhere in Austria.  Dates: 23 November 2018 – 30 December 2018 Over in the Alsace region on the border to Germany, the French town of Colmar is easily one of the most beautiful (if not the most) towns in the entire country. Colmar has a small but charming Christmas Market and the town itself is as pretty as a postcard. Dates: 23 November 2018 – 30 December 2018 Right by the Strasbourg Cathedral you will find one of my favourite (small but impossibly charming) Christmas Markets with thanks to its location on the border of France and Germany, bringing both the character and charm of traditional German Christmas Markets together with French luxury pastries.  Dates: 26 November 2018 – 31 December 2018 When I was living in Berlin some years ago this was my favourite Christmas market to visit (and so I did, quite a few times too many!) The smell of warm spiced nuts and glühwein was just impossible not to return at least twice weekly! This is also a great market to visit if you’re looking for handmade trinkets, especially wooden characters and intricately designed decorations for the tree. Dates: November 30 – December 23 Commonly regarded as Germany’s most famous Christmas market and certainly the largest, the first time I visited Nuremberg Christmas market was overwhelming to say the least! These markets take over much of the centre of town and warrant at least two days to see and experience all they have to offer. If you’re looking for somewhere to stay for a few days to take in the Christmas spirit, Nuremberg is the perfect choice as it has become quite a mecca for that Christmas spirit! Dates: End of November through the beginning of January If there’s just one event for Christmas in London, it is Hyde Park’s annual Winter Wonderland. The event is sprawling and enough fun for a two-day visit, so be sure to allow a couple of nights to wander around the market stalls and sip on mulled wine. Visit the website"
117,"Montenegro is a country I have been dying to visit. The lush green mountain ranges, the beautiful beaches in the south and the warm hospitality have always drawn me in. But for one reason or another, it took me a lot longer than expected to finally travel to Montenegro. If you are also considering this Balkan country, I’ve got the 10 best places in Montenegro listed to help you plan your stay! This year I was invited to speak at a conference for entrepreneurs and my mind was made up. I would stay three days for the conference and spend a further two weeks exploring Montenegro. My visit was in late May/early June and the weather was unseasonably unfavourable – rain and lots of it! However the few days of sunshine I did enjoy I was able to discover most of the Southern coast and some of Northern Montenegro toward the end of my trip. These are the places in Montenegro you must visit! Perast is a small fishing village that has quickly become a hot spot for foreign investors and visitors looking to venture beyond over-populated Kotor (more on that later). Be sure to take a short boat ride from the town toward the two man made islands that have made Perast famous; Our Lady of the Rocks and St. George. Located in a bay below the Lovćen mountains lies Kotor, the crowning jewel in Montenegrin tourism as it has quickly become a must visit destination following an influx of cruise ships that dock here over the summer months. The trick to visiting Kotor is to stay in the town itself, take regular day trips, and enjoy the town in peace and quiet once the cruise ships have departed for the day and the city streets are quiet and inviting. Be sure to hike the Kotor Fortress Trail for epic views over the city, a free alternative to the heavily populated Castle of San Giovanni trail that will also set you back eight euros (you can still visit the castle for free, just take the turn off on the Kotor Fortress Trail). Lovćen is a mountain in the southwest of Montenegro and offers incredible views over the mountain ranges below, often covered by a stream of low lying clouds making this destination even more ethereal. The price to enter is €2 for the national park and €5 to the mausoleum, where you can enjoy panoramic views from this man made stone lookout point. Heading North in Montenegro may seem like a mission, but it is one that will pay in dividends when you arrive to the epic scenery inside Durmitor National Park. This is one of Montenegro’s most celebrated regions to explore and great for long day hikes or multi-day treks throughout the summer or watch as the park becomes a major ski resort from December through March. This small islet off the southwest coast of Montenegro is home to the uber luxe Aman Sveti Stevan property but unless you have a spare €900 I would suggest appreciating the islet from afar as it is the perfect photo opportunity. Not too far from the capital of Montenegro you will soon run into Skadar Lake, the largest lake in southern Europe which also crosses the border to Albania. The lake is a popular choice in the summer for kayaking and other summer water sports. This forest national park in the north of Montenegro is home many epic lakes, mountains and even a ski resort in the colder months. There are four national parks in the country and although this is the smallest, it is easily one of the most beautiful. Đurđevića Tara Bridge is easily one of the most photographed locations in Montenegro, located in the north in Durmitor National Park. The bridge is a concrete arch bridge over the Tara River and is idyllically located between the villages of Budečevica and Trešnjica. Although not the most popular for bay towns in southwest Montenegro, Herceg Novi is still worth a visit, especially as it is less populated by floods of tourists. Herceg Novi sits at the opening of the Bay of Kotor and at the foot of Mount Orjen. Although it is close to the coast of Perast and can be visited at the same time, the small man-made island known as Our Lady of the Rocks deserves its own mention for being one of the most photogenic locations in the entire country. If you have more time be sure to consider these destinations in the Balkans to extend your trip. Crossing borders is easy and you can enjoy the difference in culture between Montenegro; neighbouring Bosnia & Herzegovina; Albania; Serbia and Croatia."
118,"Have you ever picked up a book and thought “I want their life”? Well, that is precisely what was forefront of my mind when I found myself skimming the shelves of a French Provincial homewares store in Tasmania, where I live, dreaming of a life in France. The book was The Cook’s Atelier, a collection of recipes and stories from a mother and daughter duo living out their dream life in France. Oftentimes I wonder about packing up my things and moving halfway across the world to a town in France. It would be somewhere in Provence, I imagine, a short bicycle ride into town from my stately chateau (renovated with love and patience). There are films to this effect. Under the Tuscan sun, for one. It might be set in the Tuscan countryside, but the idea is the same: pack your bags and restart your life in Europe. Choose simple countryside living instead of complicated city life. A Good Year is another escapist’s dream if you’re looking for a film set in France. But then there are real world people living out their real world dreams, having moved to France to live out their days. Enter Marjorie and Kendall, a mother daughter duo who hail from Arizona, who are doing just that. After discovering their story, I reached out to Marjorie and Kendall to find out just what life is like owning a successful cooking school in France. The mother-daughter duo was prompt to respond, and to my delight, were already familiar with World of Wanderlust. “Your story is the epitome of what World of Wanderlust readers want to read and one day aspire to,” I wrote. And so began this interview across oceans and time zones, to discover exactly what life would be like to pack up your bags and move to France. Q: Let’s start with a brief introduction for readers not yet familiar with The Cook’s Atelier. Who is behind the cooking school-turned-brand, how did it come to be, and how long have you been in operation?   We founded The Cook’s Atelier in 2008. The concept for The Cook’s Atelier was envisioned many years before we actually moved to France.  We are originally from Arizona and have always been a close mother/daughter team.   I raised Kendall as a single mother and our origins are pretty humble.  We’ve always found it important to dream big and to think outside the box.  I pursued my passion for cooking, working my way up the ladder at various restaurants and ultimately opened my own when Kendall was young.  When Kendall left for college, it became clear that her passion was France.  After having spent a significant amount of time studying in France during her college years, she began studying viticulture in Burgundy.  I knew that ultimately that was where she belonged.  After many brainstorming sessions and countless glasses of wine, we decided to permanently uproot from our origins and took a leap of faith to create a new life in France.  We decided to combine our passions for food and wine to create The Cook’s Atelier.  We started with no formal business plan, just a strong gut instinct to create a place that we would love and hoped others would too.  Q: Congratulations on the success of The Cook’s Atelier! As always, an overnight success takes a lot of time, triumphs and tribulations. What were some of the roadblocks or challenges in creating a cooking school in France? We are very proud of what we have created with The Cook’s Atelier and are honestly sometimes surprised of how much momentum it has created on its own over the years.  For us, we don’t feel that it was an overnight success.  We started off very small, with the main focus being able to support ourselves and stay in France.  The majority of our guests have always found us by word of mouth and our business has grown organically.  Being entrepreneurs, we are always trying to improve and are constantly striving to make the experience for our guests even more unique and memorable. Regarding roadblocks and challenges, there have been many.  From securing paperwork to move here and be able to stay indefinitely, to navigating the tons and tons of French red tape in setting up a business as foreigners in France, it has all certainly kept us on our toes but we wouldn’t change a thing.  It has just been part of the journey. Q: I read in your book there was a previous (smaller) location of The Cook’s Atelier. How did you know it was time to expand to a bigger space? For the first five years, we started off in a tiny two-bedroom flat in the center of Beaune where we did cooking classes.  The original kitchen was the size of a closet so we took one of the bedrooms and turned it into a makeshift kitchen filled with many vintage treasures that we had found from brocantes, an old baker’s table for prep, and open shelves lined with some of our favorite cookbooks.  (The second bedroom was mine!).  At the time, Kendall was working with Kermit Lynch and helping me on the weekends with the classes. The place was sweet and very charming but we soon realized that it was not possible to continue to grow in that little flat.  Around this time, Kendall had met her future French husband, Laurent.  He was very helpful and always supportive during the early years of The Cook’s Atelier and when the time came to change the location, we decided to expand our concept and jumped feet first in creating our small family business.  Kendall quit her job at Kermit Lynch and Laurent joined the team.  Looking back on those first few years, The Cook’s Atelier was a very much a little micro business and although our concept has since expanded, the heart and soul of The Cook’s Atelier remains the same and that little apartment still holds a very special place in our hearts.  We were fortunate enough to be able to keep it and it is now our pied-à-terre where guest can stay when they join us for one of our culinary programs. Q: Are there any big hopes for the future of The Cook’s Atelier, or are you happy to keep operating within all of the success you have created? We are very thankful that we have been able to really intertwine the idea of work and family to create this beautiful place that we can share with others from around the world.  Since the very beginning, we have only had 10 guests at a time and our main concept has been to bring people from around the world together to cook and gather around our table for a convivial experience.  Whether it is a day or a week with us, we strive to make each experience one-of-a-kind and uniquely memorable for our guests.  We are very protective of holding on tight to that magic.  We have no plans to get bigger, just better and better at what we do.  We’d love to do another book and explore the possibility of doing a film series. Q: Your online cooking store is a great way to have a little piece of France at home. Are your customers mostly from France or abroad? Our online shop actually started for two reasons. 1)  Guests would always ask us where they could source our French cookware, cook’s tools or our vintage pieces that we used during the cooking classes. AND  2)  Over the years, we have become so obsessed with finding unique French items for our kitchen and our homes that we developed quite the collection.  As we quickly ran out of closet space, we determined it was time to make them available for others to enjoy in their own homes.  Our online shop is international and we get orders from all over the world. Q: What do you think is the American (and indeed many other countries) obsession with France and all things French? What do the French just do better? For us, we feel the draw to France is the way they approach life.  They have a better work/life balance and have this uncanny ability to really live fully in the moment.  They are very protective of their boundaries and allow themselves to really slow down.  As Americans, after all of these years, we are still working on it. Q: What is it you love the most about French cuisine? What we love most about French cuisine is the accessibility of quality ingredients.  It can be something as simple and humble as the perfect egg, or chickens raised with care.  There is still a link to where your food comes from here in France.  There are artisans who produce the food we cook; the cheesemaker, the winemaker and the gardener.  French cuisine doesn’t always have to be fancy or elaborate.  It’s about quality ingredients that are well-sourced. Q: What is it you love most about living in France? (I’m sure you could write a book just on this!) As Americans living in France, what we love most is the quality of life that is ever-present.  It is the rhythm of the day-to-day.  The opportunity to strive to always be in the present moment and to thoroughly embrace and enjoy the things that matter most. Q: Who are your inspirations in the kitchen? For us, we are old school.  Of course we love Julia but we are also inspired by M.F.K. Fisher, Elizabeth David, and Madeleine Kamman. Q: Do you have any favourite books about life in France and living in France?  We love ‘My Life in France’ by Julia Child as well as ‘Provence, 1970’ by Luke Barr. Q: If not Beaune, where else is most appealing to you to live in France? Beaune is difficult to top as it is neither too big nor too small and we are surrounded by some of the most beautiful vineyards in the world.  Q: Sweet or Savoury? Savoury. Q: Paris or Beaune? Beaune. Q: City or countryside? Countryside Q: Wine or cheese? Both.  You can never have cheese without wine. Q: Italian method macarons or French method macarons? French, of course. Q: Provence or Burgundy? Burgundy, but we love Provence and visit often. Q: Coffee or tea? Tea in the morning, but a hand pulled Italian espresso from our shop downstairs in the afternoon.  Q: Books or blogs? Books! Visit The Cook’s Atelier for more."
119,"Ahhh, Annecy. Where to begin? The cutest town in France (in my view) has much more to offer than an idyllic location, cute French patisseries and a gorgeous lake with the Alps as a backdrop. And yet of course, all of these things are what makes Annecy quite so appealing! I first saw this town on Pinterest and immediately decided I needed to visit (seriously, this town is so cute!) But upon our visit I quickly came to learn that there is much more to Annecy than meets the eye. So, we’ve got a great guide to help you plan your visit to the cutest town in France.  Located in the North of the French Alps, Annecy is a medieval town with a 14th-century chateau, characterised by its winding canal network and location beside Lake Annecy. Put simply, this town is as pretty (if not prettier) than a postcard. The city is at its best in the Spring season as the colourful blooms all over town really bring Annecy to life. You can expect an abundance of flower boxes, blossoms, and plethora of greenery in the public parks.  Many visitors come to Annecy as a day trip from Geneva, so your first point of call is likely to be a food stop – and believe me do I have some great recommendations in store for you! We stumbled across this eatery around lunchtime and quickly noticed it was much busier than any other eatery we had passed on the canals, as well as noticing that most diners were speaking in French and thus concluding it must be a popular local choice. This gave us no better reason than to stop, wait in line, and land a table at what we were sure would be a great lunch spot. Right we were! I ordered the goat’s cheese salad (above) and my boyfriend ordered steak, chips and salad. Both dishes were huge, great value for money, and incredibly delicious! If you’re looking for a quick bite to eat and something a little more casual, you’ll find just that at L’Heure Tourne. The burgers are gourmet, the relish is unforgettably delicious, and the staff do their best to help you out in English or, in my case, Frenglish (somewhere in between). As usual, I couldn’t finish a single meal in Annecy without a sweet treat afterwards (would you expect any less of me by now!?) We asked around with the locals in small boutiques where we could find the best gelato in town and the vote was unanimous: Le Palais Des Glaces. Believe me when I say it did not disappoint! The snickers was my favourite flavour. Annecy is one of those places you go to do very little and wind up doing a lot, as everything just occurs so naturally and with ease. Drop by the Lake (Lac Annecy) to rent a paddleboat and you’ll find yourself passing the hours, soaking up the sunshine and taking in the tremendous views. Another great way to see the city is to hire a bike, ride around the lake, navigate your way through the cities’ outskirts, and take each hour as it comes. And of course you can make your way to Chateau d’Annecy (the castle on the hill) to explore the 14th-century chateau and enjoy great views over the city. Unfortunately, we didn’t stay longer than the day in Annecy (if we had have known how picturesque and delightful it was beforehand, we would have booked 2-3 nights here). Thus I cannot make accommodation recommendations based on my own experiences, though if TripAdvisor is anything to go by, the following suggestions rate highly: L’Imperial Palace, Hotel Novotel Annecy Centre, and Mercure Annecy Centre.  Annecy is a popular day trip from Geneva, Switzerland – located just a one-hour bus ride from the Swiss city. By plane, Geneva is the nearest international airport, though flights in to Geneva are typically expensive so you may wish to fly in to Zürich and journey your way down through Geneva. Annecy also has direct trains from Paris & Lyon, making this a great city escape for a few days out of the big cities. "
120,"Distinguished by its canals and cobblestone streets, Bruges is living evidence that fairytales exist. Old world charm aplenty, there’s no question that this is the most beautiful town in Belgium. If you plan to make the trek to West Flanders, here’s everything you need to know to make the most of your time in Bruges in our travel guide to Bruges.  Chances are you will arrive in Bruges at the main train station, a short 10-minute stroll from the centre of town. Pre-load your google maps or follow the signs (and crowds) toward the centre of town. This city is best explored on foot or by bicycle, so getting lost is half of the fun. A city as picturesque as this, there really is no harm in going map-less and seeing where you wind up. If it helps, the Bellfry tower is a great point of reference to look up toward and find your way back to the centre of town. Bruges is one of the most visited cities in Belgium. The other most visited cities are Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent. However, if I dare say it, Bruges is the most memorable. If you don’t like crowds, opt for an Autumn or Winter visit. If you visit in summer then you can expect to experience some crowds in Bruges. Spring is another popular season however not as chaotic summer, plus you’ll have the added aesthetic of fresh blooms. There really is no bad time to visit Bruges, however, each season has its pros and cons. This is a debatable question that warrants a few different answers. You can easily see Bruges in one day. That is more than enough time to see all the highlights, enjoy Flanders culture and experience the city. If you prefer to travel at a slower pace, I would recommend two or three nights in Bruges. This is the kind of city you can really slow down time.  As a waterborne city, the canals of Bruges form a network linking the capital of West Flanders to the North Sea. The canals thus form a core of Bruges’ identity and as you wander around the winding waterways, you can’t miss the Groenerei (Green Canal), the most romantic snapshot of Bruges’ canals. The best photo opportunity is from Peerdebrug (The Horse Bridge) on Peerdenstraat. Bruges’ iconic Gothic square sits at the heart of the city and is a perfect example of quintessential Gothic architecture and Flanders culture + design. The Stadhuis (Town Hall) is a must see with its original 1376 design in tact. Take a tour inside to spot the original wooden ceiling on the first floor.  Also known as the Park of Love, this is no destination for the recently broken up with or solo traveller who would prefer not to be surrounded by a stream of couples wandering around the waterways. Should you not be one of the aforementioned, however, this is one of the most romantic locations in all of Bruges. As one of the most stunning postcard-worthy photo spots in all of Bruges, you cannot miss the opportunity to visit Rozenhoedkaai, particularly in the evening when the city lights up. This quaint and charming little square is filled with al fresco cafes and one of the most beautiful spots in town that is somehow not flooded with tourists. There are many bridges in Bruges but if we had to pick just one you cannot miss, Bonifacious would be it. The addition of the Church of Our Lady in the background makes this another quintessential photo opportunity not to be missed.   If you’re staying in town for a couple of days, prepared to be spoiled for choice! Despite the old world charm of Bruges, the restaurant and dining scene is years ahead of its’ time. Here are our top picks: This casual coffee shop will quickly become a pit stop on your adventures around town – particularly if you’re fond of homemade baked goods, soups and a cup of tea in the afternoon. Cordoeaniersstraat 4, Bruges 8000, Belgium If you’re looking for a mediterranean touch, then look no further than this Greek restaurant. It is one of the most popular spots in town but the meals are huge and the atmosphere hits the spot. Wollestraat 3, 8000 Brugge, Belgium This is our top pick for vegetarians and vegans as the options are plentiful, the food is incredible and full of unexpected flavour combinations. Goezeputstraat 6, 8000 Brugge, Belgium This small vegetarian restaurant is open for lunch only, but is a great budget-friendly option for soup and a main meal (the offering changes daily). Note: open only on weekdays, 12pm-2pm. Katelijnestraat 82, 8000 Brugge, Belgium One of the best options in town for vegetarians and vegans. De Plaats serve up really fresh, wholesome food and the service is very friendly, making it a great option for a casual lunch or dinner. Note: they close between the end of lunch service and beginning of dinner service, so be sure to check hours before disappointment! Wapenmakersstraat 5, 8000 Brugge, Belgium Dark and grungy bistro that might just become your favourite place in town. The food is hearty and they cater to dietary requirements, making it a great choice for a casual almost pub-style feed. Kuipersstraat 23, 8000 Brugge, Belgium  As the name suggests: the sweet spot in town! Since you can’t come to Belgium without trying at least one waffle, be sure to make a pit stop (and prepare to make it a regular one). Noordzandstraat 1, 8000 Brugge, Belgium A lovely little bakery/patisserie serving a range of baked goods, including macarons. Schaarstraat 2, 8000 Brugge, Belgium This bagel “salon” is the perfect light lunch spot. The decor is casual and they’ve got plenty of takeaway items if you’re planning a picnic in one of Bruges many public parks. Predikherenstraat 11, 8000 Brugge, Belgium For old school interior lovers, look no further than the classic bakery that has been around as long as the locals. This typical Flanders bakery is a great way to step back in time and there’s a huge selection of teas, should you fancy a cuppa. Wijngaardstraat 8, 8000 Brugge, Belgium   For a spectacular view over the city and a workout all-in-one, you can’t miss the opportunity to ascend the 366 steps to the top of the Belfry tower. Be sure to plan and book your tickets in advance or arrive early to do so – this is one of the most popular attractions in town. For a walk through Flemish and Belgian painting styles, look no further than the Groeninge Museum. If you were to pick just one museum to enter, this Fine Arts museum would be our top choice. This impressive church (interior pictured above) is another insight in to a time now passed, with its impressively well-kept 12th-15th century facade and interiors. Located on the outskirts of town, the windmills around Bruges are where you will capture a great image of the city from afar, particularly at sunset.   48 Hours in Ghent 48 Hours in Antwerp"
121,"Prague has always been one of my favourite cities I have visited across Europe. There’s so much I love about this city including the architecture, hearty Czech food and lovely locals. But it is the unique fairytale charm that keeps me coming back for more. And it is this ethereal appeal that attracts so many visitors to the city year after year. So, what do you need to know before you visit Prague? Let’s dive in!  The beauty of Prague is that it is compact, easy to walk around and most of the points of interest are within such a small vicinity that you can see all the major attractions within one-two days. Add that with one magical day to explore without intent on going anywhere in particular and you have the perfect combination of three days in Prague. Got more time? Lucky you! There is plenty to see and do in this city beyond the major attractions, so this is a classic case of the more the merrier (maybe a beer spa sounds like your thing?)  With such a rich history and nothing short of a tumultuous past, the architecture in Prague shows you firsthand just how much this city has changed over the centuries. Nowhere is modern world history more prevalent than in the Jewish Quarter and thus you cannot leave Prague without walking around the neighbourhood and if you’re into history, be sure to join a free walking tour for an introduction to the history of Prague. Fair warning: these tours can be incredibly hard to fathom, given the modern world history of Hitler’s occupation in the city.  The old town of Prague is a living history to be explored – incredible architecture, antique stores, cobblestone alleyways and so much charm you’ll struggle to capture the magic of Prague in words! The buzz of the city is enough reason to get out there and see the city above ground, though if you have a distance to walk between your accommodation and the Old Town, you can always use the metro to get from A to B (it is incredibly easy to use and cheap!)  Old Town Square The historic square of Prague is not only the prettiest part of town but also the best insight into the cities’ unique history. The Gothic Church of Our Lady before Týn sets the backdrop of the square which is one of my favourite places to people watch and pass a couple of hours wandering through the side streets and their merchants’ stores. Astronomical Clock Whilst in the Old Town Square be sure to visit and watch the astronomical clock as it comes to life on the hour. Charles Bridge Whilst construction started in 1357 it was not until the early 15th century that Charles Bridge was completed and became one of the top tourist attractions for the city of Prague. Be sure to wander across the bridge in the early hours of the morning or late hours of the evening without the crowds as it offers a completely different experience than the shoulder nudging on offer during the day! The Lennon Wall A tribute to Lennon and the many songs he penned with The Beatles, the Lennon Wall is one of the more heartwarming places to visit in the city (and especially nice to visit when you’re looking for a break from Prague’s harsh history!) Prague Castle Dating back to the 9th century, Prague Castle is a huge complex to explore and also hosts one of the best views across the city.  If you want to step back in time to the Czechoslovakia days then look no further than entering the time warp that is Cafe Savoy. This beautiful old cafe is one of the most photogenic spots in town but be prepared to wait – it is arguably the most popular cafe in the city! Although a little less popular, the decor and vibe on offer at Cafe Slavia is arguably just as special. I love sitting by the window and people watching as the hour passes by, before picking myself up to continue my explorations on foot! Visit Cafe Slavia Finally a third cafe to visit on your coffee-hopping tour of Prague is nearby Cafe Louvre; another of Prague’s most beautiful cafes. Visit Cafe Louvre  Although there is a great public transport system in Prague (especially handy if you’re on a budget), there’s always the option to Uber which is especially useful when you arrive at the airport late of an evening. Prague also has regular taxis but they are expensive and often the temptation seems a little too strong to scam tourists! Uber is a great alternative when you want to know the price before you commit – I used it the morning I was travelling to the train station very early when it was still dark and it was good to know I would arrive on time and for a fair price!  Chances are you’ve already heard this from friends or family who have visited Prague, but just as a reminder be sure to listen to the legends (and quite frankly horror stories!) and avoid exchanging money at the “no fee” money exchangers all over the city. While they may not charge a fee they are a huge scam and offer very dismal rates – thus ripping you off of precious spending money!"
122,"Heading further East in Europe always leads to a more spontaneous adventure. And that is certainly what I found when travelling onwards from Budapest to Brasov, a city in Romania. Whilst in Romania I had a week to explore the gorgeous towns and castles nearby, but soon discovered there is so much more to see and do in Romania than first meets the eye! If you find yourself in this gorgeous country with incredible landscapes and history, then here are the places you absolutely must visit in Romania! Let’s start with an old favourite of mine in the Carpathian Mountains: Peleș Castle. This is commonly referred to as the most beautiful castle in Europe and one look at this photograph is sure to show you why. The romantic castle was finished in the early 20th century and remains to be one of the top attractions in Romania (of which you can probably see why!) Surrounded by the Carpathian mountains, Brasov is a great place to base yourself when exploring the Transylvania region of Romania. This region is where you will find the legend of Dracula and many beautiful castles to explore, making it one of the best bases for exploring the whimsical landscapes nearby. Another picture-perfect city in Transylvania is Sibiu, located on the Cibin River. This city is as pretty as a postcard and is another great choice for a base to explore the region. Don’t miss the views from the clocktower! When you are visiting cities and towns as beautiful as this, you might consider a photo tour with a local provider. Romania photo tours offer guided tours around the country and in popular cities for photography enthusiasts. Whether you’re interested in cultural-theme photo tours, wildlife or landscape tours, there is something for every interest. (Image via Horia Varlan / Flickr) Located in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, the Romanian Athenaeum is an impressive concert hall both inside and out. If you find yourself in Bucharest for a few days, consider coming to see a concert for the full experience. (image via wikicommons) This is perhaps the sole reason I came to Romania in the first place (okay, I won’t tell a lie, it is the reason I came!) The legend of Dracula centres around a 15th Century prince named Vlad Dracul III, who was known for impaling his enemies. The castle is now known as Bran Castle and owned privately, however you can visit the castle for a small charge. Well worth it! Another beautiful city of Romania in the North-western region is Cluj-Napoca, unofficially considered to be the capital of Transylvania. This city is much larger than the aforementioned cities in the region with a very happening social scene, so a great place to base yourself if you’re looking to get out and about with a more happening night life. (image via Dennis Jarvis / Flickr) If you happen to rent a car and drive around Romania, one of the most impressive roads to discover is Transfăgărășan, also known as Ceaușescu’s Folly. This section of road travels through the Carpathian mountains with dramatic scenery and an even more dramatic road route! If you find yourself in Iasi, be sure to check out the Palace of Culture – a landmark of the city and home to a variety of exhibitions year-round. (Image via Andrew Colin / Flickr)"
123,"Rome is a city like no other – brimming with ancient history, charismatic Romans, great local cuisine and of course, wine to match. For my third visit in the Italian capital I was determined to venture beyond the tourist sites and see more of Rome from a local’s perspective, so I enlisted my friend Simone from Access Italy to show me around the cities’ current hot spots, new openings, and the best-kept secrets in Rome.  The hottest table in town (if you can manage to get one) is currently to be found at Terraza Borromini, a large terrace overlooking the city with one of the best sunset views you’ll find in Rome. Via di Santa Maria dell’Anima, 30, 00186 Roma  Rome is a mecca for fashion designers and the fashionistas who adore them, so a visit to Fendi Casa should be high on your list if you’re up for an exclusive taste of the high life above the Fendi flagship. Largo Carlo Goldoni, 420, 00187 Roma RM, Italy  Little do most people know, there are a handful of ways to go “beyond the scenery” inside the Vatican, including private tours, visits to the mosaic studio, and the story goes that you can even land a visit with the Pope himself! Access Italy offers a range of exclusive tours in the Vatican and best of all… you can skip the lines! Vatican City  If you came to Rome for food and weren’t impressed, the only explanation is that you didn’t know where to go. Foodies rejoice: there’s a whole neighbourhood waiting to be explored and it goes by the name of Testaccio. For that classic homemade Italian booking, visit Agustarello and La Torricella. Both are informal and offer some of the most authentic home cooking in the city. If a pizza is more your style, head straight for the thin crust pizza at Da Remo. Take it from me, this is one of the best-kept secrets in Rome. Testaccio neighbourhood, Roma  When meandering the streets of Rome it can be easy to fall victim to crowds and the displeasures associated with them. However some of Rome’s most romantic side streets are often located adjacent to the busy pedestrian streets – such is the case for Via Margutta, one of the best kept secrets in Rome. Via Margutta, Roma  For a glimpse into Roman life and lifestyle, be sure to keep your eyes peeled for open doors and gates that show the inner courtyards of residences and the secrets held behind them. This is one of my favourite games to play when visiting European capitals like Paris and so worth while when you stumble upon a hidden gem like this one!  Rome is a perfect post card waiting to happen at almost every corner, but none more so than the river views and classic backdrop on offer from Ponte Umberto I. For the best photo from this vantage point, head down the stairs toward the river itself for a classic leafy framing with Rome in the background. Ponte Umberto I  One of Rome’s best views is to be had atop Pincian Hill, so if your sneakers allow for a little extra walking one day, be sure to venture up to the top! There are beautiful gardens nearby to enjoy and escape the hustle and bustle of the city down below. Viale Gabriele D’Annunzio, 00187 Roma  If sunset views and inventive cocktails are more your style, then look no further than the rooftop bar inside Hotel Eden for great food, cocktails, and some of the best sunset views in Rome. Il Giardino, Hotel Eden, Roma  Although this location is far from a secret, the secret to visit the Colosseum just before sunrise still seems to be pretty well kept! You’ll often find only one or two other photographers here at this time of day and can enjoy the monument almost all to yourself. Be sure to arrive just before sunrise for the magical yellow lights as they click off as the sun begins to rise.  One of the main questions on my mind for Rome was simple: where to find the best gelato? After tasting almost all the gelato on offer in Rome, I can say with certainty that the best gelato in Rome is to be found at Giolitti in the centre of town – a short stroll from the Pantheon. My favourite flavour combo was dark chocolate and raspberry…… drool! Via degli Uffici del Vicario, 40, 00186 Roma  Another monument that is entirely different when visited at sunrise is the recently renovated Spanish Steps. Nowhere else in Rome seems as vibrant and uplifting, especially without the crowds to enjoy it all to yourself!  Perhaps our favourite of all is what we’d like to call the most underrated view in all of Rome, looking through the Aventine Keyhole. This secret view of St. Peter’s dome peers through the gardens of the Villa del Priorato di Malta.  To uncover these hidden secrets of Rome I joined Access Italy for a private tour of the Italian capital. All opinions and photos are my own!"
124,"So I’m doing it: I’m naming my favourite European cities (of. all. time.)!! Whilst planning an upcoming Spring visit to Europe with my other half, I got to thinking about my favourites cities I had visited thus far. Our upcoming trip in April will be anything from familiar, visiting the Italian coastline, small French towns and various parts of Switzerland, but it was fun to look back through the lens of retrospect nonetheless, to consider where has been my favourite thus far. For those of you new to my blog, I have visited Europe countless times over the course of the past 7 years, visiting Western, Eastern, Southern, Northern Europe… and everywhere in between. There are a few countries I am saving (could a honeymoon location ever beat Greece – one day hopefully!) and a few hidden gems I am eagerly wishing to uncover in the cooler months either late this year or next (think Belarus; more of Russia beyond Moscow & St Petersburg; Montenegro and especially Norway). But with the next adventure looming, I’ve picked my favourite cities all over Europe of all time – I would love to read about yours in the comments below!  If you haven’t read about how much I loved Warsaw on my blog, then you’re missing out. Not to worry – you can read about Warsaw here. Having visited Poland for the first time at 17 years of age with the intention to see Krakow and Krakow alone, I can honestly say that I made a huge mistake by not exploring more of Poland back then. Warsaw is an incredible city with a turbulent past but optimistic outlook, with a stunning old town that one could wander for days on end.  Although I’m trying not to retrace my steps and go anywhere I have been before on this upcoming trip to Europe in Spring, I have made an exception here and there for cities that I loved at first glance, but never gave myself enough time to explore at first instance, thus warranting a return. Zurich is one of those cities. I first visited Zurich a couple of years ago for just one day and to be honest, you can totally see and enjoy the city in just one day – but I left feeling like I still wanted more. I wanted to visit more bakeries, eat more chocolate, and return when I had found romance to stroll along the river and see the city in a different light. And now that time has finally come! I’m beyond excited to re-explore Zurich this year and share these adventures with you.  I can’t believe I’m admitting this right now – but the above photo is the only proof I have that I once visited Munich, a city so pretty I barely stopped for a second to take a photo (no, it wasn’t the beer goggles I swear – I’m not a big drinker at all). Of course this city is renowned for Oktoberfest, a beer festival especially popular with the international travellers, but after visiting in August I can honestly say the city is just as pretty and enjoyable any time of year! It was also a great base from which to explore nearby Neuschwanstein Castle – a must do!  I’ll be bold here and admit that when I first arrived in Copenhagen in the dead centre of winter (January/February), I truly didn’t know if I would enjoy my time here. Not only was it cold (the kind of cold where if a limb doesn’t fall off soon, you’re in so much pain you’ll chop it off yourself), but it was also quite grey and impossibly expensive. Because I was there already, fancy hostel room paid for in advance, I stuck it out and sure enough, I absolutely adored Copenhagen. Not just the architecture (Nyhaven is a delight to the eye) but also the food and my lovely local guide (and long term friend), Jasmina, who years later invited me to her wedding (!!) Rendering her one of the closest friends I have ever made travelling and cementing my amazing time in the Danish capital.  I have only ever written one blog post on World of Wanderlust about Latvia, that being on the charming and impossible cute capital; Riga. From my experience here (the friendly locals, intriguing cuisine and endearing way of life) I would love to explore more of Latvia, however only stopped over for one night on a flight from Russia to Turkey with a budget airline who so kindly allowed for an 18 hour stopover, leaving just enough time to grab a night of rest and a few hours exploring. I would totally recommend this city based on this experience alone!  There is quite possibly no other city in the world that I want to return to as much as Moscow, Russia. I first visited Moscow a few years ago at the start of my East > West European adventure, beginning in Moscow and ending in Paris. Unfortunately due to a flight delay, lost luggage and length stay in Abu Dhabi to retrieve said luggage, I arrived in Moscow days later with just one night/one full day to experience the city before catching the train to St Petersburg (which I would highly advise booking in advance unless you want to spend 10 hours on a slow train when the favourable option is the high speed Sapsan!) Thus I had next to no time at all to enjoy the Russian capital and – can you believe it – did not even get the chance to walk through the Kremlin. Again, there is no city I want to return to more than here – fingers crossed for this year or next!  I really don’t see how it could remotely possible to visit the musical town of Salzburg in Austria and not have a smashing time doing it. This city is so pretty… the kind of pretty that inspires novels, artwork… The Sound of Music!?!?! I really cannot speak a bad word about the city of Salzburg and loved it so much that I have since ventured back a second time to explore some more. I would absolutely recommend the Sound of Music tour; Mirabellgardens; Salzburg Dom; Christkindlemarkts in December and an apple spritzer to finish off any meal!  I had absolutely no idea what to expect when arriving by ferry to Tallinn for the day, on a day trip from nearby Helsinki (Finland). I certainly didn’t expect to see small town charm in a capital city like this and I’ve gotta say – the whole day was a pleasant surprise. Like Latvia, I feel as if I’ve only just scratched the surface in Estonia and would love to explore the country more – perhaps prompting a trip to the Baltics in the future!? I’m sure it comes as no surprise to long time readers of my blog that I love, love, love Berlin. I loved Berlin so much so, that I moved here for a couple of months to try it out as a city to base myself in in Europe for the following year. As fate would have it I met my now partner back in Australia just a month later when attending a wedding at home, so have since moved back to Australia as my “base” (though really, everywhere is home!). My time in Berlin was short and sweet, but I truly love this city in a can’t-quite-put-my-finger-on-it kinda way. There are many ups and downs to living as an expat in Germany (the government system is notoriously hard to navigate – though I’m sure France has one up on them in that department), but I really do look back fondly on my time in Berlin. And oh, what I would give for another lunch at Daluma!  With the famous coffee culture and incredible arts scene, there really isn’t much not to love about Vienna! I would strongly recommend seeing an opera or ballet (even if you just pay a few euros for a standing ticket on the night); walking or tramming out of your way to see Hundertwasserhaus; seeing “The Kiss” in the Belvedere (especially for art lovers); kaffeehaus hopping around the city and oodles more in the Vienna guide (be sure to spend at least 4 days here, it is such a beautiful city to enjoy!)  I am yet to meet a person who does not like Amsterdam enough to rave about it and proceed to recommend it to me, even when they know I’ve been before (ha)! i loved my time in Amsterdam as much as the next person, though I would strongly recommend getting away from the sights (though do not miss the Anne Frank Museum) and just wandering the endless canals, alleys and streets like a local. Better yet – hire a bike!  I really struggled when choosing just one Italian city for the list but in fear of listing them all if I moved beyond one, I decided to narrow it down to Florence, the capital of Tuscany (though if I had more list space, I would definitely include Rome, Verona and Venice). Florence is beautiful beyond words. The radiating shades of terracotta underneath the Tuscan sun are just the beginning and I promise you that once you scratch the surface, you too will fall in love with this city (and its many gelaterias!)  Edinburgh is one of Europe’s most ethereal capital cities that will leave you feeling as if you have stepped into a time warp. This city is so high on my list for the love of Harry Potter, the beautiful architecture and just the overall feel that left me feeling endlessly inspired (no wonder J.K. Rowling wrote HP here!) I would also highly recommend venturing beyond Edinburgh for a larger trip in Scotland to nearby Glasgow (a really fun, young city with carefree locals) and the Scottish Isles (Isle of Skye is particularly hard to ever forget!) Oh! And for my fellow Harry Potter lovers, you absolutely must ride the (real) Hogwarts Express!  Stockholm to me, will forever be the Swedish capital that stole my heart. I visited Stockholm at the end of Autumn with my mother, who had flown over from Australia to visit me whilst I was living in Berlin (though I’m fairly certain she just took this as an excuse for a free holiday – lucky I love her)!!! We had an absolute ball in this city – visiting the ABBA museum (her preference), eating at incredible gastronomic restaurants (my preference) and going out of the way to visit the highly talked about Fotografskia museum which both of us enjoyed! Stockholm is expensive, yes. But its an investment worth while if you ask me!  I stumbled upon Ljubljana by complete accident a couple years ago when catching a connecting train en route to Lake Bled (one of the most romantic places EVER!) and couldn’t believe my luck. As it turns out this is for sure one of the prettiest capital cities in Europe, if not the most charming. Just a day here was enough to wander around, eat an al fresco lunch and grab some ice cream to accompany me along the river… but I would totally come back for a few more days in the future as it is impossibly romantic, colourful, charming, and just really, really, really picturesque. All of the words.  The colours, sites, smells and sounds of Lisbon are just a few key reasons you will fall absolutely head over heels in love with this crazy, fun, vibrant and loving city. I’ve visited Lisbon a couple of times – once on my own and once with a group of friends – both times were incredibly enjoyable. In fact, I’d say Lisbon is one of my all time favourite cities as a solo traveller as I felt so welcomed, happily greeted by locals in the street and just the vibe of the place was really enjoyable (it is literally a rainbow city, by the way!)  There’s something so magical about the point in which the East meets the West (quite literally), and it comes in the form of Istanbul, the capital city of Turkey. With just a few days in Istanbul a couple of years ago, Istanbul is another city I’m itching to get back to to re-explore any chance I get. The highlights (The Blue Mosque; Hagia Sofia; Basilica Cistern) are all worth while, even when enduring the long lines. But the best part of Istanbul for me was just wandering the streets, eating local street food, and finding hidden gems every little corner and nook you turned in to.  A little while ago I wrote about Budapest as one of Europe’s most underrated cities and while I still stand by that, I am glad to say that over the past few years it has really taken off in terms of tourism! Budapest is one of my all time favourite cities for too many reasons to list in full, but for the sake of a good article I will give it my best! If you’re into bathing rituals then look no further than Budapest – a city that is renowned for its public (and some private) bathing houses with thermal remedies. Then there’s the incredible blends of architecture that, once you take the chance to look up, make you realise this city is just as glorious and intriguing as Paris… though a little on the greyer side. The food is amazing (everywhere, I couldn’t give a bad recommendation if I tried) and the local currency allows for a cheaper stay as Hungary is yet to be on the Euro (lets hope it stays that way!)  I absolutely adore Paris and love it so much so, that I employed the help of my dear friend (and avid Paris lover) Faye Bullock to write about Paris here on the blog with a full section of dedicated articles on Paris. Because I just can’t help myself, my partner and I will return to Paris this year as I will quite literally take any excuse to return to the city of love and light. I have been approximately 7 or 8 times before (I’ve lost count), but it never ceases to amaze me how you can discover so many new things on each visit.  And to save the best for last – my all time favourite city in Europe is (perhaps a surprise to some of you who have not yet been to see and experience the magic) St Petersburg, Russia! I don’t even know where to begin when describing my love for this city. St Petersburg is a large city with equally large canals running throughout (think Venice but wider… much wider). The architecture is phenomenal as this was once the capital city of Russia (during Peter the Great’s reign most memorably) and thus a display of Russian wealth and opulence… if even only for the aristocracy at the expense of the peasants. The Hermitage, once used as the Winter Palace for Russian royalty, now houses one of the most impressive art collections in the whole world (if you ask me, THE most impressive) and the nearby summer palace (Peterhof) is another must see. Beyond that, explore!   Over to you – where are your favourite cities in Europe!? Can you narrow it down to three?"
125,"So, you’re looking for a complete guide to Slovenia? Look no further! I first visited Slovenia five years ago on a whirlwind journey through Europe. After travelling East, I was en route to Venice from Zagreb and made the choice to stay a couple of nights in Slovenia. I knew nothing about the country other than seeing a photo of Lake Bled some years prior. And just like that my obsession with Slovenia began! I’m quite fond of finding emerging destinations before they’re dubbed cool. There’s something about the chase of finding out about a place before anyone else and enjoying it sans crowds. After that trip, I promised myself to return to the country and see all it has to offer. Finally, it happened! Slovenia is a great choice for solo travellers because it is safe and affordable. There are also endless activities on offer to keep yourself busy. Winter has become increasingly popular as a more affordable alternative to neighbouring countries’ ski resorts. However, this trip took place in the warmer months by way of a road trip across the country. Summer is busy season in Slovenia and the best time of year to experience the country. Because the country is 80% covered by the Carpathian mountains, the seasons in Slovenia are very distinct. In July you can expect half the month to be raining, either all day or intermittently. The weather is hot and humid, but each time it rains the temperature cools off. June and August are the most popular months as they are similarly warm nut dryer. The average temperature is around 21-26 degrees celsius. Summer activities are mostly centred around the lakes. Lake Bled is Slovenia’s crowning jewel of tourism, though nearby Lake Bohinj is a great option if you’re looking to escape the crowds. Elsewhere in Slovenia Piran is the most popular seaside town, located on Slovenia’s small portion of the Adriatic coast. Visiting Slovenia in winter means less crowds and a completely different experience. As someone who loves the ski season, I planned to visit Slovenia in January this year but because of other commitments, ended up visiting in summer (of which I have no regrets!) Winter in Slovenia is characterised by skiing, snow activities and an average temperate of 3 degrees celsius. One of the biggest draw-cards for travellers to Slovenia in winter is the affordability of ski resorts in Slovenia. Slovenia’s Kranjska Gora lists #2 in the most affordable ski destinations in Europe after Bansko in Bulgaria. My first visit to Slovenia was short and sweet so I was determined to make this trip more comprehensive. I wanted to see all the highlights of Slovenia without spending too little time in each destination and after my trip I would recommend 10 days as the perfect amount of time to visit the country. Ljubljana is Slovenia’s capital city and will be your point of arrival if you are flying in to Slovenia. The city is comparably small in size to other European capitals, though if you’re not too short on time I would recommend spending two days and two nights here to really see all the city has to offer. With two days in Ljubljana you can really take in the atmosphere of the city. Ljubljana is without a doubt one of the prettiest capitals in Europe and has a great vibe in the summer months. Be sure to visit the Ljubljana Castle, dine al fresco along the river, wander the city streets without a destination and eventually make your way to Tivoli Gardens. There is a small cafe on the terrace that is beautiful to sit and let the afternoon pass you by with a book and coffee. If hiking in the mountains is your idea of a getaway then look no further than the peace and serenity of Jezersko. This mountainous region is best for day hikes and switching off by tuning in to nature. Situated just below the border to Austria, Jezersko is still one of the hidden gems in Slovenia that is not frequented by travellers (yet!) You can’t come to Slovenia without visiting the beautiful Lake Bled. Yes, it is crowded in summer. Yes, you will have to share the serenity but yes, Lake Bled is the most beautiful location in Slovenia and worthy of the hype. From here you can take a day trip to Triglav National Park for some epic day hikes. There isn’t a great deal to see and do in Celje but I chose to stop here on my way to the southeast part of the country for one night. You could certainly skip this stop and travel straight through to a smaller town or village, though I did enjoy stopping to meet my friend Tilin and see his city. On this day I also drove to Predjama to see the famous castle built in to the cliffside and go on an underground adventure into to Postojna caves. For my last couple of days in Slovenia I travelled south to the lesser visited areas of Slovenia to enjoy a little peace and quiet at Otočec Castle. The castle has been a hotel for around a decade and offers a great setting to enjoy the Slovenian countryside, while only being an hour drive away from Ljubljana. Alternatively: you might wish to visit the coast instead by driving to Piran. This is probably what I would have done if I had my time again! Return to Ljubljana for your flight home or to your next destination. You can also catch the train from Ljubljana to Venice as I did five years ago!"
126,"A walk through the Louvre, an elevator up the Eiffel Tower and a gruelling climb up the stairs to the Arc De Triomphe. Is this the Paris you have planned to visit? If so, you might be considering the Paris pass. And if you’re not sure yet whether it is worth the money, here is my complete Paris pass review. For my umpteenth visit to Paris I decided it was time to check off all the “hot spots” I was yet to visit and finally be able to say I had seen the Mona Lisa up close and to walk the hallowed halls of the world’s most renowned museum. Years ago I was standing in a 2-hour line to climb the Notre Dame Cathedral when I noticed a family of four gain immediate, complimentary access. Magic! I have since researched the Paris Pass and decided it was my golden ticket to fast track my way about town, finally ticking off all the attractions I was yet to visit. So, what’s the verdict? Is the Paris Pass worth the money?  Lets talk money matters first, because what’s the point in buying a Paris Pass if you’re not going to make use of it? The cost of the Paris Pass is: 2 Days: €110
3 Days: €169.00
4 Days: €199.00
6 Days: €239 I chose the four days and pushed myself to see as much as I could each day, without robbing myself of enough time at each attraction and with plenty of pit stops (for macarons, mostly). Access to Paris’ top museums and monuments. Metro + Bus travel for the duration of your pass. 1 Day Hop-On-Hop-Off Bus Tour. Seine River Cruise. Entry to a few other sights like the Palais Garnier & Versailles. It is important to note that neither the Eiffel Tower nor the Catacombs are included in the PP.  For me, yes. Because time is money and I’d rather be eating in a cafe feeling oh-so-Frenchie than I would be spending hours in a line to enter the Louvre. BUT, it totally depends on you and your itinerary when in Paris. The best way to decide if it is worth your investment is to make a mock itinerary of all the museums +monuments + attractions you plan to visit. Crunch the numbers and then see if the value weighs up for you. My pass being €199 for four days worked out to be around €50 per day, which meant a lot of sight seeing and cruising on the metro, which I only do if I have a long way to travel for fear of missing the action above ground. Some of the major attractions you might be interested in visiting are: Arc de Triomphe — Adult: €12.00 Panthéon — Adult: €9.00 Notre Dame Cathedral Towers — Adult: €10.00 Sainte-Chapelle — Adult: €10.00 Palace of Versailles — Adult: €20.00 (half to full day trip out of Paris) Château de Fontainebleau — Adult: €11.00 (full day trip out of Paris) One-Day Hop-on Hop-off Bus Tour — €31.00 Paris Opera House (Palais Garnier Opéra) — Adult: 11.00 Montparnasse Tower — Adult: €15.00 Unlimited Metro for 5 days – Adult: €37.25  For me the pass was not worth it money-wise, but time-wise it was a lifesaver. But for those who have not seen Paris and wish to visit all the major attractions in one hit – read on! As this was my 10th (or 11th or 12th?) visit to Paris, I have already visited most of the major attractions. However I did enjoy cutting lines and skipping my way to the front with my magic card. If you plan to visit big ticket sights like Versailles, do the hop-on-hop-off tour and see the best view of Paris from the Montparnasse Tower ALL IN ONE DAY, then yes, this pass is totally worth it. The only hook is that you’ll need to wake early, hit the ground running, and make the most of the pass while you have it. Click here to buy the Paris Pass (if you wish). I hope you enjoyed this Paris pass review. Happy travels in the city of light!"
127,"I was just seventeen years old when I first stepped foot in Poland. I had never even been to Europe before this trip and it completely captured my heart. Since then I have visited countless cities and towns in Poland and am here to share with you my favourite places. One thing I will say is that Poland will surprise you. Give yourself enough time to experience more of Poland beyond one or two major cities. After all, the best kept secrets are the small towns! We will start with Kraków because that is exactly where I started my Polish travels more than a decade ago. This city is as pretty as the photos you’ve probably seen online. Believe me when I say it lives up to its expectations! To make the most of your time here, begin your adventure in Rynek Główny, the main square of the old town. You could spend at least a day here in the older part of town, meandering your way in and out of streets and alleyways. But of course, the main attraction for visitors to Kraków is the opportunity to visit and pay respects at Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps. Be sure to mentally prepare yourself, it is quite an impactful day. It was on my second visit to Poland when I discovered Warsaw. Anyone familiar with Poland will, of course, know Warsaw as the capital city, so it may surprise you that I missed visiting the first time. But I made up for the lost time when I visited Warsaw on my next trip. And I’m so glad I did! This capital city has so much to offer the history buffs among us. Poland as a country has been torn apart and pieced back together at so many points throughout history – and Warsaw is a reminding factor. The old town is beautiful but not original. Even that was reconstructed after its demise! I would also recommend going on a communist tour to get a better understanding of the turbulent history this country has endured. Wrocław is such a quaint and charming small city, just over the border from Germany or the Czech Republic. In fact, it takes just 4 hours by fast train from Berlin to Wrocław, making this a great next step in your journey. Located in western Poland, this hidden gem is often considered the most beautiful city in all of Poland. It is most known for its market square, with the colourful dainty shop fronts that bring this city to life. Gdańsk is located on the northern coastline of Poland. It has therefore long served a pivotal role in the history Poland as it has long served as the hub for the world’s amber trade. The colourful facades of houses and shop fronts in the centre of town are a huge drawcard for visitors. Be sure to look out for the Gdańsk clock tower and you will always know your way back to the city centre! Zakopane is Poland’s leading ski resort town. In winter it is not only popular among the locals, but also draws an international crowd from all over Europe. Skiing in Poland might not be what you first had in mind, but it is much more affordable to the likes of Switzerland of even Austria. This ski town is located in the south of Poland at the base of the Tatras Mountains. Very near to Zakopane you will find Chochołów, a small town very near to the border of Slovakia. It is a beautiful town to stop and visit on your way to Zakopane and is popular with tourists year-round. And that rounds out our top picks for the best cities and towns to visit in Poland!

128,"Mallorca, located off the east coast of Spain, is the largest of the Balearic Islands. It is an island of pebbled beaches, rugged coves and olive groves where sun-drenched days can be spent harvesting freshly fallen figs, picking plump lemons from trees and foraging almonds directly from the ground. It is also a place to do little other than swim in the turquoise sea and gorge on sizzling king prawns cooked in olive oil and garlic. So if you plan on visiting the stunning sunlit island, here is a quick guide to Mallorca featuring the island’s best beaches, what to eat, where to stay and what to do.  The best time to go to Mallorca is during the shoulder season in late spring (April-May) or autumn (September-October) as the temperatures are still warm but the beaches are much less crowded. Summer (July-August) gets very busy and very hot so expect large crowds and high temperatures.  Drink: Sangria is to Spaniards, what Pimms is to Brits. A fruity concoction of red wine, lemonade, freshly sliced oranges, lemons and fresh mint make this an ideal drink to cool down in the heat. Alternatively, wine produced on the island is an excellent choice as is a refreshing aperol spritz. Eat: Spanish cuisine is heavily inspired by the Mediterranean, favouring lashings of olive oil, vibrant vegetables and fresh fish. In Mallorca you’ll find Spanish cuisine abound with traditional dishes such as paella, meatballs and fish on most menus. Order a selection of tapas to share and choose among favourites such as spicy patatas bravas, king prawns in garlic and olive oil, hearty Spanish omelet and sizzling chorizo.  The capital, Palma, is located in the South West of Mallorca and therefore the surrounding area is the busiest and most well-connected bursting restaurants, bars and clubs. I wouldn’t recommend this part of the island if you’ve come for peace and quiet. The North and East coast of the island are less spoiled, the North being known for tranquility and natural beauty and the East being known for long sandy beaches.  The beaches in Mallorca aren’t always the easiest to reach and quite often require a rocky descent down a winding path, but what awaits is often a rugged cove of pebbled beaches and sapphire seas. Below are just a few of the beaches along the North which are worth visiting: Cala Boquer: is a beautiful secluded beach with crystal like waters and very few people in sight. However it isn’t easy to reach; it entails a long walk over part of the Serra de Tramuntana mountain range before you even get a glimpse of the sea but the beautiful beach which awaits is worth the rocky hike. Cala Figuera: is an idyllic cove where the turquoise waters lap against the pebbled shore. You’ll have to descend a steep, rocky path to reach it but the enticing sea below will keep you motivated on your descent. Set up base on one of the flatter rocks with breathtaking views overlooking the sea and the few boats which are anchored a little further out. Cala Sant Vicenç – Cala Cabro: This area of northern Mallorca is a haven for secluded coves. Each beach is only a couple of minutes from the next but my favourite among them is Cala Cabro which is the furthest one away. It’s the most tranquil and by far the prettiest with its clear blue waters which is probably why its the most popular spot for scuba divers and kayakers.  One of the most thrilling ways to explore the island is by moped. Even if you’ve never ridden a motorbike or moped before, you can hire a 125cc which goes fast enough to whizz around the island, stopping off at beaches along the way.  The lighthouse at the top of Cap de Formentor marks the most northerly point of Mallorca. It’s a pretty scary ride to get there with hairpin bends and terrifying cliff faces but the views which await at the top are worth every second of the adrenalin-inducing drive.  The crystal clear waters are begging to be uncovered below the surface. The secluded bays are teeming with brightly coloured fish and vegetation making them a great spot for snorkeling as well as swimming.  The Serra de Tramuntana is a mountain range running along the southwest to northeast coast of Mallorca. It’s an area of remote mountains and hill towns and is the picture of the real Mallorca in all its rugged glory. This part of the country has been declared a World Heritage Site due to its physical and cultural appearance. Photography & Words by Faye Bullock"
129,"For the past seven years, I have been traveling the world solo, and my favorite continent to explore solo is by far Europe. There are many reasons I love traveling solo in Europe, namely, how much each country differs to the next, the incredible food, history, architecture, and how many other solo female travelers I meet also traveling across Europe. So here we are, my top picks for the safest cities in Europe for solo female travelers! If you are new to solo travel and particularly as a female, it can be daunting knowing where to go first to ease into the experience and test the waters to make sure your first solo trip is a memorable one. These are the safest cities in Europe for solo female travelers and although there are many more to name, these are the cities I felt most safe in and would suggest to fellow solo female travelers who are trying to decide where to start the solo travel experience. Enjoy! It took me a few visits to Europe to visit Copenhagen as I had heard by all accounts that it was one of the most (if not the most) expensive cities in Europe. Indeed, my few days in the Danish capital were pricey to say the least, but it was one of my favourite European winter cities to explore and I had such a great time traveling solo in Copenhagen and made a lifelong friend here (Jasmina) who showed me around her city and welcomed me with open arms. I never expected to love Ljubljana as much as I did but once I was able to wrap my head around the pronunciation (Lah – yoob – li – ya – nah) I couldn’t stop singing its’ praise! The small and compact capital of Slovenia is one of the prettiest and indeed one of the most underrated cities in all of Europe. The small nature of the city makes it easy to get around and walking is your best option, with many great cafes and parks to enjoy in the summer time – great for solo travelers. I had visited France a handful of times before I ever made my way to Lyon, the gastronomic capital of France (which I incorrectly thought to be Paris for a good 25 years of my life). Lyon is a great city for solo female travelers because you can eat, drink, walk and bicycle your way around the city in a rotating motion so that you’re always enjoying the foodie scene but working off your calories and seeing the city at the same time. The city is huge but don’t let that overwhelm you – the best way to see it is over a few days and explore a neighbourhood at a time. The Amalfi Coast has become one of Italy’s most popular holiday spots in recent years and is now one of Europe’s most sought after destinations. For solo travelers heading this way I would highly recommend basing yourself in Sorrento, the perfect small city to explore the Amalfi Coast from that feels authentic and much safer than neighbouring Naples (which, as much as I loved my time there, is not the safest city for solo female travelers). Make sure you don’t miss Positano (pictured), arguably the most beautiful town on the Amalfi Coast and of course Ravello, the most underrated town in the Amalfi. Quintessentially cute, Bergen is located on the southwestern coast of Norway and is commonly regarded as the most photogenic city in the entire country. Bergen is incredibly safe for solo travelers and indeed Norway as a whole is a great choice for solo adventures. With a reputation for being one of the most expensive countries to visit in Europe, you may want to break up your time in the cities with some time outdoors hiking/camping or if you want to see the fjordlands at leisure, I can highly recommend boarding a cruise for a week to see the coastal towns and cities of Norways. Vienna is by far one of my favourites cities in all of Europe and for sure one of the safest capital cities to explore on your own. Last year I spent my first Christmas in Vienna and had a marvellous time hopping from one Christmas market to the next. The coffee scene is a great way to pass the time alone and I’m sure if I had it my way, I’d spend weeks on end passing from one coffee shop to the next. Another great capital city to explore especially for their flight connections (Finnair seem to be one of the more affordable and well-connected airlines) is Helsinki, the capital of Finland. Helsinki is so safe that a local once described to me of their weekend, “nothing exciting happened, this is Helsinki after all”. The vibe of the city is a little underwhelming in the colder months but with a little bit of enthusiasm you can really enjoy walking around this city and if you’re in need of a little more excitement, take a day ferry to Tallinn in Estonia. If you’re a Harry Potter fan like me, there really is no reason not to love Edinburgh. The city where J.K. Rowling herself wrote some of the series, Edinburgh is a mecca for HP fans and even if you’re not a fan of the books and subsequent films, you can appreciate why the author got so much of her inspiration from this city. Edinburgh feels as old as time itself – there’s so much history and culture to explore here and the locals are all too happy to share it. Edinburgh is also home to one of Europe’s prettiest castles with an enviable location that oversees the entire city. If you journey to London and are looking for more of a countryside escape or a day trip from London, Oxford is one of the most beautiful and safe cities to explore on your own. The city is brimming with students and student culture, making it a great choice if you are more of a social traveler looking to meet people. If you’re more of an introvert you can still visit the colleges of Oxford to really get a feel for the city and explore some of the college grounds. The land of ice and fire is surprisingly not as scary as it sounds. In fact, Reykjavik is one of the most safe cities in Europe to visit and thanks to a rise in tourism, is a great place to meet fellow travellers and locals all at once. The cafe scene in Reykjavik is pretty poppin’, too, so be sure to make time to wander from one cafe to the next. One of the things that surprised me most about this city was how many options there were for vegan food – both at regular restaurants and niche-specific vegan restaurants that were entirely plant based. This is a great city to spend a few days in before you venture off in to the depths of the country by road. Lisbon has long been one of my favourite cities to travel to as a solo female traveler as I have always felt incredibly safe, welcomed by locals and it is hands down one of the prettiest cities to get lost in. The capital of Croatia surprised me when I first visited, mostly because I hadn’t heard it was anything out of the ordinary and yet I loved my few days here, wandering around the streets and getting lost. Of course be sure not to miss (the more popular choice) Dubrovnik on the coast of Croatia, but don’t be too quick to pass up Zagreb as it is a great city to base yourself for a few days and feel like a local in no time. Switzerland is full of pretty cities and towns but for me, there is no city quite as beautiful as Zurich. I love visiting Zurich in the wintery months on my way to the ski slopes and could easily spend a few days here, cuddled up underneath a blanket outside one of the coffee shops drinking a cup of hot cocoa. Of all the times I have been to London I would say 90% of them have been solo and so, so incredibly enjoyable. With an abundance of free museums to visit and a great expat culture, there is always something to see or do in this city. London feels incredibly safe no matter the time of day, night, or season and with so many options for entertainment, is very easy to enjoy solo. I lived alone in Berlin for a few months back in 2015 and still remember that time so fondly. This city is effortlessly cool but also offers a great range of affordable restaurants, yoga classes, ever-changing coffee scene and a dark history that you could spend weeks on end uncovering. Belgium is not often the first choice for solo travelers but as one of the first destinations on my solo adventures many moons ago, I’ve got a soft spot for this country and in particular the city of Gent. Gent has a huge student population so it is easy to meet people and engage in the social scene or if you’re feeling like being on your own, this is a great city to get lost in without a map or any intentional destination. The Swedish capital city of Stockholm is known for its’ street style and indeed, is one of the most fashionable cities to discover. This is a great city to explore in three days and is especially lively on the summer weekends. With so many great cities and towns to visit in Italy, it can be difficult to narrow it down to suggest only the best Italian cities for solo travelers but if it is safety you are after, Florence, the capital of Tuscany is one of the most beautiful cities to explore on foot and is for the most part very safe. There are also some great day trips outside of Florence to enjoy, especially if you rent a car and head out in to the Italian countryside. The medieval city old town in Tallinn is perhaps the closest you will get to living in a real life fairytale. Wandering around this city could take you a day or it could take you a week, as the city is so beautiful you will often find yourself lost in the purity of it. The city of Bruges in Northern Flanders may just be my single most favourite city in all of Europe. This city is incredibly safe as a solo female traveler and is so picture perfect that you’ll be forgiven for thinking you’ve stepped inside a postcard. Follow @worldwanderlust on Instagram

130,"Norway is a country I have long had on my travel list (haven’t we all!?) and this summer I was lucky enough to visit for a cruise through the Norwegian Fjords with my mum in tow, on the Celebrity Eclipse ship with Celebrity Cruises. The 8 night cruise began in the South of England, making its way North to the famous west coast of Norway, where you will find oodles of postcard-perfect towns and villages, this the charming village of Flåm. This is undoubtedly one of the prettiest little villages in Norway and the perfect location to experience the famed Norwegian Fjords.  We arrived in the early hours of the morning and with the Norwegian weather being so unpredictable at the best of times (well, at least I suppose in winter you can expect snow, snow and more snow), we set off first thing to beat the chance of rain later in the day. This small village is best known for being the starting point to experience the Flåm Railway, which provides picturesque views from above on a relaxing one hour journey. The village itself is very small, with just a few small eateries and a handful of souvenir shops to cater to the summer cruise ships. If visiting for just one day as I did, I would suggest some sturdy walking shoes and hitting the trails to find great views around the town and small waterfront, or renting a bicycle to take you along the water to Aurland, a larger village 10 kilometres away.  As the Flåm Railway is the third steepest rail track in the world, it comes at no surprise that most visitors to the village take the hour-long journey through endless tunnels to take in those sweeping views from above. For those who prefer a more active escape, there are local kayak rentals and tours operating daily through the summer, which is another great way to see the fjord, except this time from the water. Cycling is another great way to see the area beyond the village, especially if you choose to ride the 10 kilometres to nearby Aurland. For those on a budget, you can also choose a range of hikes in the area by heading to the tourist information centre and choosing a hike that suits your level of fitness and the time you have available. For me, the best way to enjoy Flåm was just to walk around the village, the water’s edge, the nearby short hikes and to take it all in. "
131,"Berlin is edgy and ever-changing. With many expats and many more filing in by the week, the city has truly become an innovative hub for young people, start-ups, and collective work culture. If you so happen to find yourself in what I’d like to dub one of Europe’s coolest cities for young people, you’re gonna wanna work your way through this Berlin Bucket List in order to see, do, and eat your way around the city properly! Get ready, there’s a lot on offer!  You’ve just arrived so you’re probably hungry. Even if you’re not — try one. For the veggie and vegans out there fear not! Berlin is incredibly animal-free-food friendly, so a veg or vegan option won’t be too far away – just do a little research in advance. OH! mit fries = with fries, of course! Try: Curry 36. Next thing on the agenda – a bit of touristing. This 19th century Cathedral is pretty speccy and helps put into perspective the very many different architecture themes on offer in Berlin. …and a little more touristing. If its your first visit here, you can’t not! One of my favourite things to do whilst living in my Berlin apartment was to wander the few kilometres to Mauer Park on sundays and snag some bargains in the morning. Be sure to come early, this place is full of people from noon onwards! Time for a little history. Although most of the Berlin Wall was demolished long ago, parts of it have been restored in Wedding and Mitte as a sign of the past, whilst Berlin is always looking toward the future. You can learn much about the Berlin Wall and this period of history among the free information points, so be sure to spend some time here exploring and learning. The East Side Gallery is a section of the Berlin Wall that has been used as a form of expression, stretching around 1.3 kilometres in length and full of graffiti to commemorate freedom in Berlin. The gallery is really impressive and unique to Berlin, plus its free! YES! Was my first reaction when I learned about the old photo booth machines still in action throughout Berlin. If you’re walking around the city you’re bound to run into one, so be sure to carry some change (usually 4 euros) in order to hop in the booth and make a memory the old way! The Jewish history of Berlin is still very much seen throughout the city, especially at the artistic memorial designed by Jewish architect Daniel Libeskind. The memorial takes the shape of an exploding Star of David in the form of 2,711 blocks. For a more emotional walk through history, also visit the Holocaust museum whilst in Berlin. For the best view in Berlin, you’ll need to visit the Reichstag (home to the German government). Entrance is free but you’ll need to register in advance to secure a spot — entirely worth the little extra effort! If you’re a museums fan, you’re gonna be on cloud nine in Berlin as there’s much to see in the area known as Museum Island (which yes, is technically a little island). Located in Mitte (central), you could easily pass a day here visiting the many museums that cater to any and all interests.  One thing is for sure in Berlin: the food is great and I mean GREAT. If you’re after a burger and fries, look no further than the bird. It is also located in a really nice residential part of town to wander around, so be sure to spend some time here in the leafy wonderland! The bird: Am Falkplatz 5 So you might not need to come here for any other reason than shopping, but if you like busy crowds and streets full of people then Potsdamer Platz can be pretty fun to have a look around. Because who doesn’t like picnics!? Of course, you’ll need to be in Berlin in the summer for this… winters can be pretty harsh, dull and grey! Back to some touristing around the city: you really can’t come to Berlin without spotting Checkpoint Charlie, the most known checkpoint in the city that still looks today as it did decades ago. If you’re like me and like to find the coolest neighbourhood in town and explore it like a local, then be sure to hop on some transport of any kind and make your way over to Kreuzberg; surely Berlin’s coolest neighbourhood to explore. Because you’re in Germany of course! Now for legal reasons I can’t really tell you to do it, but there is a slightly higher than normal probability I have done it myself (check out this video) and it was a fun/fun on the fun scale. Luckily I didn’t get caught (my friend did) and I’ll be honest and say there wasn’t a whole lot of backlash. Seriously if you’re up for a lil’ thrill, this is a fun adventure (its called Spreepark if you wanna do some more research). If you’re lucky enough to be in Berlin during November/December (or unlucky if you don’t like the cold weather!!) then you simply must visit the German Christmas Markets. Gendarmenmarkt is my all time fave and always full of lots of locals. If you like street food and you’re up for anything (anything good, mind you), then make your way over to street food thursdays between 5-10pm at Markthalle Neun. One thing is for sure when visiting Berlin – you’ll soon realise this city is HUGE. Do as the locals do and rent a bike for the day to get around and tick the above items off the list… otherwise, you’ll be here a whole week or more! "
132,"Inviting and mysterious, the medieval old town of Tallinn is a welcoming balance of intrigue and a picture-perfect postcard. The old town is so well preserved that you’d be forgiven for pinching yourself and questioning reality – it really is too cute! Whether you’re spending a few days in the city or visiting on a day trip from Helsinki, here are the absolute best 10 things to do in Tallinn! As the central point of the old town, the Market Square is a great place to commence your meanderings through the cobblestone streets. From here you can already get a great idea of the vibrancy this city offers and within a 360-degree turn you will see the set of Game of Thrones come to life (minus the tourists, of course). Many will tell you that the best view of Tallinn is found on top of Toompea. While this is a beautiful view, sure, it isn’t quite the best view of the city from above (read on to find out where you’ll find the very best view!) Toompea is a neighbourhood overlooking the old town and it is here where you will also find the St Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. Located high on the hill of Toompea, St Alexander Nevsky Cathedral is a beautiful church of the traditional Orthodox faith. The cathedral was built in 1900, when Estonia was still a part of the Russian Empire. Although photographs aren’t allowed inside, you should take the time to step inside the cathedral and look around to marvel at the ornate architecture, mosaics and gold candelabras (besides, entrance is free!) It surprises me how many visitors to Tallinn don’t make their way up the 258 stairs to the top of St Olav’s Church, which arguably has the best view of the old town. The tower dates back to 1267 and has previously been used to beacon approaching ships and as a KGB watch tower, though nowadays it is one of the must do tourist attractions in the city. It will cost you 3 euros to enter – a small price to pay for those picture perfect photographs! One of Tallinn’s greatest pleasures is just to wander for hours through the winding cobblestone streets. The old streets are incredibly photogenic with their pastel coloured buildings, unique shapes and my personal favourite: the colourful doors of Tallinn! The prettiest streets I stumbled upon were Pikk (the longest street in the old town) and Katariina käik. The beauty of Tallinn is often found in its ability to remain in another era. Located in the market square, the town hall pharmacy is where you will find powdered unicorn horn, mummy juice, and all kinds of quirkiness. The pharmacy is believed to be Europe’s longest running pharmacy and was once a favourite of the Russian tsars. Keep in mind the pharmacy is unfortunately closed on Sundays. Another great view over the city is found when wandering along the medieval walls surrounding the old town. Once you have finished walking the walls, make your way over to kiek in de kök to learn about Tallinn’s defence history. To this day you can view the cannonballs left behind by Ivan the Terrible during the Livonian War. After a long day of wandering the streets of the old town, make your way to the cutest (and tastiest) pastry shop in town, Rukis. Located on Viru Street, this pastry shop is full of temptations and at 2 and 3 euros a piece, its difficult to say no! Located opposite St Alexander Nevsky Cathedral is Toompea Castle, which now houses the Parliament of Estonia but was once an ancient stronghold, used since the 9th century. If you’re visiting more of Estonia and haven’t arrived by ferry from Helsinki, then be sure to make a day trip two hours north to Finland! Helsinki is the complete opposite to Tallinn and offers a more urban experience, particularly appealing to design lovers and cafe hunters.  I flew to Europe with Finnair, arriving in Helsinki (capital of Finland) at 6:00am, before taking the two hour morning ferry to Tallinn. Purchasing a ticket at the ferry port cost me 35 euros return on the Viking Line, which is the easiest/most accessible port if you are staying in the centre of Helsinki. The ferry offers free wi-fi and affordable food options (though they do leave a little to be desired!)"
133,"Knowing when to go to Europe can make or break your trip. Each season has its benefits and pitfalls, but it is no secret that avoiding the summer crowds will result in lower prices and wait times to enter attractions. But low season in Europe also results in the closure of many establishments and some small towns close down altogether! So if you’re wandering when to go to Europe, here’s our complete guide!  Mid-June through August Summer in Europe is still a great season to travel in, but you’ll need to be prepared for crowds or know how to avoid them. If you’re travelling to popular cities on the typical European itinerary (think Paris; Rome; Venice; Barcelona; Amsterdam) then you’ll have no choice but to brave the crowds. The best way to avoid crowds is to arrive 30 minutes before opening time for your preferred attraction and be first in line to visit that morning. Of course you’ll only be able to do this for one attraction per day, so choose wisely! Otherwise pick off the beaten path cities to visit like Istanbul or Budapest where crowds will be lighter (but still busy – believe me!) In terms of temperatures, you can expect really hot summer days throughout Europe during summer. Be sure to pack a pair of comfy shoes to make it through the day, but also don’t forget a hat, sunglasses and sunblock. To avoid crowds in popular day visit cities (like Bruges in Belgium or Cesky Krumlov in Czech Republic), stay a night to see the city at dusk or before the crowds arrive at dawn. Keep in mind that some places are indeed best visited in peak season! For example in small European towns like Hallstatt in Austria, the city all but closes up for the colder months. Thus travelling in the warmer months can sometimes be a necessity if you have particular places in mind. Read more: Escape the crowds: 10 cities in Europe to escape the crowds in summer  November through March Lets talk about low season – perhaps my all time favourite time to travel in Europe! Sure, I like the cold, so it is certainly not for everyone… but please, let me plead my case! Low season in Europe almost always means low rates (December, January, February), save for the exceptions of Christmas and New Years. Hotels are often heavily discounted and can be found for as much as half the usual rates! Cities like Budapest in Hungary are incredibly cheap in low season as the supply for accommodation is high but the visitation levels are low. Heading further east to Romania will only result in saving more dollars! This is indeed winter season in Europe, but it can often be the prettiest time to explore a city – with snow covered streets and a charming blue haze throughout the day as the sun struggles to break through. Be prepared for closures of some cities altogether, or disruptions to services due to the weather. Also be aware that winter in Europe results in much shorter days, with some cities in the North barely seeing the sun at all. Read more: Where to go in Europe in winter  April through mid-June and September through October My second favourite time to travel throughout Europe is in the shoulder seasons of Spring (March-May) and Autumn (September-November). Be aware that shoulder season doesn’t necessarily fall directly into these seasons, as countries like Italy and France can often see higher visitation levels in these seasons and thus result in hardly any change in price from summer rates. However if you get off the beaten path and head to small towns outside of capital cities, there is not only money to be saved but much to be enjoyed in these seasons. Locals are noticeably much happier outside of the busy summer rush and visitors are fewer than in the warmer months. This begs the question… spring or autumn? Personally I prefer spring as you can enjoy Europe BEFORE the crowds come in by the masses and spoil the attitudes of locals who are eagerly working up towards their holidays. Plus a little spring time blossom makes for extremely pretty pictures! Read more: Where to go in Europe in Spring"
134,"Florence (Firenze) is a city so steeped in history that it can seem almost impossible to see and do everything, even if you’ve allowed a week to explore. However if you do manage to allow for a day out of the hustle and bustle and escape to the countryside, these are the best small cities and towns to venture toward in our guide to the best day trips from Florence. In just over an hour by train or hour you can reach Lucca, a smaller city in the Tuscany region but with a great amount of charm! Lucca is very different to Florence and offers a more relaxed day away from the crowds, however in the warmer months this is easily one of the most popular day trips from Florence. Be sure to climb your way to the top of the Bell Tower, but be prepared for a sweat session as you battle 230 steps to the top!   Thanks to a flawed attempt at constructing a tower, Pisa has become a must visit destination for most visitors to Italy. Pisa and Lucca can easily be visited in one day trip from Florence, as both are a little over an hour away from Florence and practically situated next door to one another. If you’re up for a longer trip and have a full day to spare, the journey to Cinque Terre by train is approximately 2.5-3 hours one way. For some time now this has been one of Italy’s main attractions and bucket list items, so for many travellers the distance is not a deterrent. Be sure to plan your journey in advance as there will be some train changes along the way. If wine, cheese and the Tuscan countryside is more appealing to you, then you can’t go past a visit to the Chianti wine region. The best way to embark on the journey is to hire a car for the day and take in the summer breeze as you make your way through the rolling hills of Tuscany. Heading south, Siena is another great city in the region of Tuscany with a completely different atmosphere to Florence and also reachable in just over an hour by road or train. Along the way you might consider a stop off in San Gimignano (below), one of the most gorgeous little towns in the entire country and also home to the world’s best gelato! Should you make the journey to Siena, you really cannot afford to miss a pit stop at San Gimignano. This small town on a hill is surrounded by 13th-century walls and although small in size, has enough charm to warrant a few hours to walk around and take in the views from the bell tower.

135,"I checked in to the Regent Porto Montenegro almost by accident. I was invited to speak at the Spark media conference and before I knew it, I was flying halfway across the world. The Regent Porto Montenegro was where I was hosted for the conference. But it quickly became more than a business trip, as I opted to stay for another two weeks. Instead of staying for just two days, I booked two weeks in Montenegro. I arrived with no plans whatsoever (beyond the conference of course). I ended up staying at the Regent Porto Montenegro for a glorious seven nights. This hotel really became my home for the week! The Regent is a great place to base yourself and explore the surrounding towns. There is much to see and do in the South of Montenegro. So much so, that you’d need at least a week to see it all. Two weeks is enough time to see the entire country. The hotel is new and it shows. It was opened in 2014 and no expense was spared in creating this luxurious hotel. It was to be the first of its kind on the southwest coast of Montenegro. But aside from the obvious luxuries, it was the staff who really made my stay so memorable. There were always smiling faces at every turn who mostly all knew me by name. Every time I passed reception I’d stop for a quick chat with the staff. The rooms at Porto Montenegro are huge and there’s nothing you will need to bring yourself. All the amenities are thought of including bath salts and body scrubs. Plus a very warm welcome to my life on the road; a Nespresso machine. Breakfast is included in your room rate and it is an event you don’t want to miss. A good buffet breakfast is a guarantee we all need to a good day. Fortunately, I found the Regent to have just that. There is a buffet full of hot and cold options (croissants, granola, breakfast tarts and more). But it is the a la carte menu items that will really impress. Truffle eggs? Yes, please! I went back to Murano Restaurant for both lunch and dinner throughout my stay. The menu is well priced for the level of service and food. Even if you aren’t staying at the hotel I’d recommend dropping by for an evening meal. The Gourmet Corner Bakery on the side of the hotel is where I spent most of my days. Each day I would pull up a chair, order coffee and a croissant and work on my laptop. Make sure you order the carrot cake (you can thank me later). Throughout my week-long stay (perhaps the longest I’ve stayed in one place let alone the same hotel) I made use of all the facilities. This included a 24-hour gym, nail salon, spa, two swimming pools and my beloved room service. There’s nothing better than ordering a carb-heavy pasta dish at 11:00 pm because you can. Room rates start at €350 for a one bedroom and €620 for a suite. I would recommend the Venezia Wing of the hotel for the iconic Regent experience. Room 411 will give you a great view of the shops and marina below. Whereas room 415A is a front-facing view toward the entire marina and is perfect for the best sunsets. This was personally my favourite room view (after trying both). Follow along on Instagram for more travel updates!"
136,"As far as cities go, Istanbul is hands down one of the most intriguing and inspiring. This city is so full of fascination at every turn, that it can quite easily become overwhelming, whether visiting for a couple of days or a couple of weeks. And with that, the Istanbul Bucket List was born! In light of the recent events that have shaken this city, I think it is important to remember and celebrate, just as I suggested in the wake of Paris, just how beautiful this city is. With so much history – from Byzantium to Constantinople to Istanbul as we know it today, this city is one of the most intriguing to visit the world over. Thus is you have plans to visit and are looking for some encouragement, here are some great ideas to encourage you to visit Istanbul! No matter how much time you spend in Istanbul I’m almost certain you will never “see it all”, but to make sure you see, do and eat your way through the Turkish capital to the best of your ability, I’ve gathered an Istanbul Bucket List full of everything you can’t miss! Let the games begin!  To get an instant feel of just how much this city has changed over the years, step inside Hagia Sophia – once a Christian basilica, then a mosque, and now finally, a museum. This monument was important both in Byzantium times and throughout the Ottoman Empire, with so much history that you could quite literally spend an entire day here (which might be the case by the time you get to the front of the line!) Chances are you’ve seen a video or images before of the mesmerising (and somewhat nauseating) Whirling Dervishes – so what better chance than to see them perform here in Turkey! Of course the best chance to see them perform is in Konya, but in Istanbul you still have a handful of great performances to enjoy. Arguably the best chance to see them perform is at the Galata Mevlevi Museum on Sunday evenings at 17:00. Tickets go on sale at the location around noon on the day of performance. Instead of asking where to get the best Döner in Istanbul, you might find yourself asking if there are indeed any bad versions? If this city knows one thing extraordinarily well, it is food.  The Bosphorus bridge is what connects Europe with Asia, thus leading to the references of a “European side” to Istanbul and an “Asian side” to Istanbul. What amazed me during my visit is that there is indeed a big difference between the two, with the heart of Istanbul (European side) being heavily commercialised, incredibly busy with crowds, etc. and the Asian side being a complete contrast: calm and much less developed. To see it for yourself, be sure to cross the Bosphorus and visit both sides – or at the very least take a cruise along the river to see the city from afar. One of my favourite activities in Istanbul was to try a traditional Turkish Hammam (spa activities are hard not to enjoy!) But this was a spa treatment with a difference. The ritual focuses more on water and cleansing rather than traditional Roman baths where steam bathing is the primary activity. I found my experience to be invigorating and unique – would totally recommend!  When strolling around Istanbul you will often see a tower that stands out amongst the cluttered buildings and immediately the thought of a great view will come to mind – trust that instinct! The Galata Tower has one of the best views in the entire city, though at around $9 is a pretty hefty entrance fee when you can get a similar view from rooftop bars (take your pick!)  While popularly known as the Blue Mosque with thanks to its’ appearance, Sultan Ahmed Mosque is the formal title of this still active place of worship. The best way to see the mosque is to take a Westerly approach, approaching the Hippodrome. When visiting remember to cover your legs and for ladies a head scarf is required. Once the residence of Turkish Sultans from the Ottoman Empire, Topkapi Palace is a great chance to brush up on your Turkish history or just to see how the other half lived! Entrance is around 30 Turkish Lira (around $14) and since this is one of the most popular attractions in the city I’d recommend arriving at opening time (9 am!) If you’re after a view of the city you won’t have any trouble finding one – rooftop bars in Istanbul are increasingly popular and offer a great chance to see the city at night! Some popular choices include: Le Fumoir in Galata, Raika in Taksim Square and Mikla (arguably the best view in all of Istanbul!)  I mean it when I say – you have not lived until you have tasted Turkish Baklava in its’ mother country. This deliciously sweet and indulgent pastry is an all time favourite of mine, though I have been constantly introducing it to sceptics over the years! (If you’re keen to try at home before you go or recreate once home, there’s a great recipe here). Although being a vegetarian I don’t eat seafood, I still enjoyed walking along the base of Galata bridge to soak up the atmosphere at lunch time! If you enjoy seafood this is where you’ll find the best on offer in the city, though the street food vendors on either side of the bridge offer amazing alternatives (and are very cheap!) If you like potatoes, you’re in for a real treat. A Kumpir is incredibly popular among locals and could be said to be the Turkish equivalent of a hot jacket potato. This is a great street food option for veggies AND meat eaters as you can get plenty of variations on toppings!  After seeing a line that replicated a serpent winding for hundreds of metres to enter Hagia Sophia, I decided to look elsewhere to fill in time in the area and wait for the line to die down. I wound up at Basilica Cistern, which didn’t really interest me at first but I’m so glad I went in for a look! This is the largest and most impressive cistern lying underneath Istanbul and definitely worth a look (even if it is a tiny bit creepy inside!)  While most trams in Istanbul are modern, there is one that remains old-fashioned for visitors to the city to feel as if they have stepped back in time. The İstiklal Caddesi tram (red street tram) connects Taksim Square with Galatasaray and Tünel Square and is more a novelty than anything… but a good ol’ serving of nostalgia nonetheless! If you want to step inside a time warp and feel as if you’ve been transported back to the days of Byzantium or Constantinople, then look no further than Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar. Full of trinkets and treasures, there quite literally is no other market in the world quite as enchanting.  Whilst at the Grand Bazaar, be sure not to walk away without a trinket of some kind. The colourful glass lamps are a crowd pleaser (and start a great conversation back home) but don’t be afraid to grab a handful of goodies to take home – who knows when you’ll be back! I’d recommend tea anywhere, but if you’re up for something different and unique, be sure to try Turkish tea. Teamed with some pastries this makes for a great afternoon treat after a day of exploring Istanbul on foot. By far and large, the Jewish Quarter was my favourite neighbourhood to walk around in Istanbul and I’m sure you will enjoy it just as much! Although there are lots (and I do mean LOTS) of stairs to conquer, this area is full of great souvenir stalls, boutiques and handicrafts. It also has a stellar view of the cities’ rooftops and Bosphorus in the distance – hard to beat!  Located adjacent to the Grand Bazaar is one of the most colourful areas of the city – the spice markets. Even if you don’t try or buy anything, this is a great place to come for interesting photographs and interacting with the friendly locals! Although I’m not a huge fan of Turkish Delights, I concluded with myself that “When in Rome” was applicable here. Covered in a little powdered sugar dusting they aren’t too bad – though I’m more inclined to stick with the pastries if given the choice! If there’s just one thing I remember about Istanbul its the heat… and I wasn’t even there in the heat of summer! One of the best ways to negate heatstroke is to make use of the many juice stalls and soft serve ice creameries… believe me when I say they are there for a reason!"
137,"After more than a hand full of visits to Paris over the past few years, I’ve come to learn that in order to know Paris one must visit often but never too often, so as to keep the love for Paris alive. Over the years I have also learned that the guidebooks are typically wrong and the best of Paris must be found beyond the overpriced cafes, beyond the “best” neighbourhoods (each offers their own unique flair) and beyond the French stereotypes. I have also learned that to truly be a part of Paris you must walk. Thus for miles and miles I have walked all over Paris throughout the years and on my last visit I finally started to feel as though my relentless self-guided walking tours have finally come to cover the best that Paris has to offer. So if you’re looking for neighbourhoods to wander, below are my top highlights!  There’s a lot to see in Paris by way of attractions, but you will soon find these are spread widely apart and a better plan of action is to wander at leisure, stumbling across the big names as you venture on. Starting in the 1st arrondissement, you will find plenty of charming cafes dotting Rue Rivoli, also known as the home address to the Louvre Museum. This street is also a mecca for international shopping brands, though there are plenty of prettier places to shop in Paris so better to leave the temptations until later. After strolling past or through the Louvre (depending on your tolerance for queues), be sure to venture onwards through the Tuileries gardens. Here you can enjoy a light snack at one of the pop up stalls or carry on walking away from the crowds. Near to the Louvre museum you will find a concept store that has become a destination in itself; Colette. Here you can find a range of goodies, from fashion through to tech gear. My favourite part of the store is the book selection as they offer a few hidden treasures in both French and English. If you’re looking for dinner in the heart of Paris, try the typically French (and outrageously delicious) Racines – a classic but contemporary bistronomique.  It was only in the last couple of years that I was properly introduced to Le Marais and only on my recent visit to Paris that I really started to explore this arrondissement more in depth. Le Marais is a renowned eating neighbourhood in Paris and thus best visited around lunch time so you can truly appreciate all the offerings. Walking around the area without a mapped plan is typically the best way to see Le Marais. Be sure to make a pit stop at Place des Vosges to catch a little summer sun and if you’re looking for a sweet treat to accompany you, Carette have some of the best salted butter caramel macarons I have ever tasted. Read more: A Complete Guide to Le Marais.  For a very long time this has been my favourite neighbourhood in all of Paris. That is, of course, until I recently started to discover Le Marais after being taken out to dinner there by a Parisian, followed by staying in Le Marais on my most recent visit to Paris. But back to Saint Germain! This area is renowned for its boutique shopping, particularly if you enjoy nabbing a vintage bargain. The area also has many cafes worth visiting, including the famous (and famously busy) Cafe de Flore &  equally famous Deux Margots. Walking around the arrondissement, be sure not to miss the chance to stroll through the Luxembourg Gardens – some of the prettiest in the entire city. I find this area most enjoyable in the later afternoon, coupled with an afterwards visit to the Latin Quarter for a cheap evening meal. Read more: A complete guide to Saint-Germain-des-Prés.  I come to the Latin Quarter in Paris for one main reason: the food. The food in the Latin Quarter comes from all over the world (though really centres around Moroccan, Asian, and Middle Eastern cuisines), it is cheap and it is darn good. You can’t go wrong with a street serving of falafel or a kebab, but if you’re looking for specifics: Little Cantine – Jolly good burgers. Maoz – Vegetarian falafel in pita bread or salad bowl. Au P’tit grac – Desserts & Pastries. La Maison de Verlaine – Typical French food. Coutume Instituutti – The best coffee in the neighbourhood. Chez Nicos – Crêpes.  Onwards and beginning to cross the Seine River, you will find yourself almost immediately in front of Notre Dame Cathedral, home to one of the best views in Paris if you are willing to withstand the queue to enter the towers (located on the left of the cathedral when facing it). Also impressive and if you ask me not to be missed is Saint Chapelle, just a five minute stroll from Notre Dame and with the most impressive stained-glass windows you will find in Paris and perhaps all of Europe! Although this is an incredibly small area to walk around, navigating your way through the winding streets and alleys will lead to hidden treasures. From Ile de la Cité be sure to wander onwards to Île St-Louis for arguably the best ice cream in Paris at Berthillon.  No matter what the naysayers will lead you to believe, I am whole heartedly of the opinion that some of the best of Paris is still located in Montmartre. Sure, it is more touristic nowadays and many artists cannot afford the hiking rent, but remember there are two ways to see Montmartre: The first is to wander the backstreets, get lost, find hidden gems, stop for coffee, bite into a crêpe while you stroll the streets and discover why this has for centuries been the Artist Quarter of Paris. The second is to walk up the stairs to Sacre Couer, snap a view of smoggy Paris, allow yourself to be conned into a cartoon drawing of your best-dressed-self and pay for an overpriced meal in the al fresco dining area. I’ll leave it up to you! Somewhere between the two (leaning towards the former) usually works. Or, you can follow this route: Take the metro to Abbesses station where you will enter the heart of Montmartre, make your way up the hill towards Sacre Coeur, wander back through the alleyways and stumble upon the Moulin Rouge, followed by an interesting stroll back to Pigalle metro station.

138," There are few times in life I have been so convinced that I have stepped into a fairytale picture book and suffice it so say that Beaune is one such place I believe magic has occurred. Just like the towns of a Disney film or my all-time favourite film Chocolat, Beaune has an otherworldly appeal unlike any other French town. Dainty and prettier than a postcard, this town is just a few hours from Paris and should be a staple in any French discovery tour. So, what are you waiting for? Here is your complete guide to Beaune!  Musee de l’Hotel-Dieu At the centre of town is Beaune’s most iconic architectural structure: the musee de l’Hotel-Dieu. This former hospital built in the 15th century is without a doubt the town’s most recognisable structure and a good point of reference as you peruse the winding streets that are not only illogically formed, but extremely uneven – so watch where you’re going! Saturday Markets  Every Saturday the small towns and villages of France come to life with the sights, sounds and smells of market day. Beaune is no exception. Whether you’re looking for smelly cheese or one cute dog watch, there’s plenty of taste testers and pooch’s to admire as you wade through the crowds from one vendor to the next. As the wine capital of Burgundy, there’s plenty of great drops to enjoy and equally good food to be found in a handful of restaurant categories. The most memorable restaurants I found were out in the countryside – housed in real kitchens, countryside manors or as roadtrip stops with thanks to the popularity of the Michelin guide in France. In Beaune itself I often found myself passing time in small cafes and patisseries, fuelling up with carbs before a day cycling through the French countryside (as athletic as that may sound, I was often cycling from one cellar door to the next). Upper Coffee Shop This cute little coffee shop is a personal favourite in town. The coffee is good (surprisingly still a difficult feat in France) and the prices are friendly like the staff. Patisserie Fabien Berteau Before arriving to Beaune I had done some prior research to discover where to find the best macarons: Patisserie Fabien Berteau was the unanimous winner. As it turns out the macarons were immemorable, but the tangy lemon tart was one of the best I’ve ever had and subsequently lasted an entirety of 4 seconds in my hands before it was completely devoured.  As Beaune is the wine capital of Burgundy, there are many vineyards and open cellar doors to experience the regional wines in their many varietals. I would suggest hiring a bike for the day, asking for a map of the region, and setting off to cycle between towns and chateaus – stopping at wherever tickles your fancy along the way.  For my stay in town, I checked in to the glorious Hotel Le Cep – a highly celebrated family-owned hotel located just a few minutes from the centre of town. Each of the rooms are decorated in unique colours and fabrics, making for a unique experience every time you visit.  September through November are considered the best times of year to visit Beaune and theBurgundy region, though I would argue there really is no bad time to visit. My first visit to Beaune in September was full of sunshine and clear blue skies and my most recent visit was more grey and moody in April. If you’re hoping for the best weather, June-August are the summer months but also the busiest. Thus to have the best of both worlds, the best time of year is between summer and winter in September, October or November. I visited the city of Beaune on a 7 day river cruise with Avalon Waterways. All opinions and photos are my own and I’d highly recommend taking the time to enjoy a river cruise for those preferring a more relaxed approach to visiting France! "
139,"So you want to travel solo in Europe? These cities are great for solo travellers! After recently catching up with a friend over coffee to plan her 2017 solo European summer journey, I realised it must be time for a refresher on the blog of the best cities to travel solo in Europe. After travelling solo through most of Europe over the past four years blogging and a solo trip to Europe at 20 years of age before that, I have seen first hand how rewarding and life changing solo travel in Europe can be. The beauty of Europe is that you can fall asleep in one city and wake up in another, crossing over borders and cultures simultaneously in a matter of hours. With so much to see and do in the region it can often be difficult knowing where to start. So I present to you my favourite cities in Europe for solo travel!  Although Budapest has built a reputation over the past decade as a must-visit city in Europe, the capital of Hungary remains one of the cheapest capital cities to visit in Europe, making it a great destination for solo travellers on a budget. Budapest is also a city full of attractions, monuments and unique neighbourhoods to discover, giving solo travellers plenty of activities to keep busy and intrigued. Best for: Lively nightlife, Expats, History, Low cost Cost: $15-$90 for a 3 star hotel room // $2-$4 for a local budget lunch When I first travelled to Vienna solo five years ago I had no idea just how sprawling this city would be. Imperial and imposing, Vienna is full of history, art culture, cafe culture and museums galore. You certainly won’t run out of things to do here! Best for: History & Art culture Cost:  $43-$175 for a 3 star hotel // $5-$9 for a local budget lunch Although rapidly increasing in terms of visitors and cost, Prague is still one of those quintessential cities you must visit on a solo trip through Europe. With plenty of travellers passing through the city, you won’t find any shortage of new friends, making this a great city to escape day through the night! Best for: Lively nightlife, History Cost: $20-$165 for a 3 star hotel // $4-$7 for a local budget lunch Not only is Ljubljana one of the most underrated capital cities in all of Europe but it is also a great city to visit solo as a base to explore Slovenia. As a country filled with natural beauty, Slovenia and its capital city are a great choice for the more active solo traveller. Best for: Off the beaten path Cost: $36-$151 for a 3 star hotel // $4-$8 for a local budget lunch As one of my first cities I visited solo on my year of adventures, Amsterdam will always hold a special place for me as one of the most beautiful, surreal cities to travel to solo and particularly so in winter (without the summer crowds!) Given this is such a hot spot destination for young travellers you are bound to meet plenty of fellow solo travellers, making this a great city to meet people and enjoy the historic sites around the city. Best for: Lively nightlife, charm, friendly locals Cost: $588-$218 for a 3 star hotel // $4-$8 for a local budget lunch While certainly not a budget destination by any means, London remains one of the greatest cities to travel solo thanks to the endless amount of activities on offer. Once you’ve worked your way through Central London (Big Ben, Westminster, St Paul’s, etc.) be sure to check out other neighbourhoods with more grungy, old school appeal. Shoreditch is a great starting point! Best for: Activities, sightseeing, nightlife Cost: $54-$323 for a 3 star hotel // $7-$12 for a budget local lunch This list would certainly not be complete without mention of my old stomping grounds: Berlin. This city is brimming with fabulous nightlife, cheap eats, and plenty of expats from all corners of the globe. Best for: Expats, Central location Cost: $25-$155 for a 3 star hotel // $4-$10 for a local budget lunch Almost any list containing the best cities in Europe no matter what the classification, would be incomplete without mention of Paris! Although an expensive city to visit in terms of accommodation, Paris is relatively affordable if you’re in the know. Be sure to check out the Latin Quarter for cheap eats, don’t be afraid of the language barrier and remember the best way to see this city is free (on foot!) Best for: Culture, Sightseeing, Charm Cost: $70-$372 for a 3 star hotel // $6-$10 for a local budget lunch When you think of Spain you’ll be forgiven for thinking straight to Barcelona – one of Europe’s most trending cities for young travellers, especially if you’re riding solo! You will be thrilled by the generosity, kindness and hospitality of residents here and believe me when I say this is a difficult city not to enjoy! Best for: Lively nightlife, Expats, Food Cost: $38-$323 for a 3 star hotel // $5-$9 for a local budget lunch Although much more discovered today than it was five or six years ago, Lisbon still retains a lot of hidden charm to be discovered. Visiting this solo is great due to the low cost, charm and colour of the city that has a way of bringing a smile to your face. Best for: Charm, Low cost Cost: $27-$151 for a 3 star hotel // $4-$8 for a local budget lunch As one of the prettiest cities in Italy and absolutely full of history and art culture, there is no way that any solo traveller would not enjoy Florence. With plenty of expat students studying in the city you won’t have any trouble meeting people, which is also a great way to explore the city with someone in the know! Best for: History, Art, Culture Cost: $41-$209 for a 3 star hotel // $5-$10 for a local budget lunch Ahhh Rome… the eternal city! If you happen to be a solo traveller that needs to keep busy, you’ll be sure to find endless options of things to see and do in Rome. This is a bucket list city that every traveller should be able to experience at least once in their life, so be sure to allow yourself a decent amount of time to explore it. Best for: History (lots of it!) Cost: $30-$317 for a 3 star hotel // $5-$10 for a local budget lunch Another great city to find yourself in Italy is Naples – even if it is only for the pizza!!! Naples is of course where pizza began, but it is also the gateway to the Amalfi coast – my absolute favourite area to explore in Italy (though in all honesty there are many!) Best for: Gateway to the Amalfi, Pizza Cost: $23-$126 for a 3 star hotel // $4-$7 for a local budget lunch Although Belgium is not often the first choice in Europe, I can promise you from first-hand experience it is a destination you will not regret visiting. Belgium is full of charming towns and cities, none that surprised me more than Antwerp – a fashion-forward city full of young people, great coffee and a great downtown area to explore solo. Best for: Nightlife, coffee scene, city explorations Cost: $43-$177 for a 3 star hotel // $6-$10 for a local budget lunch Another city I adored travelling solo through is Gent, just a short train ride from the better known nearby city of Brugges (which is, of course, gorgeous too!) Gent is a great choice for solo travellers as it has a huge student population, making it a fun city to go out in of a night time and meet the local crowds. Best for: Student nightlife, charm Cost: $52-$168 for a 3 star hotel // $5-$8 for a local budget lunch The capital of Poland, Warsaw, was a city I managed to overlook on my first visit to Poland but on my second visit I am so glad I made the decision to visit the capital. Warsaw is a paradox at every turn, with various architecture styles taking you through various points in history. Best for: Modern world history, Low cost Cost: $28-$95 for a 3 star hotel // $2-$4 for a local budget lunch Another city I thoroughly enjoyed visiting in Poland is Krakow, located in the South of Poland and also with a lot of history to discover. If you’re a history buff like me you will already have this city on your must visit list, especially if interested in modern world history in the region. Krakow also has a huge student population, giving it a great nightlife and plenty of friendly locals to meet! Best for: Modern world history, student nightlife, charm Cost: $27-$108 for a 3 star hotel // $2-$5 for a local budget lunch One destination that has truly flung itself on to solo travellers in the past few years is Croatia and in particular, Dubrovnik. This coastal town is anything but sleepy, attracting young travellers from all over the globe by the droves. This is a great place to meet fellow travellers or begin a new adventure, sailing the coast in a Northerly direction towards Split. Best for: Scenery, Charm, Coastal town Cost: $33-$250 for a 3 star hotel // $4-$8 for a local budget lunch Although less talked about, Riga is one of Europe’s most underrated capital cities. Full of charm and not nearly as full of tourists as other capital cities, Riga is a true gem to stopover for a couple of days exploring. If you plan to venture even further away from the crowds, you will find Latvia a great place to do so beyond the capital. Best for: Meeting locals, Charm Cost: $19-$72 for a 3 star hotel // $3-$6 for a local budget lunch Last but not least – Tallinn! This gorgeous little capital took my heart in just a day as it often does for many visitors who make their way here on a ferry day trip from nearby Helsinki. I adored this city for its old world charm, friendly locals and al fresco dining culture in the summer. Best for: Meeting locals, Charm Cost: $38-$102 for a 3 star hotel // $3-$8 for a local budget lunch  See more of my adventures on Instagram"
140,"Each year I make what has unintentionally become an annual pilgrimage to Paris. As if I need an annual ‘hit’ of the city that inspires me most, I conjure up any and every excuse to visit and spend months planning all the new eateries I will visit (which more often than not are patisseries). Below you will find snapshots of my week in Paris this month, where I pushed the boundaries of sweet tooth, burned my way through a pair of shoes from so much walking, and finally had the chance to visit the Gardens of Versailles, which were closed on my last visit in the unseasonal month of January. So, here we go! As per usual, you’ll find all my camera/lens details at the bottom of the post and commentary throughout should you wish to visit the same places. I hope you enjoy taking a peek inside my Paris photo diary!  Old vs. New. It is no secret I visit Angelina on every trip to Paris, but on this trip I was excited to find new finds, especially if they were less talked about or written about in magazines. Au Petit Versailles was one such fab little find in Le Marais. The quiches made for a perfectly cheap breakfast each morning!  Spring is still my favourite month to visit Paris as the whole city really ‘springs’ to life. The cherry blossoms are best viewed in April (see those from last year’s visit), but the weather is still really pleasant in May and the crowds aren’t quite as crazy as June-August.  Walking around the Île de la Cité is still one of my favourite ways to spend an afternoon in Paris.  The secret passages of Paris became one of my favourite finds on this trip – I stumbled upon the first few and then made it my mission to visit them all (which didn’t happen, mostly because I spent so much time in each!)  Have you heard of the concept store “Merci”? If you haven’t, write it down! The outside of the store is deceiving – this store is huuuuuge and full of the most beautiful collection of French clothes + homewares.  On this trip I spent a morning in Canal Saint Martin, one of the neighbourhoods featured in Amelie (the French film – I hope you know the one!) Be sure to visit Du Pain et Idees for some of the best pastries in all of Paris. Period.  More passages! These were Paris’ older styled shopping streets, many of which were destroyed to make for grand boulevards like you will see in most of Paris. Thankfully some 40-odd still remain.  Lets talk about the weather in May: was it hot or was it cold? My outfits changed so much daily! The weather was incredibly changeable throughout my stay: hot and sweaty one day, cool enough for a jacket the next. You have been warned.  Vegan or travelling with someone who is? Make sure to visit Wild and the Moon in Le Marais for some seeeeeriously good eats. Acai bowls, matcha tea lattes, all of the trends.  On the last two trips I have found myself staying in Le Marais, after falling in love with it the trip before when I friend took me to the neighbourhood for dinner. Le Marais for me feels like the ‘real’ Paris (whatever that is, if anything).   My other favourite ‘hood is Montmartre, which is also the neighbourhood I stayed in when I visited Paris for the first time with my father when I was seventeen. I still remember catching the metro and carrying our heavy suitcases up the stairs that never seemed to end, only to arrive at a hotel on the 6th floor that had no elevator.  For the best cheap eats in Paris you still can’t beat the Latin Quarter, ironically located next door to Saint Germain des Pres (one of my other favourite neighbourhoods but in contrast incredibly expensive!)  Macarons from my favourite patisserie/cafe, Carette! These ones I purchased at the Trocadero location, which is only a 5-10 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower.  A new favourite photo spot in Paris discovered! From the view at the Trocadero, head away from the city and take your first left hand turn to find this hidden gem.  Macarons and more macarons! I’m not even ashamed to say this is a small glimpse in to the amount I consumed during my stay – I was averaging a box a day! When in Rome…  My personal favourite view is that atop the Arc de Triomphe which is still (amazingly) not that crowded every time I have visited. Be sure to visit on a clear day so you have an unspoiled view of the tower. (P.S. Robyn is pictured here with me, my Aussie friend who is living in London and came to visit for the day!)  Sunsets on the Seine (it’s the simple things).  Pastries, pastries, and more pastries! To be fair I was research marketing for my bakery, Charlie’s Dessert House. I cannot wait to recreate some of these French classics in store (and share with you on my Youtube channel!)  The Palais Royal – an instagram hotspot for bloggers that I haven’t stumbled upon ’til this trip!  I flew to Paris via Helsinki with Finnair. If you choose to fly with them, be sure to make the most of a stopover in Helsinki! Thanks to all my friends who made this trip so fun and spoiled me with their presence for a day or afternoon.

141,"If you’re wondering where to find the best gelato in Florence, look no further. As a self confessed gelato addict and personally appointed sweets enthusiast, I have been to Florence a number of times to try, taste and delight over the incredible creamy textures and rich flavours of the best gelato in Italy. Here are the top picks (in order of preference!)  Although it might seem a little far in the distance when consulting a map, La Carraia, located on the Oltranro side of the river is extremely worth the walk. Besides, the more you walk out of your way to get the gelato, the more you can indulge once there! The best idea is to pick three flavours and learn what you like, followed by a later visit for your favourite flavour(s) or just try a few more! You really can’t go wrong – this is perhaps the best gelato in the world. The prices are also a steal (presumably thanks to their location a little out of the way) with a baby cone on offer at just 1 euro. The portion servings are very generous, so be sure to arrive hungry or after a light lunch only – you’ll want to save plenty of room for these creamy creations! Location: Piazza Sauro Nazario, 25/R – Ponte alla Carraia (on the Oltrarno side) & Carraia 2 on Via dei Benci Due to its other offerings (as a pastry shop, coffee AND gelateria), Badiani comes in at second place as it offers a great light breakfast in the morning, followed by gelato in the afternoon/evenings. Without a doubt the flavour of choice to try is “Buontalenti”, which was named after the man who is said to have invented gelato itself back in the 15th Century. Location: Viale dei Mille, 20, about 4 blocks from the stadium This gelatria prides itself on using on the freshest ingredients to create its wonderfully creamy creations, making it one of the best places to go for gelato in Florence. Because of their commitment to keeping the gelato fresh, the flavours are limited and seasonally on offer. This is perhaps the best place to go for fruity flavours. Location: Via Lambertesca, 18 and Piazza Oberdan, 2r If you like your gelato rich and full of flavour in just one small spoonful, then you really can’t go past Grom. After such success in Florence they have since opened numerous stores across the world in locations like Manhattan, Paris, and Tokyo. What makes their gelato so unique is that they source only the best ingredients from all over the world, such as cocoa beans from Venezuela and Colombia (hence I would really recommend the chocolate flavour!!!) Location: Via del Campanile – corner with Via delle Oche (right side of the Duomo) If you like your flavours a little more inventive and sometimes on the whacky side, head on over to Gelateria de’Neri for a fantastic range of playful flavours with incredible tastes. The caramel is rich and creamy (a must try!), but flavours like chocolate and hot chilli with pistachio will surprise and enlighten your tastebuds. Be sure to try a few flavours to see what you fancy/could do without! Location: Via dei Neri 9/10r This list could go on and on as Florence is full of gelaterias, however you really needn’t venture beyond this list – you’ll find the creme de la creme in the above locations! And if I’m to be completely honest, I personally wouldn’t venture beyond La Carraia (#1) – it really can’t be beaten! See more of my adventures on Instagram."
142,"There is no denying Vintgar Gorge is one of the most naturally beautiful locations in Slovenia. The man-made boardwalks criss cross their way through the gorge for an impressive 1.6km and make this a photographer’s dream. This is also one of the easiest destinations in Slovenia to reach, thanks to its proximity to Lake Bled. Vintgar Gorge is just a 15 minute car drive from Lake Bled or if you’re feeling up for it, you can also cycle or walk by following the pedestrian signs. Vintgar Gorge is a 1.6km gorge located inside Triglav National Park. With its emerald green waters and natural beauty, this has become one of the most popular spots to visit in Slovenia. What makes this gorge so special is the man made boardwalks that suspend over the gorge, criss crossing their way across the flowing water. July and August are peak season in Slovenia so if you are visiting during the warmer months you can expect to share the boardwalks with many other tourists. The gorge opens at 7:00am in the summer months so if you would prefer to have this place to yourself, be sure to arrive just before opening time. If you can’t visit Vintgar Gorge in the early morning, the next best time is two hours before closing (8:00pm in the summer months). Distance:  1.6 km one-way (3.2 km round trip)
Price:  Adults 10€; Children 6-15 years 3€, parking is a hefty 5€
Location:  10-15 minutes by car from Bled
Hours of Operation:  7 am to 8 pm during the summer months; shorter hours for other seasons Because Vintgar Gorge is only 10-15 minutes by car from Bled, another great option is to walk or cycle. The parking fee is a hefty 5€ so if you’re looking to save your pennies, park near the gorge or walk/cycle from Bled. Once you arrive you can purchase a ticket at the gate and enter immediately. If you arrive at opening time, you can see the gorge in around one hour. Arriving during the day or afternoon will mean sharing the boardwalks with many other tourists, so you will need a couple of hours to see the gorge in this case. The first part of the gorge is the most impressive and best for photos. At about the half way point I turned back on myself to enjoy the boardwalks almost entirely alone, before the crowds arrived. This is one of the most popular activities near Bled so for the best experience try to arrive early and have your camera ready!"
143,"Central Europe is filled with hidden gems, but there are three standout capital cities that have stolen the limelight in recent years, linked by their past and being arguably three of Europe’s most photogenic cities to see in the flesh. Thus a visit to Central Europe would be incomplete without visit Prague’s Czech bohemian architecture, Vienna’s Imperial Palaces and Budapest’s famous hot thermal springs. Equally so, an entire itinerary in Central Europe could focus completely on these three gems with a recommended 3 nights staying in each. So if you’re thinking of visiting Prague, Vienna and Budapest, here is an entire itinerary to help you plan your stay in three of Europe’s most magical cities.  The Czech capital has a way of capturing the hearts of each and every person to enter the city, even if you’re just visiting Prague for a few days. With impossibly charming alleyways, the Vltava River running through the city and an eery castle atop a hill that overlooks the city, there really is so much to keep you busy in Prague for your first visit. I happened to love the city so much that I have since returned thrice, and I still feel as if there is more to explore amidst the terracotta rooftops. Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for Franz kafka references throughout the city, as well as visiting the statue of Prague’s most celebrated literary artist. One of Prague’s little known hidden gems is a haven of rare and beautiful books, located inside the library at Strahov Monastery. Charles Bridge, which is lined with 16 arches and 30 baroque statues, is best seen at dawn before the sun rises and the crowds begin marching their way to Prague’s most talked about point of interest. Although a little walk out of the way, the extra effort is worth it to walk up the Vltava River to Ginger & Fred’s “Dancing House” as it has come to be known – a modern architectural beauty unique to Prague. If you’re looking to splurge on a romantic weekend in Prague, the Four Seasons Prague has one of the best room views in the entire city, and the Mandarin Oriental Prague have some great dining options for a special evening out. Further reading: Prague Bucket List // Prague for First Timers  Imperial and impressive, Vienna is one of the grandest cities in all of Europe. The kaffeehaus culture mixed with the ornate architecture transports you back to a time that time itself forgot, and you can’t help but to imagine up a story or two from previous lives. If you see just one work of art during your time in Vienna, head on over to the Belvedere to see Gustav Klimt’s The Kiss – an incredible work of symbolist art, fashioned using gold leaf. Make sure you cafe hop around Vienna’s famous kaffeehaus‘, though if you’re just looking for one to try, head to Cafe Landtmann and try the apple strudel. For the best schnitzel, head to Figlmuller. The best restaurant in Vienna is actually located 25 kilometres outside of the city itself, but should this not deter you be sure to check out Marchfelderhof restaurant –a destination in itself. Sachertorte, a beautifully rich cake created in 1832 is a staple dish to try in the Austrian capital. If you’re wondering where to find the best variation, its a toss up between Hotel Sacher and Demel. In the interest of market research, I suggest trying both. Further reading: A Quick Guide to Vienna // Vienna Bucket List  Glittering at dusk as the city illuminates, Budapest is a city that looks glamorous on the surface… but dig a little deeper and you will uncover a turbulent past. Now with influence from the Turkish Ottoman Empire and Austrian Habsburg Empire, Budapest is one of Europe’s most unique cities to visit with many thermal baths, imperial architecture, and a very vibrant youthful scene in the summer time. There are oodles of places to visit in Budapest to keep you busy for three or four days, however these insider tips will ensure you don’t miss anything important! The Fisherman’s Bastion towers illuminate at dusk and offer the best views over the city. If you plan to do any souvenir shopping, look out for the painted wooden Hungarian dolls in traditional dress. Although not as highly talked about as other attractions, one step inside The Great Synagogue on Dohany Street will leave you in complete awe.

144,"As the gateway to the adventurous terrains of Iceland, Reykjavik has become a hot spot for travellers either passing through to begin their journey of the island nation, or stopping for a few days between Europe and North America. After spending a few days here myself earlier in the year, I realised that the beauty of Iceland’s capital lies slightly beneath the surface – in the small boutiques, cafes, the quirky book stores and the people that occupy them. So if you’re looking to make the most of your time in in the city, here’s a quick guide to Reykjavik that will have you feeling like a local in no time!  The drive between the airport and the city takes approximately 45 minutes and is sign posted the entire way, taking you all the way to the town centre. The route can only be made on four wheels (there are no trains), and if you’re heading elsewhere in Iceland or planning on some day trips, I highly recommend hiring a car for your time in the country. Alternatively, if you’re only in town for a few days and plan to walk around the city (which is very easy and condensed), there is a low cost bus for ten euros, which will take you to the centre of Reykjavik. Once downtown, there are a number of options for accommodation and to my surprise, it wasn’t as crazy expensive as I had been told and read everywhere (it wasn’t cheap either, but by Australian standards it was not dissimilar to Melbourne or Sydney!) One of the better options nowadays is to book an apartment or cabin through Air BnB, with some lovely listings giving you an insight into Icelandic lifestyle and living. If you leave it a little late (ahem, over here!) there are plenty of hotels downtown and around the rim of the city it becomes a little cheaper. I checked in to Radisson Blu on the fringe of the city where the room rates were very affordable and included breakfast. Having a vehicle, it was also much easier to find a hotel with ample (and free) parking!  Now that you’re downtown, get ready to pack your days with plenty of pit stops, not only because there are some great boutiques and concept stores to discover… but it also helps with the cold! KRAUM – A lovely little gift store with local artisan’s work. This is the perfect place to find a new beanie or scarf to keep you warm for the rest of your Icelandic adventure! 12 Tonar – Independent record label and store with a rock and roll focus. Its everything you thought the Icelandic music scene would be! Aftur – Clothing store using recycled fabrics. Iceland is a very “green” country and everyone you meet is environmentally focused and forward thinking. Litla Jólabúðin – The “Little Christmas Shop” is a year-round Christmas shop with so many cute trinkets to take home that if you’re anything like me, you’ll need a new suitcase to take them all home!  Conscious living is a huge theme here in Iceland, so eating healthily and plant based is easier now more than ever… so much so that even my non-vegan friend was rushing to these eateries by the end of our stay! Glo – My favourite vegan eatery in Reykjavik was so good that we ended up planning our adventures around meal times, just to eat here twice a day! They are most known for their healthy bowls, but the “pulled pork” (jackfruit) burger was my absolute favourite! Kaffi Vinyl – If you’re looking for a work space to spend a few hours in, then you can’t go wrong at this happening little vegan cafe! Cafe Babalu – Make a drool-worthy vegan carrot cake and a few other veggie options on the menu! Nostra – More on the swanky side is Nostra if you’re looking for a dinner date night to impress. They’ve got a great range of vegan and veggie friendly options.  Sandholt – Great little cafe and one of the most popular in town. There are so many cakes to choose from that you’ll be planning your next visit before you have left! The cinnamon bun (pictured above) is a house staple and the perfect combo with a coffee in the afternoon. Kaffitar – For one of the best barista coffees in town, look no further. Stofan Cafe – If you’re just as much about the vibe as you are the coffee, then head over to Stofan Cafe. This is a cute little cafe with mix-n-match tables and chairs and the hot chocolate is a perfect pick me up after braving the cold streets of Reyk!  Hallgrímskirkja church is undeniably the best 360 view of Reykjavik from above. A visit to the top of the church will cost you 1000 ISK, but is well worth it to see the colourful rooftops of the capital city from above. There is a free car park on site at the church and this is a great place to leave your car while you venture off on foot to explore the city.  Of course a trip to Reykjavik would not be complete without visiting one of Iceland’s most popular destinations (and certainly one of the most photographed): The Blue Lagoon! Located approximately 40 minutes drive out of town, this thermal spa has become a destination in itself for visitors to Iceland. It is important to note that with popularity comes a few consequences: namely that this place is packed and expensive to visit (especially when comparing to the Secret Lagoon which is free of charge, natural, and loved by locals!) Regardless, this is a must-visit on any traveller’s visit to Reykjavik.  Read more: How to Spend Four Days in Iceland"
145,"There’s something so magical about the city of Amsterdam: the tree-lined canals, intricate Dutch canal houses and an endless supply of cyclists buzzing by on their daily commute. As a walkable city, Amsterdam is great to explore solo as it is effortless to make your way around the streets. There are many small art galleries to enjoy and there is an endless supply of cute cafes to pass the time people watching. If you plan on visiting Amsterdam solo, check out this complete guide to enjoy solo travel in Amsterdam!  The prettiest (and most photographed) canals of Amsterdam exist in Centrum, the heart and centre of Amsterdam. This also happens to be the most expensive part of town to lodge, so if you’re a solo traveller on a budget it can pay to stay in the suburbs and either bike your way to the city to explore, catch public transport, or if you aren’t visiting in winter, make a walk out of it. The three main canals (Herengracht, Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht) were dug in the 17th century during the Dutch Golden Age and commenced the Dutch capitals’ system of waterways. Now popularly known as the “Venice of the North”, Amsterdam is considered one of the prettiest European capitals and is thus a pleasure to walk around solo, especially if you don’t mind putting away your maps and getting lost in the exploration. Now a UNESCO World Heritage listed site, the neighbourhood of Jordaan is so quintessentially Dutch that the history and aesthetic of the neighbourhood has been protected and believe me when I say it is as pretty as a postcard to wander around! Of course “coffee shops” (cannabis stores) have their own place in Amsterdam, however if you’re after actual coffee and perhaps a slice o’ cake, these are some great spots to stop by: Moods Coffee Corner – The perfect afternoon pick-me-up, try the apple cake for a show stopper. Winkel 43 – Great lattes and one of the best avocado toasts in the neighbourhood if not the city! Cafe De Blaffende Vis – For a more traditionally Dutch coffee spot, this is your best shot.   The Netherlands are renowned the world over for their beautiful tulips and if you just so happen to time your visit at the right season, you can see many of the flowers in full bloom at the cities’ flower market. Bloemenmarkt in fact floats over water and is the only one to do so in the world, located on Singel Canal between Muntplein and Koningsplein. Last but not least, there are at least two if not three days of museums to see and explore in Amsterdam! For my time in the city I purchased a City Pass to gain access to all of the museums as well as an additional pass to the Anne Frank House as this is not included in any of the discount passes. There are endless museums and art galleries on offer in the city (as well as Amsterdam being a living museum itself), however here are the highlights not to be missed: Anne Franke House – Inside the secret house where Anne Frank spent her journalling years during the Nazi Germany takeover of much of Europe and indeed, Amsterdam. This is not to be missed and if you choose just one museum, let it be this one. Rijksmuseum – The National Dutch museum dedicated to the art and history of the country. Van Gogh museum – A museum dedicated to the works of Vincent Van Gogh and his contemporaries.  Over to you! What are some of your favourite memories from travelling solo in Amsterdam?

146," Tucked neatly away in South Bohemia, a visit to Cesky Krumlov will leave you feeling as if you have walked in to a former time period. Complete with bohemian architecture, food, and a noticeably relaxed way of life. The entire town is UNESCO World Heritage-listed, with international food chains banned from opening up in the town that appears determined to hold true to its roots (which just makes this town even more loveable!) With around 2 million visitors per year, this small town in Czech Republic is certainly no secret, nor is it a surprise that the locals are overwhelmed with a love-hate relationship through the summer months when most visitors arrive in town. For this reason, we’d suggest a shoulder season visit if possible or better yet, a visit during winter to enjoy the town almost entirely to yourself. An even better way to maximize your visit and see the town at its best is to stay a night or two, as most visitors are passing through during the day and heading onwards to Prague in the North or South to Salzburg, Vienna and other destinations in Austria.  Cesky Krumlov Castle – Castles and Europe go hand in hand, so it comes at no surprise to any of us that even a town as small as Cesky Krumlov has an oversized castle to explore. During the warmer months, there is even a resident bear outside the castle. Castle Tower – After visiting the resident bear, make your way to the top of the tower for one of the best views over the city. Castle Theatre – You’ve never seen a theatre quite like this before. In traditional Baroque style, this is considered to be one of the most beautiful in the world. The theatre is open only to private tours for preservation, so be sure to book in advance or make it your first point of call to do so when you arrive in the town. Castle Gardens – If you’re a green thumb like me, then don’t miss out on the castle gardens in the summertime. Cathedral of St. Vitus – Even if you’re just admiring it from afar, be sure to take mental note of the cathedral of St. Vitus as it takes an iconic place in the skyline. Vltava River – Another popular thing to do in the warmer months is to float down the Vltava River on a raft, floatie, or just float your body downstream!  Laibon – The original vegan eatery in Krumlov, Laibon has been around for as long as I can remember and I won’t make a trip to Krumlov without stopping by. The soups have been a lifesaver in the wintertime and the setting on the river is too good to pass up! Nirvana – Another favourite in wintertime is to warm up with a healthy but hearty Indian curry at Nirvana. They have plenty of veggie options and will cater to vegans also. Dobra Cajovna – Another vegan favourite with a very earthy vibe. Cafe Strudel – The town’s go-to dessert shop. MLS Creperie – As the name suggests – a creperie and pancake shop. BON BON – Chocolate shop.  One of the biggest draw cards for visitors to Cesky Krumlov is the incredible postcard-worthy view they’ve seen umpteenth times before. Here’s where you’ll snap the best vies of the town: Castle Cafe and Hotel Ruze.  Follow along on Instagram for more adventures!"
147,"The Glacier Express is Switzerland’s crowning jewel of rail travel. Travelling by train is without a doubt the best way to see the Swiss countryside and for anyone who has partaken in some or all of the Glacier Express journey, you will know what I mean when I say it is a once in a lifetime experience. But is it all it is cracked up to be? I recently travelled on the Glacier Express for the full journey from Zermatt to St Moritz to see whether it is truly as impressive as it looks at first glance. The journey, as magical as it was, did have a few flaws and for the purpose of review you will find a full overview in this feature on the famous Glacier Express!  Although classified as an express train, the Glacier Express runs in full length from Zermatt to St Moritz (and vice versa) in around 8 hours. Thus it has been self-dubbed the world’s “slowest express train”. Much of the journey travels through the Swiss Alps, as well as a portion of the journey running through the UNESCO World Heritage recognised Bernina landscapes. The full journey passes over 291 bridges and through 91 tunnels, with the most impressive points of the journey being over the Landwasser viaduct, through the Rhine Gorge and the many countryside towns seen through the Bernina landscapes.  As we were travelling with a Eurail Global Pass in first class, we opted to take the journey in first class but were surprised by what little difference there is between the two classes. The main difference between the two classes was space, though first class wasn’t much different to second and with the same table service + menu, I would recommend taking the journey in both classes – depending on your preference. What I did notice later in the journey was that the windows in second class were able to be opened, whereas the windows in first class are fixed and result in a strong glare in all of your photos (ugh!) Thus if you are travelling on the Glacier Express for the purpose of taking nice photos of the scenery, I would suggest travelling in second class as a better option.  We started our journey in Switzerland’s most famous ski resort town; Zermatt. This is the beginning or end of the journey (depending in which direction you travel) and is the perfect winter playground to spend a few days to a week in the snow, enjoying the range of activities on offer. Read more: A Guide to Zermatt.  The Glacier Express takes the following route through the Swiss countryside: Zermatt – Visp – Brig – Andermatt – Disentis – Chur – St Moritz (or Davos). Each stop allows enough time to get some fresh air outside of the train, with a longer stop (30 minutes) in Disentis, allowing enough time to disembark and stretch the legs or purchase some snacks at a fraction of the price you will pay on board.  With around 8 hours on board there is more than enough time to experience the Swiss countryside from the comfort of your window. Not only does the Glacier Express stop in a number of Swiss towns, but also passes effortlessly by a number of smaller villages and regions. From Zermatt, the train descends through the Mattertal line, passing through a handful of small towns such as Täsch, Randa, St. Niklaus, Stalden, and larger towns like Visp and Brig. From here the train passes through the Furka section, into a winter wonderland as you pass through Andermatt, another popular ski destination. Onwards to Chur, the train then passes through the impressive Rhine Gorge – home to huge rock faces and a turquoise river that is very popular for locals to enjoy water activities such as kayaking and canoeing. From Chur the train heads onwards through the Albula line and passes some of the most impressive scenery of the entire journey. This is where you will see the famous Landwasser viaduct (a great photo opportunity) and a number of castles in the mountains and valleys. This feature/review wouldn’t be balanced without mention of some of the downsides to the Glacier Express, or at least to paint a realistic picture of what to expect beyond the amazing scenery. The service on board was very attentive and polite, though the menu itself was a bit of a let down. As the train journey includes table service I was excited to spend an hour or more of the journey indulging in local cuisine to help pass the time. I read a few reviews prior to our journey, all of which didn’t look too favourably on the food, so upon seeing the prices of the food on board we decided to give it a miss. There were a few vegetarian options which was great to see, however it was hard to justify spending around $60 on lunch with an additional $9 for a soft drink or small bottle of water.  The journey ends (or begins for travellers heading in the opposite direction) in St Moritz, infamously known as the winter playground for the International Elite (translation: its expensive). Popular in both winter and summer, there isn’t a great deal to do in St Moritz outside of these seasons and as we came to learn, it becomes quite a ghost town outside of these times. Regardless it was a nice pit stop for a couple of nights after such a long travel day and we used this time to refresh before the onward journey to the Italian lakes district! Thanks to My Switzerland for arranging my visit to Switzerland and journey on the Glacier Express railway."
148,"If you’re looking for the best cafes in Brno then look no further than SKØG. An interior designers dream, SKOG’s open plan with charmingly squeaky floorboards is a haven for Brno’s hipsters. Friendly staff, plenty of seating, amazing coffee and delicious food (think pancakes, burgers, salads, soup and homemade bread).

Address: 16, Orlí 491, 602 00 Brno-město, Czechia Punkt has a little more of a dark and grungy vibe than the others.

149,"As a political science major at University, a trip to The Hague has been on my to-go list for quite some time. Yet standing there in the centre of it all, it was still surreal to me to be standing where the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court reside. I had just one night in The Hague for my book signing tour in the Netherlands, so I was determined to hit the ground running and see as much as I could within 24 hours. So with that, here’s what to see and do in The Hague in 24 hours! I told many Dutchies I encountered of my plans to visit The Hague but every single one of them looked at me in confusion. “Den Haag” is how to say it in Dutch, so I would suggest you use this term as it warranted a much better reaction! Although not the capital of The Netherlands (a title that belongs to Amsterdam), The Hague is indeed the seat of the Dutch parliament and as previously mentioned, the judicial capital of the world. With such a strong international identity, I wasn’t surprised to see this spill out into all aspects of life in The Hague – not least the fantastic little Italian restaurant I found near to my hotel! With stunning stately architecture and cute little cafes/boutiques to discover, I had my work cut out to see in the city in such a short space of time. For my one night stay, I checked in to the ultra-luxe bucket list hotel, Hotel Des Indes. As part of the Leading Hotels of the World, this hotel has a strong clientele of men in suits and ladies dressed without wrinkles (in their clothes – an unattainable luxury for someone living out of a suitcase). The hotel is in a great location for exploring, especially if you’re anything like me and plan to find all the great eats around town. A short walk away you will stumble upon Frederikstraat, home to many cute cafes, restaurants and tiny boutiques as you continue to wander along. The Hague is deceptively large and there’s much to see, so be ready to hit the ground running! Binnenhof – Surrounded by moats, Binnenhof was once a castle and now the seat of Dutch parliament. It is probably the most impressive building in all of The Hague, centrally located and with great restaurants nearby. Plein – The most elegant square in the city centre and a great central point to begin your explorations. Peace Palace – Home of the International Court of Justice. Paleis Noordeinde – The royal palace, used as the office of King Willem-Alexander since he became king in 2013. How I managed to fit so much in to my two half days in The Hague one will never know, but believe me when I say I found some great eateries! De Bakkerswinkel – Got a huge portion of yoghurt + granola here for breakfast one morning. They also have a house cat! FOAM – This is a great little vegan find on Frederikstraat. They do superb smoothies! Barista Cafe – Probably the best coffee in town (even if its the only one I tried). But yeah, it was good! Delicious Sweetness – Cute little patisserie I picked up a couple of macarons from. The macarons were nice enough, but I knew I could find better! Patisserie Jarreau – Hands down the best macarons in The Hague – unsurprisingly by a French pastry chef! If you have more time or are planning a larger trip of the Netherlands, I would highly recommend taking a day trip to Delft (the cutest little town to ever exist) and Leiden (ten minutes by train and another pretty city in the Netherlands). "
150,"As one of my favourite underrated countries I have explored in Europe, I adore Bosnia and Herzegovina. In fact, I’ve got a long list of reasons as to why you’ll love this country in the Balkans! The culture is of course one of the best reasons to visit, but there is also some beautiful scenery. Often travellers overlook this hidden gem. If you’re more of a slow traveller then pack your bags and give yourself some time. These are the 12 best places in Bosnia and Herzegovina to explore. Although I had never heard of it before arriving to the country, Počitelj quickly became one of my favourite villages to visit with thanks to a local guy who offered to show us the hillside village on a cloudy afternoon drive out of Mostar. Located on the left bank of the river Neretva, Počitelj has incredible views overlooking the village and river below if you’re willing to hike the stairs to the top. A small town outside of Mostar, Blagaj is often overlooked by travellers visiting the nearby famous old bridge. Blagaj is where I stayed for a week to explore Bosnia & Herzegovina and the family who kindly hosted me were all too eager to show me around the country around their work schedules. But it was here in Blagaj that I really took the time to unwind and switch off from the online world – deep in the Southeast of the country. Pictured is the Dervish Monastery Blagaj Tekija, a 600 year old monastery at the base of a cliff. Chances are you have already seen or heard of Mostar’s famous old bridge as it has built quite a reputation for itself as the major attraction in Bosnia & Herzegovina, thanks in part to its’ proximity to neighbouring Dubrovnik (Croatia) and accessibility as a day trip. The old bridge (Stari Most) was rebuilt after the 1990s conflict after standing for 427 years and has become famous for its diving competition every summer at the end of July. A compact city with a lot to cover in a short geographic space, Sarajevo feels like a world away from reality with its’ cobblestone streets, misty hookah lounges and laidback attitude. There’s also a lot of history to uncover in the capital of Bosnia & Herzegovina, so despite its’ small size, be sure to allow for a few days to discover this city on foot. Located in the heartland of Bosnia & Herzegovina, Kravica waterfall is a local’s favourite as well as for those visiting from abroad (especially in the summer months to escape the heat and pop in for a dip!) As the second largest city in the country, Banja Luka is another great pit stop for those city folk who need a plethora of restaurants, bars and pubs to choose from. This city is the centre of the Bosanska Krajina region and is located in the northwestern part of the country. With only 20km of coastline, Neum is the only town from Bosnia & Herzegovina to be situated on the peninsula with access to the Adriatic Sea (read about the history of such in this intriguing article). This makes Neum a popular spot for holidaymakers, though with its close proximity to Croatia’s coastline, is often overlooked by travellers to Bosnia & Herzegovina. Another small town that must be visited is Jajce, with its impressive Pliva waterfall being a highlight for travellers passing through. If you find yourself in central Bosnia be sure to stop in Travnik, an idyllic town with an interesting history given it was the capital city of governors from 1699 to 1850. As the oldest National park in Bosnia, Sutjeska National Park is a must visit for active travellers who prefer to get outdoors and work for their viewpoints. The park includes the highest peak of Maglić at over 2,386 metres, on the border with Montenegro. If adventure travel is more your style, the second park you cannot miss is Blidinje, located in the heart of the Dinaric Alps. Hiking and climbing is in abundance and with the country remaining such a hidden gem of Europe, you’ll often feel as though you have the entire park to yourself. The final destination we’d recommend as a must visit in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small town in the north known as Konjic. This historic importance of this town makes it a necessary pit stop in your travels. During the Bosnian War the Konjic region served as an important link between Sarajevo and Southern Bosnia & Herzegovina. Aside from history, the town sits amongst some of the most beautiful scenery you will find in the country."
151,"  The Southern Coast of Portugal is one of the countries’ most celebrated gems, with many locals and international visitors alike making the trip down South to explore the dramatic cliffs, sun-drenched beaches and tasty Portuguese seaside cuisine. The best way to see the south of Portugal is undoubtedly to hire a car and cruise the coast, making sure to allow plenty of time to stop in small towns and vineyards along the way. Here’s your complete guide to road tripping the South Coast of Portugal!  Most travellers arriving to Portugal will arrive in the countries’ capital, Lisbon, and believe me when I say it is a city worth spending some time! Lisbon is bursting at the seams with a vibrancy of life that is impossible to find in any other European capital – everywhere you look is a maze of colour, with wafts of fresh pastries filling the morning air. Your journey to the Southern Coast of Portugal should thus commence with a few days in Lisbon to take in all the capital of Portugal has to offer. Be sure not to miss a short expedition to Belém to enjoy the famous Pastéis de Belém custard tarts (believe me when I say this is a once in a lifetime experience not to be missed) and if you have more time, a day trip to Sintra and Cascais.  Whilst in Lisbon be sure to tick these must do experiences off your visitor list: Alfama Neighbourhood – The heart of Lisbon is in one of its oldest neighbourhoods; the picturesque Alfama. Characterised by its hills, winding cobblestone pathways and colourful homes, Alfama is worthy of a half day just to wander around, pop in to the odd cafe or local restaurant and continue on your journey. Here is where you will also find some of the best views of the city. Lisbon Castle – Speaking of great views, the best is to be had at the Lisbon Castle, with unobstructed views over the entire city. Tram 28 – Lisbon’s famous Tram 28 is a great way to see the Alfama neighbourhood without the work out, though if you’re anything like me you’ll need to burn a few calories to make room for all those pastries! National Tile Museum – One of my favourite features of Lisbon’s architecture is the intricacies in the tiling, so forgive me for the geeky mention but the National Tile Museum is a great place to see and understand the history behind the national art form. Belém – A short drive away from the city will see you arrive in Belém, home to the famous pasteis de nata, a warm custard tart surrounded in a case of flaky pastry. Delicious in an understatement. Sintra & Cascais – If you have an extra day in Lisbon be sure to make your way to Sintra and Cascais, two nearby small towns with a lot of charm and appeal. The castle overlooking Sintra is a must visit.  After a few days in Lisbon it is time to hire a car, hit the road and make tracks to the Algarve: Portugal’s beloved southern coast. The journey will take around 2.5 hours in total without stops. Once you arrive, the most logical base is to stay in Faro, the capital city of the Algarve with a lot of history, a great food scene and plenty of history and culture to uncover. The medieval cobblestone streets of the old town will have you feeling as if you have stepped back in time and with Roman and Moorish architectural influences at every turn, there are endless details to discover.  If you’re looking for a more relaxed seaside vacation, there is one property on the southern coast of Portugal that can’t be beat: Vila Vita Parc. This popular resort is an annual vacation for many, with an offering of both resort-style accommodation and private villas that can be rented (with private pools and beach access, no less!) Myself and my three girlfriends checked in to one of VVP’s four bedroom villas for a few nights, which came complete with a private butler, golf-buggy transfers around the resort and pastel coloured sunrises and sunsets to really top it all off. "
152,"Throughout my two weeks in Montenegro I became quite familiar with the southwest coast. After spending a week in Porto Montenegro and another week in Perast and Kotor, I made my way down to Lustica Bay and checked in to the Chedi Hotel. Lustica Bay is a new development and an exciting one at that. Montenegro’s coastline continues to boom with new real estate and the government are being careful to maintain Montenegro’s heritage by putting building stipulations in place that require new buildings to essentially look old. The Chedi Hotel is brand new and there are only a handful of shops open at Lustica Bay right now, though this is rapidly changing coming in to the summer season and beyond. This resort is tucked neatly away in the quietness of the bay and yet is only a 20 minute drive from the Tivat airport, with direct connections to London. The hotel is home to both an indoor and outdoor infinity swimming pool, giving it more of a resort feel and attracting more families than solo or business travellers. If you’re travelling with kids the hotel is very well catered for families and feels as if you could be anywhere in the world with its’ resort feeling. Many of the rooms are apartment style with cooking facilities so be sure to plan in advance as there is only one small supermarket in Lustica Bay with an early closing time. Alternatively, “The Spot” restaurant at the hotel have a huge menu and great vegetarian options, so I found myself eating there every evening. The spa at The Chedi is probably the best day spa in the entire region and the hotel gym is one of the best I’ve been to in a long while. Located next to the gym is a large indoor swimming pool, so I often found this to be a place to unwind with very few guests around. To book a room at The Chedi, visit their website. Room rates start around €260 per room per night. There are 111 rooms on site and 60 of these are condominiums, making this the perfect choice for families and groups."
153,"Moscow is a beautiful city which is bound to thrill. With its fascinating history, iconic sights and enviable shopping scene, you’ll never run out of things to do. For those seeking an exciting break in a city that never sleeps, look no further than Moscow. This extensive guide features the best places to eat, play and stay in Moscow! The White Rabbit features as number 18 on the list of The World’s 50 Best Restaurants.

Inspired by Alice in Wonderland, with playing cards on the tables, a human-sized pepper grinder used to garnish your food and rabbits decorating the interior. Just like the rabbit hole, once you descend into the magical world of the White Rabbit you won’t ever want to return to normality. Smolenskiy Passazh, Smolenskaya Square, 3, Moscow, Russia  This is Moscow at its most extravagant. Spread over 14 rooms, it includes homages to Louis XVI, the Ming Dynasty and imperial Russia, the interior of this ornate restaurant would look more fitting as an extension of the Louvre. Inside the Chinese and Japanese menu of Dim Sum and sashimi surprise and please diners. Tverskoy bul’var 26/5, Moscow Vogue café is perfectly situated in the heart of Moscow’s shopping area attracting a string of fashionable Muscovites who come to lunch and socialize in between shopping. The menu is expansive serving everything from light salads to delicious cakes. ul. Kuznetskiy Most, 7/9, Moscow, Russia Bridge Brasserie is one of the trendiest places to grab a coffee in Moscow. Whether you choose to sip your coffee on the sunny terrace or in the elaborate interior you won’t be disappointed. In the daytime it functions as a café but come the evening the basement turns into a chic bar and nightclub, attracting Moscow’s most fashionable crowd. ul. Kuznetskiy Most, 6/3, Moscow, Russia Cafe Pushkin is a favourite among locals who return time after time for the menu of Russian classics served by suited waiters. Named after the famous Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, this book-lined café has become somewhat of an institute in Moscow. Tverskoy Blvd, 26А, Moscow, Russia, 125009  A couple of minutes away from the prestigious Bolshoi theatre you’ll find this wonderful restaurant. Everything on the menu is delicious, but the desserts in particular are things of beauty. If you need a pitstop among sightseeing in the area, this restaurant comes highly recommended. ul. Petrovka, 3/6, стр. 2, Moscow, Russia  If rooftop bars are your thing, then this one should be at the top of your Moscow list. The chic outdoor terrace has terrific views over the Bolshoi and Red Square and has become the trendiest spot in town for fashionable Muscovites who come early to ensure a seat and stay well into the night. 4 Neglinnaya Ulitsa, Moscow, Russia This is the place to come for the most quintessential Russian experience with a menu of over 400 different types of vodka and unbeatable views over the Kremlin. The rooftop terrace at the Ritz is spans the whole of the top floor and features a vast outdoor area, a glass-domed interior and Moet & Chandon sun loungers. Tverskaya Street 3, Moscow 125009 Russia Strelka is Moscow’s hippest bar with a terrace overlooking the Moscvo river, an incredible drinks menu with lots of trendy concoctions and live DJs at the nightclub below. This is where the young and trendy locals come to party. Bersenevskaya nab., 14, к. 5, Moscow, Russia  This was once a chocolate factory creating Red October chocolates for chocolate lovers in Moscow, now it’s an art space with multiple bars, clubs, coffee shops and exhibition spaces all within the grounds of the former chocolate factory. Extremely popular with young hipsters, this place comes to life on evenings and weekends.  The Moskva River runs all the way through central Moscow and is a beautiful place to stroll in the city. Walking along the river banks you’ll pass the Kremlin, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour as well as a couple of beautiful bridges. The views from the river are sure to delight especially under the amber sunset glow.  Contrary to what people might think, Moscow is a very green city with tree-lined avenues and big parks. Many of the gardens are centrally located such as Alexandrovsky Park and Gorky Park. Others are further out but still worth the trek, especially the Arkhangelskoe State Museum-Estate, which houses formal gardens and a grand estate.  Many of the rooms at the Baltschug Kempinski have breathtaking views over St Basil’s cathedral and Red Square, which are only a stone’s throw away from the hotel. Baltschug Kempinski is an elegant hotel with beautiful interiors and flawless service. The best thing about it? You can enjoy a romantic dinner on the summer terrace whilst the sun sets over St Basil’s cathedral in the not so far distance.  The Ararat Park Hyatt is a slick and modern hotel in the center of Moscow. It is a mere few minutes from the Bolshoi and the most prestigious shopping areas GUM & TSUM. Inspired by the Armenian restaurant that once stood in its place, it features an Armenian fine dining, as well as a Japanese restaurant. The rooftop terrace is famous throughout the city for its killer views and cocktail menu."
154,"When I think of romantic locations around the world to explore, my mind immediately wanders to Europe. The likes of Paris, Rome and Venice are incredibly romantic city explorations, however, some of the best destinations to explore with your other half are tucked away in the countryside, offering nothing but relaxation, great food, great wine, and of course, great company! So if you’re looking for the most romantic regions in Europe, we’re here to share them with you! Tuscany is a region in Italy that is just bursting with great food, wine, history and art. Out in the countryside, you will find many great vineyards to visit, explore, and taste your way around… whilst cities like Florence are sure to keep the romance alive with the beautiful bridges, terracotta rooftops, and amazing gelato! The landscape of Tuscany is as pretty as a picture, with rolling hills, lush greenery, and charming little villas available to rent should you really wish to go off the grid.  If you’v ever pictured yourself in a purple coloured dream, then make your way to the region of Provence in France during the summer time when the area comes to life in purple lavender and other purple coloured blooms. Located in southeastern France, this area is also home to many great vineyards to explore, with bicycle being a great way to travel between a handful in one day. The area is bursting with charming little villages to check yourself in to, such as Gordes, Vaison la Romaine, Les Beaux de Provence and Uzès.  Stretched across Northern Italy is the incredibly romantic, incredibly photogenic Lakes District. This is a great area to explore for a spot of romance, especially given there is so much diversity within the region. Lakes in the north are characterised by high mountain ranges, whilst the southern lakes are flat and expansive. You can choose to visit the Lakes District in Italy year round, as the weather conditions remain mild throughout the year and the scenery is stunning, changing slightly with the seasons. Lake Maggiore is the longest of the lakes, stretching an incredible 65 km in length. The most well known is Lake Como, offering impressive villas to stay in with glorious gardens to explore.  Colourful cliffside houses and impressive spring blooms are what set my heart on travelling to the Amalfi Coast in the lead up to summer and I can’t even begin to put into words how magical and impossible romantic this part of the world is! The Amalfi Coast starts at Naples, continuing onwards to Sorrento, Positano, Amalfi, and neighbouring islands Capri, Ischia and Procida. The best reasons to explore this particular pocket of Italy are food (Naples is the birthplace of Pizza), views, incredible beaches and great short day hikes to walk along the coastline.  Lying to the East of Paris is Champagne country, the area of France that is devoted to producing impeccable French champagne and thus offering great opportunities to sample some of the finest! The area is filled with both small and large champagne producers, with arguably the most well-known being Moet (pronounced MO-ett, by the way!) A great way to see this part of France and much of France, in general, is to travel by vehicle, though you will soon find that car rental in France is quite expensive in comparison to neighbouring countries. Should car hire be out of your budget, there are a day tours on offer from Paris or you could purchase rail tickets for another kind of adventure (trains in France are incredibly clean, safe and reliable!)  There are three standout locations for me when visiting Austria and those are Salzburg, Hallstatt and Vienna. But before I go any further, I have also heard wonderful things about Innsbruck but so far myself have not been, so if you’re looking for a fourth location in Austria this comes highly recommended from anyone and everyone I speak to! Austria is an incredibly romantic country to visit, with the Imperial and striking architecture of Vienna, followed by a long walk through art history and a dabble in kaffehaus culture. Onwards to Salzburg, you really could not find a city in the world so incredibly picturesque, as well as filled with music history at every town (this is after all the birthplace of Mozart). If you’re looking to get more off the grid and enjoy small town life, you really cannot go wrong with a visit to Hallstatt, which is according to me the most romantic lakeside village in the whole world!  Idyllic islands and impeccable beaches – how could you go wrong with a trip to the Greek islands!? With scorching summer sun and oodles of saltwater to dip in to, there’s little wonder as to why this is one of Europe’s most popular destinations, especially for couples on vacation and honeymooners. Popular spots include Corfu, Crete, Santorini and Mykonos, with lesser-known but equally beautiful spots such as Rhodes, Skiathos, Hydra, Patmos, Naxos and Paros. The options are endless!  Located on the coastline of Portugal are some of the most charming cities, towns, and incredibly romantic beaches in the South. Your first point of call should be Lisbon, Portugal’s charming capital with endless streams of colour, charm, and friendly locals. From there you cannot miss a short day trip north to Sintra and Cascais, followed by a trip south to Portugal’s most loved holiday destination: The Algarve.  France is indeed so romantic that it deserves two places on this listing, as each pocket of France continues to offer something different to couples on their Europe explorations. The French Riviera is one such pocket that couples flock to for the summer sun and endless romance. You can expect pebble beaches, expensive real estate, and recognisable locations like St Tropez – fancy!  Last but not least, the incredibly underrated but highly romantic region of Flanders in Northern Belgium. I first visited this area solo some five years and have since returned a couple of times, again solo, but am still just as in love with this area as I was the first time. Highlights include the impossibly charming town of Brugge, nearby Ghent, Antwerp, and of course a brief stop in Brussels. Follow along on Instagram for more travel inspiration!"
155,"A visit to the Danish capital can be one of two things: a short stay to see what all the fuss is about or a short (informed) stay to see and do as much as you can in Copenhagen before you escape the sky high prices and head back inland in Europe. If you’re not on a budget you couldn’t really spend too much time in this charming city, though if you only have a few days here is everything you should see and do in that time!  You know those colourful houses along the waterfront that have (probably) convinced you that you simply must visit Copenhagen!? That would be Nyhavn. Come along in the day to see it in a calm setting but be sure to return in the late afternoon to watch the sun set and cozy up with a blanket and hot cocoa for the evening. This really needs no explanation. One of the things that really made my trip to Copenhagen so special (okay, THE thing) was making friends with a Dane who showed me around for a few days. This made my visit so much more enjoyable, authentic and memorable! If you’re up for something a little different then you will certainly find that and more in Freetown Christiania. Although the Danes can appear a little uptight and strict, you’ll see the other side of the spectrum here in self-governed Christiania. This amusement park is unlike any other – oh, and it is located right in the centre of town! The gardens are gorgeous and the rides make it more than worth your while. For a day of fun, look nowhere else.  Pictured above, the Rosenberg Castle gardens offer a different experience throughout the seasons. It is quite centrally located and full of little pockets to bury yourself in a book. If you’re looking for something a little more localised, head to this market for gourmet delicacies and casual eats. Because what could seem more charming than rowing a boat down a gorgeous lake in gorgeous surrounds!? Arguably the best cheesecake and coffee combo in town. So they say — when in Rome! When in Copenhagen, do as the Danes do and ride a bike around the city for the day. Not only is this the best way to get around but also the most economical!  If you’re interest in Danish royalty or just willing to visit to admire the palatial proportions, Christiansborg is centrally located and worthy of a visit. There are a number of museums in Copenhagen but this one in particular grabbed our attention and surely will be your choice of the bunch, too. The collection is striking but the interior is enough reason to visit in itself. The name itself deems a “snegl” worthy of trying as it resembles a snail in shape, takes the form of puff pastry and is generously covered in cinnamon and sugar. Yes, really. If you’re interested in churches (they can be quite overdone throughout a larger Europe itinerary), then one to go out of your way for is the Church of our Saviour, a baroque 17th-century structure with a delicate and intricate interior. Three words: just do it. Also, do it more than once. Do it thrice or even more. The rough English translation is “cream balls”, though that doesn’t really do it justice. There are many different flavours and spins on the classic so be sure to try a few.  As we all know, Copenhagen is incredibly expensive, especially in comparison to other European capitals. A great way to skip the hefty prices is to eat the street (street food stalls are in abundance) – starting with these delicious churros on the main shopping street! This impressive palace is the winter home of the Danish royal family and is certainly worth a visit whilst in the city. Be sure to snap some photos with the (very) serious guards! Although one of the most expensive restaurants in the city, a night at Geranium would be one to remember for your lifetime. Gastronomy is a huge part of modern day culture in the Scandinavian countries and Copenhagen is no exception. Be sure to book ahead and set aside plenty of cash to foot the bill. Also known as the marble church, this is a great site to stop at if you’ve ticked all of the above off the list. This 17th-century tower (known as the round tower) offers great views over the city for 25DDK."
156,"As one of the most popular islands in Greece, Mykonos is as iconic as they come. With such a renowned reputation thanks to its picture-perfect streets and well-preserved heritage, the island is one of the most populated islands on the tourist-island-hopping itinerary of Greece. This complete guide to Mykonos will help you make the most of your time on the island. Mykonos gained popularity in the 1930s when many celebrities, artists and affluent Europeans began to flock to the island in the summertime. The culture has rapidly evolved and many visitors arriving in Mykonos are drawn to the party scene, international music acts and parties that continue past dawn.  The Windmills are located on the western side of town and are considered an icon of Mykonos. Here is where you can also enjoy the best sunset view in Mykonos, overlooking Little Venice below as the night culture begins to kick into gear. Little Venice is next on the list of things to see, known for its medieval two and three-story houses on the water. With colour pops and a certain romance to it, this is a great place to grab a drink and enjoy watching the sunset, from where you can also view the windmills above. Elia Beach offers the best in beach culture as one of the largest beaches, located 8 kilometres from the town of Mykonos. Delos is an outlying UNESCO World Heritage island and a great nearby day trip if you’re after a dose of history. Lena’s House Museum shows visitors an insight into 19th-century Mykonian way of life, though opening hours are limited to the evenings (closed Sundays). Panagia Paraportiani is the most impressive church in town and also a great photo opportunity.  With so many international visitors passing through and the demand high, prices in Mykonos skyrocket over the busy summer period. Below you will find a few highlights I came across on my travels, though for more options I would recommend asking around for local recommendations. Markos Falafel – my fellow vegetarians rejoice! I was so excited to stumble upon a vegetarian-friendly option that served mouth-watering cheap eats. Reeza Restaurant – another great find for my veggie (and vegan) friends! The food was exceptional, particularly if you’re after a more sit down affair. Happyo – sometimes you just feel like ice cream. This place is also vegan friendly and surprisingly good, like, REALLY GOOD. Try the vegan chocolate sorbet!   Follow more of my adventures on Instagram!"
157,"Right before leaving for my annal Spring trip to Paris this year, I received a copy of a new book in the mail titled Sundays in Paris. Just as the title would suggest, the book follows a detailed list of suggestions for where to spend your Sundays in Paris: from brunch spots to your coffee fix, this book is as comprehensive as it gets! So while I was in Paris this time around, I wanted to dedicate my two Sundays to exploring some of the suggestions and to narrow down my favourite neighbourhoods to spend a Sunday in Paris. Sundays offer a completely different experience in the French capital – with a mix of locals and tourists coming out to enjoy the sunshine, sip a coffee from the front of a local cafe, or meet with friends for an “avo toast” (an Australian staple the French seem to have adopted!) So if you’re looking to enjoy the perfectly French Sunday in Paris, here’s how to do it…  First things first: fuel up on a delicious breakfast at your local coffee or at the very least, get some caffeine! Sundays are a slow start in Paris so don’t rush out of bed too soon – you’ll struggle to find anything open before 8:00am. The gates to Notre Dame officially open at 9:00am on a Sunday, but an insider tip: they often open early. If you’re visiting during Spring and wish to enjoy cherry blossom season, this is one of the best places to do so!  The beginning of it all, Île de la Cité is where Paris truly began. This island is home to Notre Dame cathedral after all and is the beating heart of Paris. Spend at least an hour wandering through the magical alleyways and pick up a crepe or coffee to go – we’ve got a lot of walking to do today!  Much of the Sundays in Paris book centres around Le Marais and for good reason. The historic Jewish quarter bursts to life on Sundays, given the Jewish religion dubs Friday and Saturday the weekend, making Sunday the liveliest days to be in Le Marais because unlike much of Paris, everything is open! The heart of Le Marais is, in my opinion, Place des Vosges – one of the most beautiful public parks in all of Paris and indeed a personal favourite. If you’re looking for a coffee, food or sugar fix, these recommendations are as good as it gets: Fragments Cafe – one of the best coffees in the city, hands down. Only a short walk from Place des Vosges and has a killer cinnamon bun (just ask anyone from the area). Carette – One of my favoured patisseries in Paris and my favourite version of the salted caramel macaron. This is a particularly good place for people watching, so pull up a seat if you’re hungry – they serve great traditional light French fare. Wild & the Moon – The perfect healthy alternative if you’re feeling a little fed up of rich buttery French food (it happens to the best of us). They make a killer acai bowl and have takeaway juices, too. Juice Lab – Speaking of great juices, right opposite the Place des Vosges is this little juicery with to-go goodies if you’re in need of a little pick me up. Hank Burger – Another vegan offering but more of a “vegan junk food” approach. Unusually delicious, even for the nonvegans! L’as du Fallafel – The best fallafel you will probably have in your lifetime, for a really (really) low price. This place is an institution and although the line will be long, it moves fast.  Walking onwards toward another favourite neighbourhood of mine, Canal Saint Martin first took my attention in the film Amelie, which follows a young French woman as she approaches the meaning to life. Canal Saint Martin has a handful of charming boutiques and eateries to discover, but for certain my favourite would have to be Du Pain et Idees – commonly regarded as one of the best bakeries in Paris. Unfortunately it is closed on weekends – so you’ll have to save it for another day on your trip! It would be wise to visit earlier on in the day as this place sells out fast. This neighbourhood is really just lovely to walk around and if you’re coming from Le Marais, be sure to stop at Merci concept store located on Boulevard Beaumarchais.  Last but not least, my beloved Montmartre. Montmartre was the first neighbourhood I ever stayed at in Paris and as such, my first introduction to the city. I was seventeen years of age when I first arrived in Paris, having dragged my father on a trip through Rome, Paris, Krakow and Kiev in order to visit my cousin who was living in Ukraine at the time. Commonly known as the artists’ district, this hillside arrondissement really comes to life on a Sunday afternoon. There are artists and buskers every which way you look – many of them wonderful, many of them not as much so – but all of them creating a contagious love for art that really makes this neighbourhood so romantic. Below are some specific recommendations, should you have a particular craving: The Hardware Societe – The best French toast (maybe in all of Paris). Neighbours – Exceptional coffee in a really lovely setting. Soul Kitchen – A great veggie/vegan friendly option in a humble atmosphere. Rue des Martyrs – My favourite street to walk the length of from top to bottom. You will find many local artisans here and quirky one off stores. It reminds me of “old Paris” in more ways than one.  "
158,"As one of the leading hotels of the Amalfi region, Le Sirenuse in Positano is truly a destination in its own league. And whether you plan to stay, play or eat, here is what you can expect of this incredible hotel. After having the pleasure of staying at Le Sirenuse this summer, I’m excited to share my takeaways. So if you’re considering booking this hotel or dropping by for a visit at the restaurant, read on!  Le Sirenuse first opened its doors in 1951, when four Neopolitan siblings refurbished their families’ summer vacation home in Positano and brought their vision to life for a boutique luxury hotel on Amalfi’s coastline. Initially the hotel opened with 8 rooms in a building which can still be seen as part of the hotel to this day, however you can now add to that an additional 50 rooms, a sizeable growth but one that has been contained to retain the family-run feeling this small luxury hotel offers to keep guests returning year after year.  For our stay we checked in to the a deluxe superior sea view room, which really is just a fancy name for a beautifully white and bright interior, ample space, and an unrivalled view of the town and sea. Absolutely no attention to detail is overlooked, with a lush corner plant, colourful mosaic tiles, art work throughout the room and a beautiful terrace lined with flowers and overlooking the sea. Rooms include the hotel’s very own line of luxury bath amenities, with a selection of colognes and perfumes to add a personalised touch. There is a small television in the room if you should ever tire of the view (believe me when I say that will most certainly not happen – morning, noon or night! Though if you should be looking for a night in, the hotel offer an extensive list of DVDs to borrow at your leisure.  Le Sirenuse is renowned for its incredible view and I was delighted to learn on arrival that not only do you enjoy such views from the comfort of your room, but also in a range of public terraces available to guests throughout each floor of the hotel. Moreover, the hotel has almost direct access to the beach with a private elevator that leads guests a mere 150 steps away from the beach itself! During the summer season the hotel opens its pool for guest use, with an impressive terrace restaurant open throughout the day for breakfast, lunch and later in the evenings as it switches to its popular Michelin menu. The level of service on offer at this particular hotel is distinguished by the fact that it has remained in the same family for more than half a century, with hotel guests and outside guests who are visiting the hotel restaurant always made to feel like an invited guest to a private party. In terms of arriving at the hotel, Positano is located 60km from Naples train station, with the easiest mode of transport being a private driver, particularly if you are not confident navigating the Amalfi Coast roads in a small car (the roads are narrow and feature more than their fair share of hairpin turns). Alternatively you can catch a ferry to Capri and change to a ferry to Positano, or, as we did, catch the train to Sorrento for a few nights and then venture onwards by either ferry or public SITA bus to Positano. The bus station (Sponda, the second stop in Positano if travelling from Sorrento) is a short 200 metre walk from the hotel.  World of Wanderlust visited Positano as a guest of Le Sirenuse & Leading Hotels of the World. All opinions and oodles of photos remain my own!"
159,"As the most renowned ski resort in Switzerland, Zermatt brings to life all your expectations of what a ski holiday should be. The picturesque chateaus nestled high in the mountainous terrain and the panoramic views set the scene, with the world-famous Matterhorn glowing in the background. So, we bring to you a complete guide to Zermatt Switzerland!  No matter where you choose to base yourself in Zermatt, you will never be too far away from the happenings in town as everything is relatively close to reach on foot. In town you can choose from a variety of restaurants to cater to your budget (they even have a McDonalds which is by no means a recommendation when you have so much great local food to try, but to allow for scope!) In town you will also find a great range of swiss chocolatiers if you’re looking to satisfy your sweet tooth! Crêpes seem to be a real hit too, with a few crêperies to be found in the main street and many cafes serving them on the menu. If you’ve forgotten anything before hitting the slopes you will have no trouble at all finding ski goggles and sportswear galore in town, as well as a plethora of souvenir shops selling everything from ear muffs through to cow bells. If you don’t plan to ski there is still plenty to do to keep yourself busy for 5-7 days in Zermatt, ranging from an ice skating rink through to the central Matterhorn Museum. However most vacationers arrive to hit the slopes, so if you haven’t been skiing before you should still consider lessons, as despite the Intermediate-Advanced rating of most of the mountain, you will still find some slopes suited for beginners (especially around Sunnegan – read on for more).  Although small in size, Zermatt is first and foremost a vacation ski town, so there are plenty of accommodations on offer. However it should be said early on that Zermatt is one of Switzerland’s premier ski destinations and prices are steep, not only with the most expensive ski lift passes in the country but also some of the most expensive hotel and chalet rates. Tempston Luxury offer some of the best catered and self-catered private properties! Rent a luxury ski chalet in Zermatt through Tempston and expect nothing less than a private pool, hot tub, sauna, staff and more! For our time in Zermatt we checked in to a comfortable four star ski hotel, the Sunstar Style Hotel. Nothing is too far away in Zermatt, but this hotel was ideally located a 5-10 minute walk from the city centre and thus far enough away from the business of town without being far to walk to the centre of everything. If you’re looking for the best of the best, the Hotel Monte Rosa is a great pick in the centre of Zermatt, or for something a little more secluded check yourself in to The Omnia.  One thing is for sure when in Zermatt – you will be amazed at the sheer size of the mountain and all its offerings, often feeling overwhelmed by how much there is to see in so little time (you could easily spend a week or two here!) For a full map of the slopes, lifts and trains, see here. For advanced skiers around 20% of the mountain is classified as black and there are ample opportunities to ski off piste, though a local guide is recommended before tackling this kind of terrain! For intermediate skiers there are endless slopes to choose from in three main sectors, including the option to ski across the border in to Italy. Tow thirds of the runs on the mountain are classed as red, so you will have ample opportunity to experience different aspects of the mountain. Cervinia is a great place to start and offers the chance to view the Matterhorn up close! For beginner skiers (like myself!), Zermatt can at first seem quite intimidating, with only 16% of the mountain classed as blue runs. Sunnegga is a great place to start with a few gentle slopes to warm up on, followed by a few blue slopes to experience once you’ve gained your confidence. Other spots for beginners include Täsch ski lift and Randa ski lift.  If this is your first time in Switzerland then prepare yourself for the abundance of flavours in the rich Swiss cuisine (I’m drooling just remembering some of these dishes – rosti, cremeschnitte and oodles of cheese!) Said to be the best value for money is the popular monutain Restaurant Chez Vrony, home to moderately priced, delicious and classic Swiss cuisine. Another popular choice also in the mountain is Findlerhof, with views of the matterhorn on a clear day. For cheese lovers, be sure to pop into Saycheese! to try a local Swiss delicacy; the cheese fondue! This is a real treat in the wintertime as it really warms you from the insides out. And for fine diners there is a range of gastronomical restaurants on offer throughout town – just don’t expect to leave with change in your pocket!  Getting to Zermatt is a journey in itself, as the easiest and most time friendly way to arrive is by train, though connections with Zurich, Basel and Geneva are all over 3 hours in duration. Bern is the closest Swiss city to connect from, though flights in to the capital are limited. Zurich is extremely well connected with international destinations so may be the easiest city to fly in to from abroad. We flew with Emirates, who offer 3 flights per day from Dubai. From there, the train journey takes roughly 3-3.5 hours with 1 or 2 connections. Geneva is also well connected, though the train journey to Zermatt is a little longer at 3 hours and 50 minutes, with a change in Visp. Travelling by car is slightly shorted (at under 3 hours), though you must leave your car at Tasch as Zermatt is car free, offering electronic buses and taxis to transport visitors around the town. Another viable option is to fly in to Basel (a popular choice for budget airlines within Europe), with a train journey of 3 hours and 15 minutes, requiring one or two changes.  World of Wanderlust stayed at the Sunstar Hotel as a guest of Zermatt Tourism, however all opinions and oodles of photos are my own!"
160,"Amsterdam might be one of Europe’s most alternative cities, but just a thirty-minute train from the tourist-ridden streets of Amsterdam you will find the medieval city of Utrecht. With some of Europe’s most beautiful canals, Utrecht is largely populated by students resulting in a city filled with concept stores, cafes and a vibrant nightlife all with a secret edge that mirrors Amsterdam. So what are you waiting for? Here’s your complete guide to Utrecht! While the Dutch thing to do is explore a city by bike, if you feel more comfortable with two feet on the ground, Utrecht Free Tours will make sure you see the city with a twist. While the company run your regular run of the mill city tours, they also offer a “Dark Side of Utrecht Tour”, “Sex, Drugs & Squatting Tour” and a “Medieval Utrecht” tour. Visible from almost everywhere in the city centre, Utrecht’s most iconic site is the Dom tower. This makes for a great landmark if you ever get lost. This is also where you will gain the best vantage point over the city and see it from above. If you’re of the best sites, you can check out Pandhof garden, Janskerkhof flower markets on a Saturday morning and UNESCO heritage Rietveld Schröder House. Utrecht is a coffee lovers haven. In the city centre you’ll be spoilt for choice. 30ml (some locations also do brunch), Koffieboontje and The Village Coffee will all ensure your cravings are satisfied. If you’re looking to head a little further, Koffie Leute not only has delicious coffee and brownies, but if you manage to nab the couch in the window or the spot in front of the Nintendo’s, you’ll find yourself people watching or playing video games for hours. Other honourable mentions should go to MØS, Rocking Chair and Puschkin Ontbijt & Lunch. Oudegracht is the main canal through Utrecht, with several smaller canals winding throughout the city. There are plenty of ways to experience the canals, if you’re feeling a little more adventurous there are kayaks and paddleboats that can be rented along the Oudegracht and they make for a beautiful way to spend the day. There are routes that will allow you to loop the city or alternatively head out to the more suburban areas (one will even lead you to a pancake house!) Looking for a coffee shop in the Netherlands can be a bit of a cultural faux pas. Do you mean a coffee shop or a “coffee” shop? But the unsubtle aromas that surround the Culture Boat will ensure that in this case you are not mistaken. The most ambient and unique of coffee shops in Utrecht finds itself at home on one of Utrecht’s canals as it is quite literally on a boat. Spend your afternoon playing board games or reading a book; hours will pass before you even know it. Of course you’ll need to provide ID on entry. By now you’re probably feeling hungry or in need of drink, or both. During the warmer months, Neude – a square in the city centre – is filled with life. There are endless bars and restaurants in the square, so you’re sure to find something that tickles your fancy. No guide to Utrecht would be complete without mention of the foodie scene, as this is a staple in Dutch cities! Syr – offers Middle Eastern food cooked and served in collaboration with refugees in Utrecht LE:EN – does delicious Asian fusion, in a huge converted warehouse. It’s also right near some great bars such as Kleijn Berlijn Olivier – if you want something really unique, check out this old church that has been turned into a Belgian Beer cafe. P.s keep an eye out for the resident cat, he’s very cute! Eetcafé Stathe – the go to for a craft beer and possibly some live music.
Film Café – situated in an old warehouse they regularly screen movies, host markets and have discos. Soia – Situated at Utrecht’s attempt at a beach, it will always be packed on a nice day in summer. Looking for more? Here’s a look at all of our guides in the Netherlands.  "
161,"Lake Bled is one of Slovenia’s most popular destinations. The iconic blue lake features a small island, impressive castle overlooking the lake and many great activities in summer. These are the best things to do in Lake Bled to help you plan your visit. If you’re looking for a view over the lake from above, there is no better way to see Lake Bled than from Mala Osojnica. The hike takes around an hour return, plus a little time to stay at the top and enjoy the views. The hike is easy but quite steep, so be sure to plan your visit for the start of the day or the end of the day to beat the summer sun! When you visit Lake Bled you are in the Gorenjskan part of Slovenia and there are many great local dishes to try for a taste of the region. Dumplings are prominent on menus and the meals are often hearty and huge. Vila Bled has a beautiful restaurant with the best view of Bled Island, so this is the perfect spot to enjoy traditional cuisine with the best view in town. Don’t forget to try the famous Bled Cake for dessert – a pastry cake filled with a delicious custard centre. This cake is so good I will probably talk about it for months to come. Rowing a boat around the lake more difficult than it looks (more on that later). If you’re more inclined to be rowed to your destination, then jump on board a pletna boat for a leisurely ride to Bled Island. You’ll find these boats on the island side of the lake and they’re running all the time, to and from the island. Feeling an independent streak coming on? Another great way to reach the island is to row yourself on one of the hire boats available in the same area. I was staying at Vila Bled and enjoyed an hour free hire, though I probably only lasted half the time (it is much harder than it looks!) Regardless of the circular path I accidentally took, it was a really fun way to experience the lake and enjoy the summer sun. Just a 10-15 minute drive from Lake Bled, Vintgar Gorge is one of the most beautiful locations in Slovenia. Another way to get here is to cycle or walk, given its close proximity to Lake Bled. The Gorge is open 7:00am ~ 8:00pm in the summer months and less hours during the colder months. During summer this place is heaving with tourist traffic, so I would highly recommend arriving early. Read more: How to visit Vintgar Gorge Slovenia is full of wonderful castles to explore and there is no denying Bled Castle is one of the highlights. Set idyllically on top of one of the highest points surrounding the island, Bled Castle is a living museum. According to sources, this is the oldest castle in Slovenia and thanks to restoration processes has been kept in great shape. Another bonus: the views over Lake Bled from the castle are iconic! If you haven’t heard about it yet consider yourself warned. Bled Cake is a calorific extravaganza of deliciousness that can not and should not be ignored. The cake features a pastry base and top, with a delicious custard centre and creamy layer above. It is incredibly rich, sweet and more-ish. You can try the cake at almost any restaurant or cafe around the lake, though I would highly recommend visiting Cafe Belvedere for your slice (the views are to die for). However you make your way over to the island, be sure to climb the almost 100 steps to the tower and ring the bell at the top of the church. The bell can be heard all day long around the lake from enthusiastic bell ringers and is a great addition to the lakeside setting. Whether you stay your entire time here or just one night, I cannot recommend enough checking in to Vila Bled. The villa has an unbeatable location on the lake and many of the rooms have direct views to Bled island. You can wake up each morning and wander down the stairs to the lake in an instant or enjoy the private beach and complimentary boat rentals at the front of the hotel. Triglav National Park is within a short drive from Lake Bled and if you have more than two days in Bled, I would highly recommend visiting. There are some great day hikes in the park or if you prefer more of a leisurely visit, Lake Bohinj is a great place to relax away from the crowds of Lake Bled.  Safe and happy travels!"
162,"For the final stop on my tour throughout the Netherlands, I was determined to go as South as possible to see another side to this country (and besides, my next stop was France!) Maastricht is quite different to the rest of the Netherlands, particularly as it begins to get hilly in the South, something I got so used to avoiding when riding bikes in the rest of the Netherlands! I arrived in the city on a Sunday – Mother’s Day to be exact – to find that much of the city was closed until 1pm for the celebration of mother’s day (at least that’s what a waiter told me). Thus I had just one half day to explore before I caught the train onwards to St Gerlach, a gorgeous chateau in the Dutch countryside. Here’s a quick guide from my short visit to the city!  I arrived in Maastricht in the early hours of the morning, preparing myself for a big day of adventuring around the city. I soon learned that in the Netherlands Sunday trading is a new concept introduced only last year, so the stores were not opening until 12 noon at the earliest. With plenty of time to kill I began wandering around the cities’ cobblestone streets, finding myself plenty of cafes and stores to return to when the city opened. The walk from the train station takes only 10 minutes or so and follows one road (the one you exit the station from) directly to the city centre. On the way be sure to stop at Bread & Delicious for some of the yummiest macarons you can find in Europe for a bargain €1.10!  This was by far the highlight of the city for me, a self-confessed book worm who had already bought 3 too many books on this trip. The Dominicanen bookstore is housed in an old church and is considered to be one of the most beautiful book stores in the world (you can surely see why!) Get directions  Whilst in the church/bookstore, be sure to grab a drink or small bite at “Coffee lovers”, a cafe inside the bookstore which gives a perfect excuse to open a book and let the world pass you by. The yoghurt-strawberry smoothie was a great pick-me-up that also doubled as a half-lunch!  As one would come to expect from this blog, I made it my business to seek out the best macarons in the city and BOY did Maastricht not disappoint! I could have happily eaten the entire tray of salted caramel macarons from Bread & Delicious, located between the main train station and centre of town (conveniently, where I passed at 10:00 am and still loaded up). Sadly they were closed when I went to return later in the day (they close at 1:00 pm on Sundays) and closed again the following day (closing on Mondays is also a thing here). BY THE WAY, the macarons are €1.10 each at the time of writing this blog. All the more reason to stock up before Paris!!!  In the centre of town is where you will find the liveliness of this city. Many street vendors line up to showcase their local produce, making for the perfect excuse to try (and buy) some cheese! From here you will notice a lot of locals and tourists enjoying a meal al fresco style. I soon noticed that the Dutch love an excuse to get outdoors (after all, sunshine is a rarity at times) and you’ll find some great cafes around here.  A little outside of the centre of the city you will find Koffie, arguably the best coffee in town and a part of Maastricht’s “Design Route”. The Design Route is full of galleries and concept stores that will have you inspired in no time.  But of course, the biggest drawcard of this city is just to wander at leisure and enjoy the relaxed lifestyle here in the South. Maastricht is close in proximity to France, Germany and Belgium, making for a unique blend of cultures, languages and people. If you have more time be sure to rent a bicycle to explore the outer rims of the city and perhaps even venture onwards to the Dutch countryside! I hope you enjoyed this guide to Maastricht. Please let me know in the comments which recommendations were most useful for your visit!"
163,"Located just five kilometres from the coast of Naples is the popular resort island of Capri, a summer escape for locals and international visitors alike, all holidaying in search of their very own La Dolce Vita or “The Sweet Life”. As a sweet escape from reality, Capri has much to offer visitors throughout the warmer months, so read on for a complete guide to Capri! And if you’re looking for more, visit our guide and map of the Amalfi Coast towns to visit.  Arriving in Capri is almost always by ferry or private charter, from nearby Naples (40 minutes by ferry), Sorrento (20 minutes by ferry) or Positano (50 minutes by ferry). You will then arrive at Marina Grande, the ferry terminal and first port of entry to the island. Here you will be bombarded with the stream of crowds and locals waiting to sell you something – anything – or provide transport for the day. It is better to arrive prepared and with a plan so as to ensure not being ripped off and to make the most of your time on the island.  There are a few ways to get around the island but before naming these, it should be noted that Capri is a rather large island to get around, although the majority of tourists manage to make their way around on foot or with the funicular to reach Capri Town, spending the majority of their time there in the many hotels or meandering the streets on a day visit. Should you wish to see more of Capri beyond this, your two best options are: For a few hours you can hire a vespa at a reasonable 40 euros, including time, gas, and insurance. This allows you to see the island at your own leisure with this amount of time allowing you to see the highlights, though not giving you much time in each. Should you prefer to see and do all the activities on offer (such as the Blue Grotto boat trip), then you can always hire the vespa for an hour or two longer by paying an extension fee upon return. We found this the best way to get around and see the island at our own pace, stopping in to different parts of the island with a hand-drawn map offered to us by the vespa rental cashier. As soon as you arrive in Capri you will notice an endless stream of taxis (many with the top down!!!) ready to take you wherever you wish to go on the island. You can pay them to take you directly to Capri town or hire them for a few hours to drive you from point to point around the island, giving you some amazing views and the experience of driving cliffside up the peaks of the island! Another option is to walk from the Marina to Capri town on foot, in around 25 minutes uphill and less time as you come back down. There are also public buses running throughout the island which provides a cheaper option, though limits your freedom to experience the island on your own time.  Although quite small, Capri suddenly becomes a lot bigger as you aim to whizz around the island and see everything in a day. To truly enjoy the island I would recommend staying a few nights, allowing time to kick back and enjoy the sunrise and sunset, particularly as the day crowds leave at around 5:00pm and you have the island to yourself. Your first point of call should be Capri Town, especially if you’re looking for the quintessential Capri atmosphere – with gorgeous roof terraces, fresh flavours on your plate, and a healthy dose of gelato to combat the summer sun. If you plan on seeing more of the island beyond popular Capri (town), head on over to AnaCapri for a more local vibe and make your way down to the southern coastline for impressive views of the cliff edges. Another popular spot for day visitors is to see the Blue Grotto caves. As this is so popular I would suggest arriving early to beat the crowds or making your way over by land, without the additional boat tour.  Not only the name of the island, Capri is also the name of one of the island’s two towns. This is undeniably the most popular spot for visitors, particularly day visitors arriving from Naples, Sorrento or Positano. Many of the best restaurants, bars and views are found here, so be sure to check out: There really is no better gelateria in town, if you manage to find it! We found ourselves wandering back and forth until a local pointed us in the right direction and even then we had trouble locating it amongst the busy crowds! I opted for dark chocolate and hazelnut flavours – both delicious with an extremely creamy texture – some of the best gelato from our trip to Italy! Located a mere 100 metres from Piazzetta di Capri is this incredibly popular, swanky restaurant with more than 200 Italian wines on offer.    We hope you enjoyed this guide to Capri, for more travel inspiration ~ Follow us on Instagram."
164,"When you think of French food you’d be forgiven for thinking surely all good food comes from France. If you ask me, it does. But simply saying “French food” when referring to the likes of fine pastries, quiche lorraine or brie cheese isn’t quite enough. Each food from France originates from a particular region of France, with each region extremely proud of their delicacy. It is such pride that ensures you get the best of each item in its’ region, even if you can find a quiche lorraine at almost every bakery in the country. So, where should you go for the best of your favourite French food item? Read below for a complete list! Centring around the French capital, Paris, this area may be considered the epicentre of French culinary pursuits and especially if we narrow it down to just Paris! With great transport connections to the rest of France, almost all visitors to France pass through Paris (its kinda obligatory if you ask me!) So, the best culinary delights to indulge in in the City of Lights? Think delicate pastries… and lots of them! Start off by trying a macaron, followed up by some brioche for good measure. See here for my favourite patisseries to visit in Paris. With a seafront location, it comes at no surprise that the region of Normandy specialises in seafood. “Must try” dishes for seafood eaters include matelote (fish stewed in cider) and Moules à la crème Normande (mussels cooked in white wine, cider, garlic and cream). For the non seafood eaters (hello!), go for the Tarte Normande… delicious for sweet tooths! Image: Igor Plotnikov / Shutterstock I’m sure it also comes as no surprise that the Champagne region of France is famous for, yes, you guessed it; Champagne. Be sure to pair your wine tasting with Brie de Meaux (cheese) for the ultimate pairing! This region is also famous for their sausage offerings – notably andouillette de Troyes (pork sausage) and boudin blanc (white sausage).  Unsurprisingly, the region of Lorraine is best known for their famous quiche lorraine, which has made its way across the world. The quiche consists of pastry, filled with a centre of bacon, cheese and eggs. Vegetarians will rejoice in the numerous veggie alternatives on offer (so long as it has cheese, I’m there!) Another notable French favourite deriving from Lorraine is the Madeleine (a small cake with orange blossom). The Alsace region is one of my favourite in all of France, not just because of the spectacular architecture but also the food! For some reason everything seems to taste better in Alsace (they’ve got a long history of world class pastry chefs), though if you’re looking for a regional speciality, I suggest you start with baeckeoffe or carpe frites. Located on the border to Germany, this region has a heavy German influence so you’ll find plenty of unique dishes (many are more heartier + heavier) that you won’t find elsewhere in France. I’ve got two words for you: Foie gras. Being a vegetarian I can assure you that duck/goose liver really isn’t a dish that excites me, but I know plenty of meat eaters who jump at the opportunity to indulge at fancy French restaurants. This dish originates from the Aquitaine region and it is hands down their most famous dish. Image: Love to Escape There are a few dishes Limousin is renowned for, but none more exciting to me than a Paté de pomme de terre. This potato pie is a peasant’s dream: plenty of potatoes and plenty of butter. What more could you need!? Image: About France Did someone say Crêpes!? As far as French food by region goes, you must make your way to Brittany. Although you’ll find eleventy-hundred crêpe stands all over Paris, the thin pancakes actually originate from Brittany. Sweet or savoury, hot or cold, these things are your ultimate lunch-on-the-go. The Loire Valley, a day trip from Paris, is another of my favourite regions in France. Beautiful countryside, spring blooms, magical chateaus… I really don’t have a bad memory of this place. Except, of course, when I was offered a “vegetarian” quiche that was very much a tuna quiche. One bite into it and that thing came straight back out. The two dishes most famous here are andouillettes (sausage) and rillettes (paste made from braised pork fat). Neither excite me, but they might excite you! I don’t think there’s region of France I have not enjoyed, but definitely in my top three favourite experiences was my visit to Burgundy a few years back. One of my fondest memories was hiring a bicycle and (appallingly) navigating the French roads to arrive on the wine route, vineyard hopping from one town to another. Aside from the wine, escargot is a regional delicacy here, though my veggie preference was the delicious Gruyère Cheese Gougères. Oh – my – goodness. You will thank me later. And then there’s Provence with its’ quince and aioli. Sure, there are many foods this region is famous for – but for lovers of sauces (and all things drowning in sauce), you can’t beat taste testing aioli in its’ motherland. For those who have been living under a rock, aioli is garlic mayonnaise, sent directly from the heavens above. Over to you! Do you have any additions you would like to contribute!? We hope you enjoyed this guide to French food by region!"
165,"In Italy it is always so much to see, so little time. With impressive cities, endless history, fantastic cuisine and friendly locals, no time is ever enough in Italy. People always ask me “Where should I go in Italy?” to which I can honestly respond “Everywhere!” Yes, the country really is that spectacular and there is so much to see. So if you’re planning your first trip to Italy and want to hit up all the highlights; this is your complete guide to seeing Italy by rail.  Start your Italian journey in Milan, the financial centre of Italy and a busting metropolis filled with fashion, arts, and great cuisine (though you’ll find the latter everywhere in Italy!) You only really need one night in Milan to get over the jet lag, as well as seeing the impressive Milan Cathedral (probably the most impressive in all of Europe), Leonardo Da Vinci’s last supper mural and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. Stay: 1 night Read more: What not to miss in Milan  On your second day catch the train to Como and begin exploring the Italian lakes district.

One night will give you just enough time to wander the streets and indulge in some street sweet treats. Stay: 1 night Read more: One day in Verona  Image via Expedia.com If the name sounds familiar, you’re probably thinking of bolognese. And yes, Bologna is the birthplace of bolognese. Stop in at Bologna for just a few hours to eat the dish in its hometown and climb the tower for a great view over the city. Stay: Day Trip  Onwards to Cinque Terre, the gorgeous coastal area of cliffside towns, and plenty of them! You will need to transfer to a bus in order to make the full journey, as Cinque Terre itself is not connected to a train line. This region is a great excuse to wander without rhyme or reason, with your hardest choice for the day being which gelato flavour to indulge in! Stay: 3 nights Read more: Cinque Terre Guide  And now for my favourite city in Italy; Florence. This would have to be one of my favourite places in the whole world, especially in the summer sunshine. There’s plenty to see and do in the city itself, but you’ll need to reserve one full day for a Tuscany vineyard experience out of town. Ahhh how I miss Firenze! Stay: 4 nights Read more: You Can’t go to Florence & Not see these 20 Attractions  On one of your afternoons in Florence, catch the train onwards to nearby Pisa to see the sight in which this town is made famous for: the leaning tower of Pisa. The food is much cheaper here than in Florence, so perhaps make it a lunch stopover and you’ve got a win-win! Stay: Day Trip  Rome, the eternal city. There really isn’t a city in the world quite like Rome and no other city has ever had the power to make me feel so young and so small. The city is ancient, overbearing, and at times overhwelming. But you absolutely cannot cut yourself short on time here – there is just so much to see and do! Stay: 4 nights Read more: Rome Bucket List  Onwards to the Amalfi Coast with your first stop being Naples, the birthplace of pizza!

This is for sure my favourite area in Italy to stop, unwind, and soak up that Italian sunshine. Be sure to spend a couple of nights in Sorrento, take a day trip to Capri, spend a further two nights in Positano and make a further day trip to both Amalfi & Ravello.

The cookies come personally recommended! Get directions Happy travels in Lyon!"
167,"When most people decide to make a visit to Pisa Italy, it is no secret they’re heading here for that iconic photo in front of or holding up the world-famous leaning tower of Pisa. When I was seventeen years old I travelled to Europe for the first time with my dad, and insisted we travel all the way by train from Rome in a day to do just that. Now, some eight years later and a few more destinations under my belt, I travelled back to Pisa to discover the city beyond the tower. Discover for your in this quick guide to Pisa!  If you come to Pisa insistent that all you want to see is the leaning tower (for which this city is oh so famous for), I can assure you that you’ll miss the beauty of this small city. Recently Pisa has become another gateway to Tuscany, with the introduction of direct flights with Qatar airways, making it possible to reach Pisa in just a couple of flights from almost anywhere (you’ll need to fly to Doha first, then direct flights are available daily to Pisa). The city of Pisa is undeniably best explored early morning or late at night, as it is then when you will discover the true beauty (beyond the summer tourist crowds) and if you’re a morning person, you will have the city almost entirely to yourself! The city centre itself is very small, so stick to walking if you wish to uncover the true beauty: found in the many small shops, cafes and restaurants.  Most tourists come to Pisa just to see the leaning tower. Sure, it is a sight for the eyes and also one of the biggest engineering failures… but there is much more to Pisa to discover (even if you only have a day!) Leaning Tower of Pisa – Of course you can’t come to pisa and not see the leaning tower! Check out the vintage travel photo of seventeen-year-old-me with the tower below (cringe!) Pisa Duomo – Next to the tower you will see the gorgeous facade of the Duomo – well worth a visit inside, especially for art lovers! Baptistry – Also within the same vicinity (known as the Field of Miracles) is the Battistero (Baptistry). Here you will find one of the best views of Pisa, as it includes the leaning tower in your frame (and has much less stairs to climb!) Piazza della Carovana – This small town square positions you in the centre of many of the cities’ most important buildings, however it is important to note that most of these are not open to visitors (but still worth a look from the outside!) Ponte Di Mezzo – For a great view of the Arno river either side, take a walk to Ponte Di Mezzo either early morning or afternoon to catch the best light of day. Santa Maria della Spina – This small church on the Arno river with a gothic facade was one of my favourite architectural finds in Pisa. You’ll find it nearest to Ponte Solferino, one bridge away from Ponte Di Mezzo (the church is in between the two). As a general rule, try to eat away from the Leaning Tower, as prices are hiked up for tourists. The streets between the train station and the tower are full of great little cafes and restaurants to discover – though you may find opening hours are a little sporadic (aren’t they always in Italy!?) Below are some personal favourite finds: Oro Gelateria – Superrrrrrb gelato. The best you’ll find in Pisa. La Mescita – If you’re looking for a wine bar with tasty eats, look no further. Gusto Giusto – Put down the menu and ask Gianni (the owner) for his recommendations.  Although there is plenty to see and do in Pisa to warrant a full day here, most tourists visit for just half a day on a day trip from Florence. The other half of the day is usually spent at Lucca, a nearby city that is just as charming (perhaps even more so) and very lively throughout the day. If you’re short on time, be sure to fit the two (Pisa and Lucca) in one day trip from Florence. However if you find yourself with more time, I would suggest to take it slow and spend a day in each as the cities both have a completely different vibe in the evenings (when the locals come out!) I flew to Tuscany on a direct route with Qatar Airways. Flying from Australia, this meant just two flights to reach the Tuscan region: Melbourne – Doha & Doha – Pisa. I would highly recommend this route for travellers interested in basing their trip in Tuscany, a region that warrants at least one, but up to three weeks to discover. With thanks to Qatar Airways for welcoming me to experience Tuscany on this new direct route!"
168,"Whilst most people might think of Italy as the European capital of ice cream, neighbouring France is also a strong contender in the fight for the title. Paris not only offers a vast selection of traditional French ice cream parlours, it is also home to a select few gelaterias offering the best of both countries. Mix in a handful of the most celebrated pastry chefs in the world creating gourmet ice cream and I think Paris might just win the battle. Below is a guide to the Top 10 Ice Cream Parlours in Paris showing you where to find the best ice cream, gelato and sorbet in the city.  It has become bucket-list worthy to try an ice cream from Berthillon, particularly so if visiting in the summer months. The original shop is located on Île St Louis, but there are dozens of glaciers dedicated to famous Berthillon ice cream on the island and elsewhere in the city. Best enjoyed strolling through the cobbled back streets of the idyllic Île St Louis or sitting on the banks of the Seine with an accordionist playing classic French songs in the background. 31 Rue Saint-Louis en l’Île, 75004 Paris  Grom serves the best ice cream outside of Italy. Using the purest ingredients and highest quality milk, the gelato served at Grom is seriously thick and creamy. They offer a vast array of flavours sticking to their Italian roots with options such as Sicilian lemon and ricotta, stracciatella and tiramisu. Expect to spend a long time choosing as every flavour sounds and tastes divine. 81 Rue de Seine, 75006 Paris  The sweet and very popular rue Cler hosts an abundance of great boutiques selling all kinds of French delicacies. You’ll find cheese mongers, fresh fruit and vegetable markets, chocolate boutiques and the wonderful Martine Lambert ice cream parlour. Grab a delicious ice cream and enjoy it whilst taking in all the charms of this pedestrianized street and make your way to the Eiffel Tower and Champ de Mars, a mere five minute walk away. 39 Rue Cler, 75007 Paris  Pozetto is a truly authentic gelateria in Paris serving classic Italian flavours such as hazelnut and pistachio. Located in the heart of the bustling Marais neighbourhood, it’s the perfect accompaniment for exploring the area and wandering its cobbled backstreets and charming squares. 39 Rue du Roi de Sicile, 75004 Paris  Pierre Hermé is renowned for his inventive macaron flavours but he also applies the same level of genius, expertise and innovation to his ice cream creations.  They are only available in the summer months but trust me they are worth waiting for. The divine ice cream is sandwiched together between two meringue shells creating the most delectable hold-in-your-hand ice cream. Favourite flavor combinations include rose, litchi and raspberry and separately passion fruit, orange and cream cheese. 39 Avenue Opéra, 75002 Paris  Amorino may be a chain ice cream parlour, but that’s not to say it’s not worthy of mentioning. The array of flavours are vast, the ice cream is delicious and what’s more they make your ice cream into a pretty and very Instagrammable flower shape. Another bonus is that you can choose up to five flavours no matter how few scoops you have. A favourite of mine is the Speculoos flavor, based on the traditional spiced, short crust biscuit. 4 Rue de Buci, 75006 Paris & various other addresses  During the summer months Ladurée serve their little pots of ice cream. Staying true to their feminine aesthetic, they come in the prettiest pastel green and gold paper cups and are as adorable as they are delicious. On offer are the same variety of flavours as their macarons with classics such as raspberry, blackcurrant, pistachio and salted caramel. 21 Rue Bonaparte, 75006 Paris & various other addresses  Angelina is more famously known for its deathly rich hot chocolate but it also serves everything from traditional French pastries to creamy ice creams and fruity sorbets. Here you’ll find a flavor you won’t find anywhere else in the city, the Mont Blanc, inspired by their most famous pastry combing chestnut with chantilly cream. 226 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris  The éclairs served at l’Éclair de Genie are no secret to sweet tooths in Paris, a testament to which is the perpetual long queue out the door. It was another stroke of genius to create an iced version of this celebrated French pastry and it has become a big success to existing fans and new comers. 14 Rue Pavée, 75004 Paris  Pedone has been creating traditional French ice cream since 1959 and continues to do so with as much passion as when the company first emerged all those decades ago. An ice cream parlour has recently opened inside the department store, Galeries Lafayette, where homemade ice cream is churned right before your very eyes. I would recommend the pure Sicilian pistachio or the grand cru chocolate by Valrhona. Inside Galeries Lafayette 40 Boulevard Haussmann, 75009 Paris Photography by Faye Bullock."
169,"Santorini is one of those bucket list destinations we all dream over. So if you’ve recently taken the plunge and booked your ticket to the beautiful island of Santorini, you’re probably wondering how you should spend your time there. Fear not, we’ve got the complete travel guide to Santorini right here for you! From where to stay, play, shop and eat, this is your best guide to visiting Santorini for the first time. Santorini is the most popular of the Greek Islands. There’s something about the white houses and blue roof tops that travellers just can’t get enough of. The size of the island is just a little larger than Manhattan, with a total population of a little more than 15,000 permanent residents. This of course is a drop in the water compared to the amount of tourists who visit per year, estimated at two million annually. Most of the visitors to Santorini focus their efforts on the developed western part of the island, in search of their next best instagram photo. This is where you will find the impressive display of homes and businesses built into the cliffside, offering endless explorations on foot. Oia is Santorini’s crowning jewel. This is where you will find the iconic white houses and blue rooftops. And trust us – it lives up to the hype. There are a few ways you can arrive in Santorini. The most popular is to fly into Athens and catch a public ferry to the island from there. If you have the budget and want to do something special, you could also choose to sail across in a catamaran yourself. Alternatively, you can fly into the island’s airport: Thira National Airport. Surprisingly this is quite easy and affordable with Easyjet flying from Gatwick and Manchester airports. British Airways operates flights to Thira Airport from London Heathrow. Aside from the obvious (sipping cocktails by the pool and enjoying pastel-coloured sunsets), there are plenty of activities on offer on the island of Santorini. But don’t underestimate the pleasure to be had in the art of vacationing. This is the kind of island where you really can arrive, switch off, and unwind. Santorini is known for its crisp white wines and dessert wine known as Vinsanto. There are a handful of wineries who offer wine tasting and food for a small fee. This can be a great way to get out of your hotel and explore more of the island. There are a few day tours on offer for visitors to Santorini, especially if you are interested in archaeology. The most popular day tour visits caldera’s volcanic islands of Nea Kameni and Palia Kameni. You will visit the crater of one of the volcanoes, and the hot springs of the other. For the adventurous among us, there is an opportunity to rent a quad bike and explore the island at leisure. ATVs are a great way to get around the island and see more of what it has to offer, outside the commercial developments of Oia. Still looking for more from the Greek Islands?

170,"Indeed, Paris is best discovered on foot, without plans or regard for time. These are the most beautiful hidden locations in Paris, from impressive interiors to hidden courtyards and everything in between. To quote Julien Greene: Paris . . . is loath to surrender itself to people who are in a hurry; it belongs to the dreamers, to those capable of amusing themselves in its streets without regard to time when urgent business requires their presence elsewhere.  Located in my absolute favourite part of town, Île de la Cité, this gothic style chapel does not disappoint. I had been travelling to Paris for 8 years before I discovered it, due mostly to the fact that it was closed for restoration for seven years, reopening in 2015. The very first trip I made to Paris after the re-opening, I made a point of visiting and seeing what I had missed all these years: an endless stream of colours just as beautiful as I had imagined.  Montmartre was the first neighbourhood I stayed in Paris, so it holds a special place in my heart. The popular artist’s neighbourhood has long been undergoing gentrification as with the rest of Paris, but it is the neighbourhood that still retains its bohemian roots, right down to its core. One of my favourite postcard-worthy photos is atop the hill out the front of Le Consulat – best found by meandering through the alleyways and stumbling upon it (leave your data switched off and discover Paris by mistake!)  Every year for the past five years I have been making an annual trip to Paris in Spring. Not only is it my favourite season visually (uh, cherry blossoms, hello!!!), but it is also my preferred time of year to skip the summer crowds but also not be bogged down in grey skies through the colder months. On last year’s annual pilgrimage to Paris, I made an effort of seeking out all of Paris’ hidden passages. My favourite was Galerie Vivienne – a tired but still somewhat charismatic shopping passage that time seems to have left behind. Read more: The Secret Passages of Paris  A blogger’s favourite, Palais Royal has long been the subject of the infamous Paris Instagram shot. The recognisable black and white columns are hidden from the main thoroughfare, inside a gloriously large courtyard.  The Luxembourg Gardens are my personal favourite location to pass time in the Spring sunshine, not only for the beauty of the gardens but also for the display of people watching (it never ceases to amaze me how much time I can pass doing just that). Located in a quiet corner of the gardens in the Marie De Medicis Fountain, shaded by the trees with sun stars playfully peeking through.  Over in Le Marais is one of my favourite hotels: Pavillon De La Reine. Located right by Place des Vosges (only the prettiest park in all of Paris), this property is in an unbeatable location and even if you can’t afford a night here, be sure to sneak in to the coutryard for a look at the leafy exterior.  This fancy hotel nearby the Arc De Triomphe is as beautiful in real life as it looks in photos. Though I didn’t stay here, I did have a friend who snuck me up to their balcony for a view of the tower (who could say no to that!?) and spent the afternoon enjoying high tea with a view of the coutryard (which looks way more impressive in full bloom). If you want a squiz, walk confidently past the doorman and you’ll almost immediately stumble upon the coutryard. Read more: Where to find the best views of Paris  Just a short walk from Notre Dame Cathedral is this hidden beauty: Au Vieux. The interior isn’t much to look at, so I’d suggest pulling up a chair outside and ordering a coffee from the owners, who are usually there with their cat roaming around the tables eager for a free feed from a friendly tourist.  Located in my favourite neighbourhood in Paris to stay is my favourite park in Paris: Place des Vosges. This beautiful park is not exactly “hidden” as such, but it is a local hotspot and located off the tourist path. Best enjoyed on a Sunday afternoon with a picnic, bottle of vino and some new friends. Be sure to pop in to “Carette” while you’re here: they have the best salted caramel macarons in town (and believe me when I say I have tried them all).  Visitors to Notre Dame can be forgiven for doing the quick “we came, we conquered” routine, as the crowds can be a little overwhelming. However, if you take the time to walk around the cathedral and view it from behind, you’ll be rewarded with a beautiful Spring garden that is one of the most colourful in the city of Paris. The chairs in the garden are rarely if ever full, so be sure to pack a book if you’re on your own and take some time out from walking the city streets.  I quite literally stumbled upon the Latin Quarter 6 years ago when I was in search of vintage boutiques in Saint Germain. Before I knew it, one thing led to another and I was in the middle of a cheap eats hot spot, hungry, broke, and eating a cheap falafel sandwich from Maoz like it was my last supper. This area is best enjoyed in the early evening, as the food vendors make their way to the front of their stores to entice prospective customers inside (not in a horrible way – this is France, they manage to make it charming).  Located in the 16th arrondisement, this cul de sac is an instagrammer’s favourite for its view of the Eiffel Tower, surrounded by posh apartments in this affluent neighbourhood. If you ask me this is one of the best views of the tower in all of Paris. Read more: 20 Most Instagrammable Locations in Paris  The best view of Paris is an argument I don’t think will ever be solved, but if you were to ask me, I’d say it is atop the Arc de Triomphe. Although not hidden, this location is so often overlooked by tourists (who come to take a photo OF the monument rather than ON TOP of it), that I knew it had to be included in this list.  The Louvre is a far cry from hidden, but you’d be surprised how very few people visit the museum without appreciating the building itself. Take a look at the ceilings!  You’ll be forgiven for thinking the days of “secrets” in Paris are over with the age of the internet, but I promise you this one is a complete local’s hidden gem. Located in Le Marais, this patisserie looks as if it has been plucked out of another century and the tiredness of it would nearly lead one to conclude this is true. But what it lacks in spruce, it makes up for in the quality of pastries and a wide selection if I do say so myself! As a concept store enthusiast, I never tire of stumbling upon quirky shops filled with all the things I do not need but so happen to buy anyhow. You might have already heard about Colette (now closed), but I promise you that Merci is way, WAY, better. Another of my favourite finds on the hidden passages of Paris haunt is Passage Jouffrey. This 1863 arcade is a walk through time with its tiled floors and glass roof that brings the entire space to life. Amongst the many boutiques you will find old books, canes, custom paper specialists and so many more quirks. I’ve mentioned it once or twice in this article, but I promise you, you will not be disappointed with a visit to The Marais! This neighbourhood is best enjoyed on foot or by bicycle, meandering through the many streets that are lined with small boutiques – a far cry from the likes of the Champs Elysees or Rue Saint Honore. Another secret passage that I stumbled upon was Galerie Vero-Dodat… without even meaning to! This passage was so secret that I hadn’t even heard of it, but was immediately intrigued as I passed the entrance. Hidden in plain sight is how I would describe my absolute favourite bridge in Paris: Pont Alexandre III. This is my favourite area to wander around at sunset or BYO a bottle of vino, some stinky cheese, and watch the world pass by in the late afternoon. My job allows me to see some pretty swanky places, particularly when it comes to the world’s most beautiful hotels. When I first check in to a hotel I almost always find the staircase, because I try to take the stairs when travelling in a half-arsed effort to ‘exercise’. The staircases in Parisian five-star hotels are something else! Atop the hill in Montmartre is the old artists quarter, a charming part of this bohemian neighbourhood that is part fabulous, part tourist trap (and unfortunately more the latter). However if you can avoid the nagging “artists” with their offers to draw you (poorly, mostly), then this is a really lovely area to explore. This beautiful street in Montmartre is one of my favourite spots in all of Paris. The stairs will take you all the way to Sacre-Couer Basilica and all the glories that lay in upper-Montmartre. Although technically outside of Paris, this list would not be complete without mention of Paris’ extended family: Versailles. The Queen’s gardens are a highlight worth seeing, though have bizarre opening hours and seasonal restrictions, so be sure to check before you visit! If you’re an Amelie fan (like me!) then you can’t pass up the chance to visit Canal Saint-Martin and wander the tree-lined canals. If you’re a fan of Art Nouveu, then Paris is a museum of hidden gems waiting to be discovered. One of my favourites is #22 Avenue Rapp. Read more: A Guide to Art Nouveu in Paris If you can withstand the 387 stairs to the top, the views from the Notre Dame Cathedral are some of the most impressive in the entire city. Be sure to arrive at least 30 minutes prior to opening time if you don’t enjoy lines (and waiting for hours, mind you!) My inclusion of Paris’ passages wouldn’t be complete without Passage des Panoramas, located just opposite Passage Jouffrey. This quirky passage has its own train-modeled restaurant and is perhaps the most quirky of them all. If pretty Paris streets are your goal, then look no further than this little gem! Here you will find one of the best “street views” of the eiffel tower in the background and typical Parisian street life in the foreground. Read more: The 12 Prettiest Streets in Paris If you’re a sucker for reading books prior to your arrival in a new city, then you absolutely must read “The Only Street in Paris” before arriving at Rue des Martyrs. This beautiful street is everything Paris used to be: filled with artisans, specialty cheese shops… you name it. If there’s one location I should keep a secret, this is it. Be prepared to experience the Paris you thought time had forgot. The WOW Guide to Paris"
171,"I knew it would be a fairytale evening the moment I walked through the impressive glass doors of the Pulitzer Hotel in Amsterdam. On previous visits to the city I had kept my accommodation low key and more towards the budget side, so I was eager to check in to this ultra luxe hotel in the canals district of Amsterdam, for a night I will surely never forget. Amsterdam is a romantic city in every sense of the word. While it doesn’t compare to Paris, this city built on canals has a complete magic of its own. I arrived in Amsterdam in the late morning, catching the train to the city for convenience. From there I made my way to the Pulitzer Hotel; my home for the evening. While I knew it would be too early to check in, I dropped my bags with the porter and pledged to return later in the afternoon, leaving plenty of time to freshen up before my later afternoon boat ride on the hotels’ house boat aptly named The Tourist. My first impressions were that I should have booked a second night, for this would be one hotel stay I would never dream of forgetting. The Pulitzer is the quintessential experience one imagines when arriving in Amsterdam: looking out over the canals at dusk, sipping a glass of whatever is on offer, opening the window and soaking in the atmosphere of one of Europe’s finest cities.  The minute I checked in to my room I had flashbacks of some of my favourite hotel experiences the world over. Grungy like downtown Manhattan, the hotel has an effortless appeal with playful splashes of mustard and deep purples, giving it an art deco feel. My room was located at the back of the hotel, giving me an absolutely perfect view of the canals out my window (which open 1/3 of the way). The bedding is plush, cozy, and allowed me to kick jetlag in one night of uninterrupted sleep. All of the mod cons are featured – cable television, light control from the bed, and everything one would expect from such a swish establishment. On arrival I was greeted by stroopwaffles (a packet of which is replenished throughout your stay!!!) and some macarons (salted caramel, no less!)  As the hotel occupies a huge number of canal houses (all interconnected), I made it my business to explore the hotel at great length. For a fancy evening meal the hotel has Jansz, which is also where you can enjoy breakfast. As someone who likes to keep it casual when travelling (unless its a special occasion), I grabbed a light bite from Pause, the hotel’s casual restaurant that is mostly popular during the day time when many locals frequent the hotel’s public spaces. The Pulitzer breakfast was a force to be reckoned with. From croissants as good as those to be found in Paris through to fancy eggs on brioche (yummmm), there was no way I would be needing lunch that day.  Before flying out for Europe I made it my business to research each and every inch of what the hotel has to offer. After all, this was a once in a lifetime kind of deal! I was excited to read that the hotel offered boat tours on the canals of Amsterdam, all from the comfort of their beautiful house boat. It didn’t take more than two photos to convince me I must make this a part of my stay, so I booked my magical afternoon for the day I arrived in the city. The house boat tour takes place on “The Tourist” and lasts around 75 minutes. From the iconic canal houses you will make your way out to the outskirts of Amsterdam, all the while being given a detailed account of the city and its history. If it weren’t for this boat and our captain, I wouldn’t have learned fun facts like the canal house “hooks”, used to lift furniture in to the higher levels of the houses.  If you’re reading about it here on my blog, you know its good! The Pulitzer was a once-in-a-lifetime kinda hotel stay. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who has an appreciation for interior design, who feels like they should have been born in New York during the art deco age, or who just loves a good canal house view to wake up to. This was an absolutely faultless stay and if you’re looking for a night of modern luxury, this is where to find it in Amsterdam!  A huge thank you to the Pulitzer Hotel for welcoming me to Amsterdam! All photos + opinions of my stay are my own."
172,"I would be kidding if I said Portugal isn’t one of my favourite destinations in Europe. Great food, great people, incredible coast lines… there really isn’t anything I don’t love about this country! After a few visits to Portugal over the past few years, I’ve found some standout favourites to encourage you to get there on your next Euro adventure… so here they are! The 8 places you must visit in Portugal!  Starting in Lisbon is not only the most convenient way to get going with your visit to Portugal, but also a great insight into what this country and its people are all about. My favourite neighbourhood is hands down Alfama, my favourite restaurant is Mini Bar and my favourite food is the traditional Portuguese tart. Try all three and I promise you, you won’t have a bad time! Read more: A Quick Guide to Lisbon Just a short drive from Portugal’s capital is the gorgeous, charming little town known as Sintra. The buildings are playfully colourful and the small cafe-lined streets are a great excuse to people-watch. I could have spent an entire day here meandering the sloped alleyways! Read more: Visiting Sintra & Cascais as a day trip from Lisbon If you ask me Lagos is where you will find the most impressive beaches in Portugal. The colourful red rock cliff faces, the secluded beaches and the never-ending year round sunshine make this one of my all time destinations in the Mediterranean! If you’re looking for somewhere to stay, I checked in for a girls weekend at the Villa Vita Parc and it was one of my favourite holidays of all time! Read more: A Guide to the Algarve: Portugal’s most loved holiday destination One of the most popular places just outside of Lisbon and an absolute must visit (let me make sure I don’t overstate this —- MAKE SURE YOU GO!) is Pastéis de Belém – home to the famous Portuguese Tarts. The tarts have a warm eggy centre due to the constant output and never ending line of tourists and locals waiting to get their hands on a bagful. Make your own at home! Pastel de Nata Recipe  If you hire a car for your time in Portugal and want a beautiful region to discover, check out the Douro Valley in the North of Portugal. The landscape are absolutely stunning but as always in Portugal, the food and wine are just as mesmerising! If you make your way to Sintra (which I highly suggest you do), you absolutely cannot miss Pena Palace, located high on the hill overlooking the surrounding region. The colourful castle is one of Europe’s most beautiful – the photo is proof! Outside of Lisbon, Porto is one of the most popular cities to visit in Portugal. With a medieval past and incredibly authentic riverside, this is without a doubt one of the most gorgeous cities in Western Europe to discover.  Located on the West Coast of Portugal is this gorgeous, quintessential coastal town that surprisingly is little-known. Expect canals filled with colourful boats, intricate architecture and extremely welcoming locals. If you’re looking for a hidden gem to discover, this is it."
173,"While in Amsterdam this past week I had one major dilemma to face: how to buy more books without my boyfriend noticing. I’ve been on a “book ban” for a while now, with so many books back in Australia that it will likely take me 10 trips home before I bring them all over to South Africa (more on that – why I moved to South Africa). Somehow I managed to sneak in a couple of “essential purchases” from this trip and here is where I found them: at the best bookstores in Amsterdam. Mendo is the kind of bookstore you don’t seek out, but rather stumble upon. The window displays are enough to lure you in but the books inside the store are impossible to walk away from. It is here where I purchased the Monocle Guide to Good Business, a guidebook for small businesses that I have been dying to read since its release. Open 7 days, 10:30-18:00, ’till 17:00 on Sunday Address: Berenstraat 11, 1016 GG Amsterdam, Netherlands Looking for any and every English book under the sun? Look no further than the American Book Centre. This is hands down the most frequented book store in Amsterdam solely selling English books and best of all, it is smack bang in the centre of town. Open 7 days, 10:00-20:00, 11:00-18:30 on Sunday, 12:00-20:00 on Monday Address: Spui 12, 1012 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands This is my favourite book store in Amsterdam and that is solely because they stock my book (ha!) I published World of Wanderlust back in 2016 and a year later it was picked up by a Dutch publisher to be translated. This is where I had my book signing and on every subsequent visit to Amsterdam, I pop in for a visit. Open 7 days, 10:00-19:00, 11:00-18:00 on Sunday Address: Spui 14-16, 1012 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands Right next door to the book store is the subsequent magazine store for Athenaeum Boekhandel. This is the most comprehensive selection of English magazines, shipped in from around the world on a regular basis. If I ever start a travel magazine, I’d be dying to stock it here! Open 7 days, 10:00-19:00, 11:00-18:00 on Sunday Address: Spui 14-16, 1012 XA Amsterdam, Netherlands If you’re in the market for a cheap find or just prefer to purchase second hand, pop by the Used English Books store. There’s a huge and ever-changing selection and the staff are really helpful. Open 7 days, 10:00-18:00, 11:30-16:00 on Sunday Address: Kloveniersburgwal 58, 1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands I stumbled upon this final bookstore by chance and I’ve got to say it is one of the most gorgeous stores I have seen the world over! The owner is friendly and welcoming, proud of his collection of antique books. Definitely worth a visit. Open Mon-Sat, 10:00-17:00, 11:00-17:00 on Saturday Address: Singel 319, 1012 WJ Amsterdam, Netherlands"
174,"Of all the destinations on my map for my first visit to Norway, Bergen was the one I was most excited for. Having seen oodles of colourful photographs of what looks like a small coastal town (but is actually the second largest city in Norway), I was convinced this was reason enough to travel so far North (around 30 hours of flying and transit from Australia). Once here, I had just one day in Bergen to explore all this city has to offer – from incredible views to one of the most picturesque harbours, here is everything you must see and do in Bergen!  The historical harbour of Bryggen (translation: North side of the bay) is as pretty as a postcard and indeed, one of the main drawcards for tourism to Norway’s coastal cities and towns. The wooden houses that line the harbour today were actually rebuilt following a devastating fire in 1702, however are considered to be like those used as far back as 1350, when this area was created for trade purposes.  Step behind the pretty facades and make your way through the small alleyways of Bryggen to get a feel for what this area would have been like during the Middle Ages. If you chance a visit before the crowds arrive (before 9:00am), you will have a great opportunity to experience what life must have been like centuries ago.  Here in Bryggen you will also find many souvenir shops, local handicrafts and art galleries. One of my favourite finds was Julehuset, a year-round Christmas shop on the upper levels of the first building along the strip. This is a great little shop to visit if you’re after a cute little trinket to take home that will actually get more use (ahem, as opposed to say, a fridge magnet!!!)  One of the best pieces of advice I received on the day was from a local man who pointed us in the direction of the residential streets behind Bryggen (away from the water), which were filled with wooden houses in their traditional state. These streets were full of charm at every turn and it was a great way to spend an hour or so soaking up local life (plus, everyone was super friendly!)  As we arrived in town on a Sunday morning, we had the chance to wander through fresh, local produce as we inspected the offerings at the harbour market. While seafood was the primary offering, there was also a great selection of fresh berries (how delicious do these look!?) and even a smoothie bar.  I visited Bergen on the Norwegian Fjords cruise with Celebrity Cruises. This cruise runs twice per year and if you’re after the sunshine, I’d suggest taking the August cruise at the end of summer! "
175,"I don’t think there’s a city in all of Europe with as much charisma and character as Barcelona; this city is full of it! I recently spent a few nights in the city to explore by day and feast all night, with my local friend David to point me in the direction of Barcelona’s best places to eat, drink, and the must-visit city sights. Here’s a complete guide to help you make the most of your four days in Barcelona!  On each of my visits to Barcelona, I’ve checked in to the Mandarin Oriental, one of my favourite properties in the collection for so many reasons. The location is bang in the centre of town and in just a few minutes you can reach Gaudi architecture, great cafes and restaurants, and are dead in the centre of the shopping district. The hotel itself is a tribute to modern Barcelona, with impressive interiors and one of the cities’ most celebrated restaurants. On this visit I also discovered the hotel’s rooftop bar and casual restaurant, where I spent a few evenings enjoying cocktails and sunset views (even if you’re not staying at the hotel you can enjoy the view with a vino or sangria!) Mandarin Oriental | Passeig de Gràcia, 38-40, 08007 Barcelona  Still one of my favourite destinations in the city despite the crowds, La Boqueria is a must-visit in Barcelona. The prices are a little higher than you’ll pay at your local market, but the fruit is fresh, the people are friendly and the vibe is infectious! La Boqueria | La Rambla, 91, 08001 Barcelona  One of the biggest draw cards for me for any city is the food scene and boy does Barcelona come through with the goodies! There’s one thing on my mind when I’m in Barcelona and its tapas. Here’s where to go for the best tapas in Barcelona: Bar Tomas – A little out of the city in the hood is Bar Tomas, said to be home to the best patatas bravas in all of Barcelona. If you’re a serious foodie or up for a mission, you won’t be disappointed! Bar Cañete – Probably the most famous tapas bar in town, you can expect to be surrounded by tourists if you arrive before 10:00pm. However if you come at Spanish dinner time (10pm onwards), you’ll find that this place is just as popular among the locals. El Nacionale – Although overpriced and overly popular, you can’t skip out on my favourite eatery in town: El Nacionale. This is one of the most beautiful spaces to dine in, has a great range of tapas and is a fun place to start the evening. El Born – Not a place but a neighbourhood, you should spend at least one night bar hopping in El Born, the most happening little neighbourhood any night of the week.  Back at our hotel, we spent almost every evening atop the Mandarin Oriental taking in the panoramic views from the rooftop bar and pool area. This is a great way to enjoy the luxury of one of Barcelona’s best hotels without the price tag of a room for the night, as it is truly a destination not to be missed! Passeig de Gràcia, 38-40, 08007 Barcelona, Spain  Any visitor to Barcelona will have Park Güell on their list of sights to visit, but the best-kept secret is to visit first thing in the morning when the park opens and to book your ticket in advance! This is the best way to beat the crowds and capture the morning light. Park Güell | 08024 Barcelona  Another must on any traveller’s list of sights to see in Barcelona is the Hogwarts-esque church, Sagrada Familia. The unfinished masterpiece is another of Gaudi’s works and must be seen to be believed. Sagrada Familia | Carrer de Mallorca, 401, 08013 Barcelona  As my personal favourite of Gaudi’s masterpieces, Casa Batllo houses one of the most beautiful facades in all of Europe. Passeig de Gràcia, 43, 08007 Barcelona, Spain    On our last day in Barcelona we made our way out of the city for an adventurous outing to the top of Montserrat. There is a cable car or train to reach the top, which showcases impressive views of Catalonia. The train is the best and cheapest way to arrive in Montserrat and is really easy to navigate from the city. I travelled from to Europe with Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong. This has been my preferred route for a few years now and gives me another excuse to stopover in HK, one of my favourite cities for a short stopover. Thanks to Cathay for including me in the #lifewelltravelled campaign."
176," This pretty in pink tea room is the epitome of femininity. The interior is heavily decorated in pastel pink and gold with a beautiful chandelier and plush arm chairs. There is a wide selection of tea flavours on offer but their signature one is the Marie-Antoinette made from apples and roses picked directly from the King‘s Kitchen Garden of Versailles which goes very nicely with a slice of their apple cake. 29 Rue Danielle Casanova, 75001 Paris, France  The tea room for ladies who lunch or in this case, ladies who take tea. Order a plate of candy-coloured macarons and pastel hued pastries to create a tailor made tea party that every girl dreams of. Choose amongst flavours such as almond, rose or Darjeeling or the popular Marie Antoinette flavour, a gentle melange of rose petals, citrus fruit and honey which is delicately perfumed, light and refreshing. The beautifully wrapped boxes of loose leaf tea and muslin tea bags also make for a unique and special souvenir of your trip. Av. des Champs-Élysées, 75008 Paris, France  Le Meurice puts on a spread as good as any afternoon tea you’ll find in London. Here you’ll find a British-inspired affair including finger sandwiches, scones with jam and clotted cream and a selection of petit fours. Dine in the beautifully ornate Dalí restaurant which offers stunning surroundings for an afternoon tea experience. €48 per person. 226 Rue de Rivoli, 75001  An afternoon tea setting that consists solely of sweet eats? Yes please! The afternoon tea at Hôtel Plaza Athénée is in true Parisian fashion – straight to good stuff with 3 full tiers of sweet treats. There are no scones or sandwiches, just a delicious plating of all the sugary goodness you could ever consumer in one sitting. 25 Avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris  Afternoon tea at the Hotel Bristol is a very civilized affair. Three tiered plates arrive delicately placed with miniature club sandwiches and traditional French pastries, featuring many creations by the pastry chef of the year. You can take tea inside the ornate tea lounge, or alternatively in the beautiful courtyard garden. €80 for two people. (Photo via Hotel Bristol) 112 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, 75008 Paris  Hotel Costes is famously known by Parisians as the purveyor of the most beautiful roses in Paris. But behind the infamous florist lies the hotel with its acclaimed restaurant, bar and courtyard. Almost perpetually full of chic Parisians, it has become the place to sip and be seen. Nothing really beats taking tea in the plant covered courtyard with its grandiose statues and salmon hued walls reminiscent of an Italian piazza. 239-241 Rue Saint Honoré, 75001 Paris "
177,"Nothing beats a panoramic view of a city, especially one as beautiful as Paris. Seeing a city from above allows you to immediately gain perspective and get your bearings, as well as be inspired by the beautiful cityscape. Fortunately in Paris, you can climb most of the famous monuments and the best thing is that each of them offer an entirely different vantage point. Thus, we’ve listed the most iconic monuments, rooftop terraces and restaurants to help you find the best views in Paris.  If spectacular views of the Eiffel Tower are what you’re after, then this is where you must go. This 5* luxury hotel opens its terrace to the public between the hours of 4pm to 11.30pm during the summer, giving you access to one of the absolute best views in Paris without the per-night price tag. Do be prepared to dig deep into your pockets for drinks, however the view makes the pricy cocktails worth every penny. (Photo via Shangri-La)  Standing at the top of the Arc de Triomphe offers a spectacular view of Paris. The twelve avenues stretch out from the roundabout below offering a dizzying view of the city and a birds eye view of the most famous avenue in Paris: the Champs Elysées.  But the real reason this view is so good? It offers an unparalleled panorama of the Eiffel Tower which stands proudly above the Parisian rooftops. The chic and trendy restaurant Maison Blanche is located on the exclusive Avenue Montaigne, one of the most expensive shopping streets in Paris. The restaurant is as exclusive as the road it lies on, reservations are needed but if you nab a table you won’t be disappointed. The all-white restaurant has large glass panels and an outdoor terrace with views towards the Eiffel Tower and the Champs-Elysée. On Saturdays the upper floor turns into a nightclub for those who want to party with a view over the Paris skyline. (Photo via Maison Blanche)  It is said that the best view over Paris is from atop the Montparnasse tower, the reason being that when you’re at the top you can’t see the modern monstrosity of the building itself. The second reason being that it offers one of the best views of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the kind of shot you see on postcards. It also boasts the fastest lift in Europe so an additional bonus is not having to climb hundreds of stairs to appreciate the views but instead reaching the 56th floor in 38 seconds! (Photo via Where Kate Resides) This luxury hotel located in Montmartre opens its terrace as a restaurant for lunch and dinner. The verdant and leafy terrace provides the most romantic setting for dinner, only heightened by the breathtaking view over the city of lights with the Eiffel Tower in the distance. (Photo via Hotel Terass”)  Everyone loves a good rooftop bar. What’s not to love about enjoying a chilled glass of rosé or an expertly crafted cocktail whilst taking in a spectacular view? Paris doesn’t have very many rooftop bars like hip and happening New York does, so Parisians flock in large numbers to the select few rooftop bars in the city. Le Perchoir is one of the trendiest in Paris attracting long queues but offering killer views to boot. (Photo via Where Kate Resides) As one of Paris’ most iconic hotels, you really can’t get a better room view than those on offer at the Plaza Athénée. The entire facade of the hotel is covered in lush greenery and red flowers, making this an even more magical sight with the glorious Eiffel Tower as a backdrop!  Similar to roof top bars, hotel terraces are a wonderful way to view Paris from above. It tends to be the higher end hotels that house the most impressive roof top terraces, with views spanning over the whole city. Hotel Raphael offers one of the best terraces as it is situated in equal distance between the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe; therefore boasts astounding views of both of these iconic monuments.  The view from atop the Sacré Cœur basilica seems to be the least well known of all the monuments. Not many people realise you can climb stairs to the top of the dome roof, but rest assured you can. The basilica is perched on one of Paris’ highest peaks so climbing a further 300 steps to the top of the basilica offers unparalleled views over Paris.  The Buttes Chaumont park is located on one of Paris’ highest peaks therefore offers a pretty spectacular panorama over the whole city. Many flock here for the park itself replete with cascading waterfalls and pony rides for children and others for the views over Paris that they can enjoy whilst picnicking on the expanse of green.  Some of the best views in Paris can be found from apartment windows, especially if the apartment is on one of the upper floors. Every time you go to one of your friends’ apartments in the city, make sure to take a look out their windows and I bet you’ll see some pretty phenomenal views. The above photo was taken from my friend’s place who lives on the 7th floor in the 16th neighbourhood.  Climbing the worn stairs of the gothic Notre Dame cathedral built in 1163 is somewhat surreal. The higher you get, the more precarious it feels, but fear not, for it is very safe. The view from the top spans the river Seine and all of Paris’ left bank. Queues form very quickly so I would recommend arriving earlier rather than later.  Two of the biggest department stores in Paris, Lafayette and Printemps, offer terraces with beautiful views over Paris. The best part is that climbing to the top of them is entirely free. You come face to face with magnificent Opéra Garnier and get a real sense of the buzz of the city below. Literally translated as Paris’ sky, this dizzyingly high restaurant and bar offers a specular view of the Paris skyline, as its name implies. Located on the 56th floor of the Montparnasse tower, the Ciel de Paris doesn’t only house a gourmet restaurant but also a chic champagne bar. (Photo via Ciel de Paris)  Café Richelieu is located in the Richelieu wing of the Louvre and has an outdoor terrace with a birds eye view of the Louvre, the Pyramid and the Napoleon courtyard. The food isn’t the best, but it is ideal for photos of this world famous museum without any tourists in front of the lens. (Photo via Café Richelieu)"
178,"Although is low season, my favourite time of year to be in Amsterdam is during winter. There’s something so cozy and inviting about this city in the winter months but best of all, there are hardly any crowds. Amsterdam has become so popular that during the summer time, it is difficult to get through the streets without huge lines to museums, crowds in the 9 streets and disgruntled locals (which I can understand). So if you’re looking for a guide to visiting Amsterdam in winter, here you are! This is my third time visiting Amsterdam in the colder months and I’m still just as besotted with the city as I was the first time I visited. If you’re planning your trip and wondering what to pack, look no further. Because Amsterdam is so Northern, it does get quite cold in winter. Here’s a snapshot of what I packed for a few days in Amsterdam this winter:  The first item you need to be armed with is a sweater or a thick knit. As soon as I landed I dropped in to some stores to purchase a few in white, beige and black. These didn’t come off for my entire trip! You’ll also need a coat that is preferably long to shield your legs from the wind. On your feet I’d recommend boots, which will also act to keep your legs warm. My latest obsessions are these Steve Madden over-knees and the Common Project Combat Boots. I’d also recommend packing a scarf, some good quality gloves and some sneakers if you plan to walk around the city. If you’re visiting Amsterdam in winter the trick is to work with what you’ve got. Make the most of the coziness and winter and embrace the best things to do when it is cold in Amsterdam. Start at the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam’s most famous museum both for its architecture and collection. Once you’ve warmed up inside (be sure you don’t miss the library), head outside to enjoy the ice skating. During winter the ice skating is open 10am-9pm. Address: Museumplein 5, 1071 DJ Amsterdam, Netherlands Next make your way over to the 9 streets: Amsterdam’s famous shopping area. It is here where you can spend hours popping in and out of small boutiques, quaint cafes and beautiful art galleries showing local artists. Although it is cold in Amsterdam in winter, walking is still the best way to get around. Especially in the mornings at sunrise (around 9am) and of the evenings at 5pm when locals are starting and finishing work, walking is the best option. This is because everyone cycles to work and school, so unless you’re really confident on a bike I would save bike riding for the middle of the day. Renting a bike is essential in Amsterdam, no matter what time of year you visit. It’s the easiest and cheapest way to get around the city and you’ll find lots of places to rent a bike from. Be sure to lock up your bike or it might not be there when you get back! I loved the MOCA Museum so much that I thought it deserved its own dedicated mention. This museum is full of contemporary, modern and street art by really famous artists like Andy Warhol and Banksy. The displays are really interactive and for street art especially, I left with a newfound appreciation. Open 7 days, 9:00-19:00, ’til 20:00 Fridays and Saturdays Address: Honthorststraat 20, 1071 DE Amsterdam, Netherlands My first recommendation would be the Pulitzer Hotel as it is located on the fringe of the 9 streets and therefore in one of the prettiest parts of town. The hotel itself is housed in old traditional canal houses, so it is a maze to wander around and feels very local. Book through Pulitzer Amsterdam My second recommendation is located within the 9 streets and is very similar to the Pulitzer Hotel but less pricey. If you can afford the upgrade, be sure to opt for a canal facing room as the views are priceless! Book through Andaz Amsterdam The best part about visiting Amsterdam in winter is to do as the locals do: stay cozy but still go outdoors. If you’re visiting Amsterdam for the first time however, you may wish to try a few of the hot spots as follows. It was only on my third visit to Amsterdam that I went to the Red Light District because on previous visits I had been traveling solo. Although it isn’t really my cup of tea, it is cool to see and I found the experience quite liberating. It is a lot classier and less grungy than I thought it would be. I visited the Van Gogh Museum on my first visit to Amsterdam and loved seeing the collection in the flesh. I’d highly recommend a visit for art lovers (or people who would like to be). Open 7 days, 09:00-17:00 Address: Museumplein 6, 1071 DJ Amsterdam, Netherlands A final mention would be to visit the Anne Frank House. Although you will have to spend hours in line, this is an absolute must do in Amsterdam. It is one of the most surreal and touching experiences for a museum and will give you a really strong appreciation for the hardships endured by Jewish families during the reign of Nazi Germany. Open 7 days, 09:00 – 19:00, ’till 22:00 on Saturdays Address: Westermarkt 20, 1016 GV Amsterdam, Netherlands"
179,"If I could pick just one place in Tuscany that left me speechless, it would be the quaint, charming and incredibly unassuming little town of San Gimignano. Preserved so well that it makes you feel as if you have stepped through a time machine, this town is bursting with character and some of the friendliest locals you will encounter on your travels through Italy (though in fairness, most Italians are full of character!) To make the most of your time here, be sure to follow this quick guide to San Gimignano!  Located southwest of Florence, this small Tuscan town on a hilltop can be reached in an hour by road, making it the perfect day trip from Florence. The town has managed to retain its medieval charm and is so well-kept that you’ll be forgiven for thinking you’ve taken a stroll back in time! Aside from the gorgeousness, you’ll also find some of the world’s best gelato here (quite literally – be sure to read below!), very friendly locals, and some of the best views in all of Tuscany from the many towers. The town itself is very small, making walking the best way to get around. It is by walking that you will also discover the charm of the small cafes and boutiques, with plenty of wine tasting on offer throughout the streets! Although relatively small in size (both geographically and by population), San Gamignano has a range of things to see and do to warrant a half day visit; more if you want to immerse yourself in the lively night scene and book an overnight stay. Whilst most of these attractions you will stumble upon just by walking the narrow streets, this list will help you ensure you check off all the must see sites before taking time to wander at leisure, popping in to small wine tastings and boutiques as you pass the afternoon by. As the main square of San Gimignano, it is nearly impossible to come here and not stumble upon it – making for a great central starting point. Surrounding the square are thousands-of-years-old towers, so be sure to set aside a few euros to climb the stairs of one and take in those mesmerising views of the rolling hills and terracotta roofs. The most popular tower to climb (and the tallest) is the Torre Grossa, priced at a reasonable 5 euros for entry. The entrance fee includes a visit to Pinacoteca Civica, a small but worthwhile painting gallery. If you chance your visit to coincide with market day (Thursdays), you will find yourself amidst a colourful and lively atmosphere with a chance to sample local fruits and delicacies as you wander from one store to the next. The market is held in Piazza del Duomo, the cities main square. But most importantly of all: task yourself with simply wandering the streets, meandering in and out of small alleyways off the main shopping streets and discovering the picturesque beauty of this small Tuscan town.  There’s a reason so many visitors flock to San Gimignano beyond the postcard prettiness, and it comes in the form of the world’s best gelato (yes, it was actually awarded such a title). The owner, Sergio, is a master of gelato and has twice one the sought-after title of Gelato Champione, and believe me when I say the flavours are life-changing. I had the pleasure of meeting Sergio and discovering his two prized flavours: Crema di Santa Fina (cream with saffron and pine nuts) and Raspberry & Rosemary sorbet. Despite the unusual flavour combinations, let me tell you these are two choices you will not regret (especially when eaten together – in the aforementioned order!!!) As far as great wines go, you’ll find some of the best here in San Gamignano and surrounds. Nearby Poggio Winery is a great choice for the flavours of Tuscany. Be sure to try the local Pecorino cheese and don’t be afraid to try a few (you’ll walk it off one way or another!) If you’re touring around Tuscany with the comfort of a hire car, you might want to consider a visit to nearby La Roccaia Winery, a short drive outside of town and offering fantastic local wines.  Siena Florence Volterra Monteriggioni   Highlights of Italy – Where to visit in Tuscany You can’t go to Florence & not see these 20 attractions A Quick Guide to Pisa A Quick Guide to Siena I flew to Tuscany on a direct route with Qatar Airways. Flying from Australia, this meant just two flights to reach the Tuscan region: Melbourne – Doha & Doha – Pisa. I would highly recommend this route for travellers interested in basing their trip in Tuscany, a region that warrants at least one, but up to three weeks to discover. With thanks to Qatar Airways for welcoming me to experience Tuscany on this new direct route!"
180,"Lisbon is a city that will surprise you, intrigue and delight you… but most of all, leave you in a world of unexplainable happiness. This city is bursting with life at every turn – colourful buildings, friendly locals, a great local community vibe. There quite honestly is nothing I did not enjoy about my last couple of tripe to Lisbon which gives me all the more reason to share the absolute stand outs from the city to ensure you enjoy your trip just as much! Here we go!  Hands down my favourite part of Lisbon and what sets Lisbon apart in my eyes is Alfama Neighbourhood. This area has an incredible old world charm, is covered in the colours of the rainbow and is where you’ll also find great local eateries! This Moorish castle is one of Lisbon’s most popular attractions and for good reason – it has one of the best views of the entire city! The ruins are interesting to walk around and the view is gorgeous on a clear day. If you love your cheese, you’re in a for a real treat when visiting Portugal! Locals will be quick to tell you to taste this creamy yellow cheese made of sheep’s milk and with hint of thistle flower (said to be the ingredient that makes this cheese so delicious). Paired with a bottle of Portuguese wine (also fabulous), you’ll have the perfect picnic!  One of my absolute favourite things to do in any city is to meet the locals, however it would be a crime not to make special mention of the locals in Lisbon as they are honestly some of the friendliest, most charming individuals I have ever encountered. Whether its the taxi driver or the bell boy, be sure to strike up a conversation and see what you learn! One of the best places to see the local life of Lisbon happening right before your eyes is at one of the local food markets. My favourite would be the Mercado da Ribeira near the riverfront, though if you visit Lisbon on a Tuesday or Saturday, make your way (in the morning) to the Feira da Ladra flea market – not to be missed! Another great view of the city up close can be found at Rua Augusta Arch, centrally located amongst the hustle and bustle of the city.  On the point of views, it is important to mention that often the best views of the city are completely FREE and will be completely sprung upon you without a moment’s notice. Wander on foot and you’ll find many great views without even trying to! As far as monasteries go, this is certainly one of the most impressive I have encountered. If architecture interests you and you’d up for something completely different, head over to Belém to encounter this beauty. Just be sure to stop by Pastéis de Belém for an afternoon snack! Whilst I love Lisbon and would say to anyone visiting you need at least 3 full days to explore the city, any days on top of that offer a great chance to get out of the capital city and venture to nearby Sintra and Cascais. Both of these small towns are full of charm and cannot be missed.  If there’s just one thing you eat in Lisbon, make it a Pastel de Nata from the famous and highly publicised Pastéis de Belém. Don’t do any further research on the topic – just go there, order a whole bunch, and eat yourself into a warm-eggy-tar-induced-coma. You won’t regret it! Whilst visiting Pastéis de Belém, be sure to take some time to enjoy the local area (a little out of the city, but has a way of feeling a world away!) Nearby Belém Tower is an icon of Lisbon and should not be missed! One of my favourite things I have ever done in Europe is riding in a sidecar in Lisbon. The tour lasted a few hours and took in most of the sites of the city, making it a great option if you’re short on time.  DO NOT EAT ANYWHERE ELSE IN LISBON BEFORE YOU HAVE EATEN HERE! Sure, that may sound a little dramatic… but trust me when I say this place is out-of-this-world good. The food is inventive and melts in your mouth, but you’ll always be left wanting more as the portions are tiny and the food just keeps on coming all night! Seriously one of my favourite restaurants – ever. Whilst exploring the hilly terrain of Lisbon, you might happen to stumble across Lisbon Cathedral, by which case you should certainly step inside for a look. The old trams run by here, making for a fantastic photographic opportunity if you can catch one as it passes by! Sometimes you don’t read about a certain attraction or disregard it as not of interest to you, but quite often these points of interest are the ones that surprise you and leave you in awe. Carmo Convent is one such place you should make an effort to visit as the architecture is stunning, especially in the Portuguese summer sun!  One of my most fond memories in Lisbon was a Sunday afternoon brunch (yes, afternoon – in Australia we have brunch between breakfast and lunch, but in Lisbon it is more of a lunch time affair). I sat down with 3 of my close friends and enjoyed what can only be described as a FEAST – the kind that leaves you in a food coma all day because your eyes were too big for your stomach. Lisbon is an absolute wonderland for door lovers (yes, that is a thing!) The streets are filled with colourful and quirky doors, often paved with intricate tiles around the door frame and even more often adorned with an array of pot plans. Throughout Lisbon you will find many beautiful entrances to homes – so be sure to open your eyes whilst you wander! Although I’m fairly certain that once you’ve seen one aquarium you’ve seen them all, there’s no denying that the Lisbon Aquarium is a huge attraction in the city and for good reason. If you’re visiting Lisbon with kids this is a great half day activity and not just because they have penguins (but largely because they have penguins!!!!)  One of the most distinct features about Lisbon is the antique charm – trams that look as if that have been caught in a time warp and winding cobblestone alleyways throughout the centre of town. Be sure to hop on board on of the trams and venture off in any direction – there is always something new to be discovered! One thing I will never forget about Lisbon is the intricacy of tiles, on display almost everywhere you look in the city. If you start geeking out (like me), then there’s a whole museum dedicated to tiles where you can appreciate the many different styles and patterns that have formulated over the years. For something a little different and certainly a lot less quieter than central Lisbon, head down to Praca do Comercio, which is located not far from the water. This public plaza shows another side to Lisbon, which by now you’re probably certain has many different facets! One of the biggest mistakes travellers make when visiting Lisbon is to only visit the capital city and not venture further into Portugal. On my first visit to Lisbon I did just that, but by round two I had learned better and made sure I spent four nights in the Algarve (Southern Portugal) to really get a grip on Portuguese culture. I have also heard rave reviews about Porto in the North – maybe next time!  "
181,"It may come as a surprise to hear that Prague is one of the most vegetarian and vegan-friendly cities to visit in all of Europe – but the good news is it is true! Some of my favourite vegetarian restaurants in all of Europe are here in the city, so be prepared to eat like a king or queen in the veggie-friendly city of Prague!  There are a few locations throughout the city but regardless of which one you pick, the food on offer at Beas Dhaba is delicious and extremely affordable. The casual dining restaurants are self serve buffets full of delicious veggie and vegan food. Týnská 19, 110 00 Staré Město  I’ve been saying for years this is my favourite vegetarian restaurant in the world. Now, after my fourth visit, I still think it might take the cake for my favourite! I can honestly say I have dreamed about the food at Lehka Hlava since my first visit. The goat’s cheese potato stack will blow your mind and the hot chocolate is the perfect desert. Boršov 280/2, 110 00 Staré Město  My second favourite restaurant in Prague and coincidentally the sister restaurant to Lehka Hlava is Maitrea, located just off the old town square. I like to visit this restaurant for the lunch special which is always really affordable and great food. Týnská ulička 1064/6, 110 00 Staré Město  On this year’s visit to Prague a found a new vegan restaurant near to my hotel and what a treasure it was! Vegan’s Prague is much less popular to the restaurants mentioned above which is partly due to its location, surrounded by Embassies in the quietest part of town – but the food was great! I had the raw vegan lasagne with cashew cream – ooh la la! Nerudova 221/36, 118 00 Malá Strana"
182,"As one of my favourite areas to explore not just in Europe but the entire world, I cannot express enough how many beautiful and unique places there are, that you must visit in Eastern Europe. Most if not all of these small towns, villages and cities are completely underrated and many of these places are once in a lifetime, fairytale, picturesque towns to visit. So, what are you waiting for!? Here are the 20 most charming places you must visit in Eastern Europe!  Brașov is a city located in Transylvania, a region of Romania renowned for its castles, eerily foggy skies and charming little towns and villages. Although classified as a city, Brașov feels much more like a small town to be discovered on foot, even when climbing to the infamous “Brasov sign” (a rip off of the Hollywood sign – yup, really!) From here you can explore the beautiful Bran Castle (also known as Dracula’s Castle) as well as nearby Peles Castle, said to be Europe’s most beautiful castle.  Commonly regarded as the prettiest town in Poland, Wroclaw is full of charm every which way you look. The buildings are bright and playful, with friendly locals giving this city a similar small town feel, especially when centring your explorations around the old town itself.  Located further North in the Baltics is the impossibly quaint and charming Riga; the capital of Latvia. This is a city that feels absolutely nothing like most capital cities in Europe, as it is characterised by its cobblestone streets that are at times impossible to navigate (in the best kind of way!)  Another great capital to visit is often referred to as the “Paris of the East”; Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Sofia is said to be one of Europe’s most laid-back capital cities, offering a charming east-meets-west feel with old and new coexisting throughout the city. Though many travellers overlook Sofia en route to Bulgaria’s resort coastal towns, one look at the architecture on offer might persuade you otherwise! (Image Source).  One of the most surprising cities I visited in Romania was completely by chance, as I was travelling by car from Brasov (Romania) through to Belgrade (Serbia) and stopped in to Sibiu to pick up supplies (every road trip needs snacks!) This city was so full of charm that I was skipping around the streets like a school girl… a true highlight from my Romanian adventures! (Image source).  If a picture tells a thousand words, there really is no need to explain the above photo of The Tunnel of Love in Ukraine. The tunnel is located near Klevan (closer to Lviv than Kiev) and stretches an impressive 3 kilometres in length! (Image Source).  Located on the Baltic sea a convenient ferry ride from Finland’s Helsinki, Tallinn is a hidden gem. If you find yourself in the Baltics this is by far and large one of the highlight cities to stop at and is incredibly well connected by air, land and sea. As far as sightseeing goes the best way to experience Tallinn is just to stroll without any intentions of seeing or doing anything at all… just stumble across things!  When I made a visit to Blagaj back in 2014 I expected to stay a few days, but wound up staying a full week in this gorgeous little town, located a 20-30 minute drive outside of better known Mostar in Bosnia & Herzegovina. Although there isn’t a whole heap to do (above is the Blagaj Tekke, the town’s biggest attraction, accompanied by the castle hike, these are the two sole attractions), the town is a fantastic chance to slow down and enjoy Eastern European hospitality. I stayed with a family who made me feel so welcome and gave me a great insight into local culture – by way of my stomach mostly!  I’m often heard singing the praise of the former Russian capital, St Petersburg, and today will be no exception! I am so incredibly fond of St Petersburg, once a city of tsars and full of endless fascination by way of Russian Royal history! The city is lined with canals much larger than you see in Venice and the streets are full of incredible architecture that will leave you dizzy from straining your neck just to take it all in!  This charming little town is perhaps the single place in all of Europe that looks as if it has been ripped completely out of a fairytale book. The terracotta rooftops glisten in the summer sun, whilst in winter it is often covered in a thick blanket of snow (which resulted in me falling over more than once!) If there were just one town I would send you to in Eastern Europe, it would be Cesky Krumlov… a town that forever has a piece of my heart.  Recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city of Lviv is unlike anywhere else you will visit in Ukraine. This city is charming and incredibly so… without even trying the city will lure you in and leave you wanting more time here, never less. Be sure to allow at least a few days in Lviv to wander the lush green parks and colourfully lined streets that are just bursting with intriguing architecture! (Image source).  There’s no denying that Budapest has become incredibly popular over the past few years or even the past decade, but I still hold the opinion that Budapest is one of the most underrated cities in Europe. Despite its increasing popularity, Budapest has so much more to offer than originally meets the eye – beyond the public bath houses and impressive city views at Fisherman’s Bastion, there is much more to see in the Hungarian capital. Allow yourself at least 4 days to explore this still somewhat hidden gem.  Skopje is another of Europe’s most charming small capital cities. Throughout the ages Skopje has been influenced by a number of different regimes, and today continues to show influence from the Roman Empire, Byzantine and Ottoman Empires. (Image source).  This is hands down one of the most idyllic settings for a city to be located. Located in the Balkans, the city of Kotor in Montenegro is situated beside a bay and enjoys a much lighter tourist visitation than nearby Dubrovnik, making it a great little gem to discover off the beaten path! (Image Source).  One of my all time favourite capital cities in Europe is the highly underestimated Ljubljana (yup, its a mouthful!) If you have just one day in Ljubljana perhaps en route to the popular Lake Bled, you should still make time for a visit as this is a great city to discover in 3 hours or less due to its size and walkability.  Over the past few years and especially since the inception of Game of Thrones on our television screens, Dubrovnik has become an incredibly popular tourist destination and perhaps could be said to have put Croatia on the map. There is much to discover along the entire coastline of Croatia, though Dubrovnik in all of its old world charm is a logical place to start!  Not too long ago in 2008 Berat was dubbed a UNESCO World Heritage Site, showing just how much heritage this small city has to preserve! Albania is one of Eastern Europe’s least visited countries, making it another great choice if you’re looking to get off the beaten path. (Image source).  Another standout from my travels in Bosnia & Herzegovina was this gorgeous little town attached to a cliff side, surrounded by lush greenery and glistening in the Spring sunshine. Bosnia & Herzegovina is still very much flying under the radar and will likely become a hot spot in coming years, so be sure to put it on your list and discover it before the crowds come!  I never expected I would love Serbia’s capital nearly as much as I did. As a big city, I never expected it to be charming as such, despite many travellers telling me I “had to go there and see for myself”… so I did! Indeed, this is a very charming capital city with a large al fresco dining scene and a great insight into the history of the Former Yugoslavia. (Image source).  Whilst Peles Castle may not be a town or a city, it is a charming little place that deserves its’ very own listing in this article because it is just. that. beautiful. Romania in general is absolutely full of surprises, so if I could recommend just one place you should have on your list in Eastern Europe, Romania would be it!  "
183,"My idea of dreams coming true is when two of my greatest passions collide: travelling and baking. You might have noticed many more recipes and sweet treats making their way to my blog recently. Especially since I opened my dessert restaurant Charlie’s Dessert House late last year! And now I make an annual trip to Paris for training, hence this story on the best French pastry class in Paris. The idea in opening my restaurant was to focus on bringing sweets from around the world back to my hometown and fulfilling my passions for pastry in the meantime. But because I still love travelling and want to keep exploring while the opportunity is there for me, it has been a bit of a juggling act between my two passions. Recently I booked a trip to Paris for both of these passions to come together in one place, which also happens to be the centre of pastry for the whole world! This is where you can take the best pastry class in Paris if you’d like to learn from the best!  Prior to my class, I have already been making macarons for the shop, however, have found myself becoming inconsistent and wanting to ask a professional all the ins and outs of macaron making to ensure our bite-sized treats are the best in town. The class I booked was €99 for a three-hour macaron class at La Cuisine Paris. This seemed a fair price to pay for three hours of quizzing a French pastry chef, so I happily obliged and booked my course for a Thursday morning, followed by a croissant making class the next day.  While I believe the only way to get a really good idea of macarons and their secrets is to take a class or learn from a professional, I’m going to do my best to recount the class and provide some tips for you to help improve your macarons skills at home (plus with the new video, you’ll be a pro in no time!) The first thing we did was to measure out ingredients (mis en place) and begin preparing our pastry creams and ganache fillings for the different flavoured macarons.  An ongoing debate that I constantly find myself questioning, is whether to follow the Italian or French method when making macarons. The main difference between the two is that the Italian method involves hot sugar syrup, whereas the French method involves only raw sugar (and thus is a lot easier). Because I had never been shown the Italian method and believed I was pouring the heated sugar wrong, I started to follow the French method for the past few months working in the bakery. However knowing that the main macaron houses (Laduree, Pierre Herme) follow the Italian method, I was eager to learn this in the masterclass so that I could produce higher quality macarons.  Because the quality of the Italian method macarons is that much higher, I was delighted to learn the ins and outs of getting the recipe correct to produce perfect macarons (and thus will never revert back to the French method!) Another important note is to always sift your almond meal + icing sugar mix and to discard the large parts of the mixture. I have read in many recipes to do this twice or three times, however Guilleme, my pastry chef teacher, assures me once is enough.  The next step of the Italian Method (which I’ll provide the recipe for soon on the blog – promise!) is to create a paste with egg whites and the almond mix. Guilleme then allowed us to choose our colour and incorporate this into the mix before the hard part begins.  This is by far the hardest part about making macarons and where most budding bakers go wrong. The important thing to note (which will be much easier to demonstrate in the upcoming video), is not to overmix your batter. Using a folding technique you should fold only 8 or so times before checking your mixture and shortly thereafter it will be at the “lava” stage, ready for piping.  One of the areas I never thought I failed on is piping, however, there was a key mistake I have been making that Guilleme corrected for me and will result in much better macarons for Charlie’s! My issue was to release the bag and lift to soon, not allowing enough time for the macaron to disperse itself (if anything, macarons are about patience!)  The purpose of this blog is to give you a little insight into my masterclass and hopefully encourage you to book your own when in Paris – I really did learn a lot! The next day I went back to learn how to make croissants and breakfast pastries, which was also a great class and a quick way to learn techniques from the pros themselves. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in making macarons like a pro and only wish I had more time in Paris to continue learning French pastry skills!  Afterwards, Guilleme gave each participant a map with an extensive list of pastry equipment shops, patisseries, foodie finds and all sorts of insider secrets to Paris (many of which you will see recommended on this blog). If you’re a baker or aspiring to own your own bakery one day, this has been one of the best ways for me to master my skills and learn quickly on the spot. Highly recommended! "
184,"Medieval, magical and inviting… Prague is one of Europe’s most memorable cities that continues to awe me time after time, even after a handful of visits. The allure of the Charles Bridge on an icy morning in January, the beauty of a sunset in the warm summer nights and even the city covered in a thick layer of snow that brings your fingers to freeze through thick woollen gloves – there has been no time in Prague that I haven’t felt completely embraced by this intriguing city. And yet while Prague may look like a small town riddled with tales to span centuries, the city of Prague is sprawling with many different neighbourhoods offering their own unique flair. Here’s how to discover the best of Prague in a self guided Prague walking guide.  If this is your first visit to Prague you have likely seen the postcard views, intriguing architecture, and perhaps fallen victim to the eery allure of the Charles Bridge on a winter’s morning. Each season brings a new feeling to the city of Prague, but in all honesty there is no bad time of year to visit. The first time I visited Prague was in a thick layer of knee-high snow in 2012, followed by a spring visit a couple of years later. The last time I found myself in Prague was at the end of Autumn and beginning of winter, but even an in-between season visit brought the magic of Prague I have come to know and love. It is without hesitation that I say the best way to see Prague is on foot, so be sure to pack some comfy shoes, a bottle of water, some cash for the endless amount of pitstops you are about to endure and get ready to see Prague! Route walking time: 1 hour, 20 minutes without stops Distance: 5.9 kilometres  Although an unlikely and often unheard of point to commence your walking tour of Prague, Vrtba Garden is the perfect positioning to begin exploring the Prague’s lesser quarter. Built between 1715 & 1720, the garden was constructed in traditional baroque Italian style, with perfectly trimmed hedges in symmetrical formation. Not only is this a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle outside of the entrance, Vrtba Garden also offers magnificent views of the surrounding landscape, making it the perfect positioning to commence your walking tour of Prague. This is one of Prague’s few “lesser known” attractions that any visitor will tell you you cannot miss, so be sure to make the most of this insider tip and allow yourself a good hour here in the serenity! What: Jardin vrtbovská Where: Karmelitská 373/25, 118 00 Praha 1-Malá Strana, Czechia  From the Vrtba Gardens, take a left toward St. Nicholas Church, a short 350 metre walk away. This church serves as a central point in the lesser quarter of Prague, where you can see the livelihood of this neighbourhood at every turn. Step inside to marvel at the baroque architecture of this church, which replaced a 13th century gothic church that was also dedicated to Saint Nicholas. What: Baroque Church in Lesser Prague Where: Malostranské nám., 118 00 Praha 1-Malá Strana, Czechia  From the Church of Saint Nicholas, get ready to begin your upwards climb towards Prague Castle. Be sure not to miss Pražská čokoláda (Prgaue Chocolate), located at the base of the stairs and famous for their chocolate covered almonds (with free samples!) Be sure to allow at least an hour or more to explore the Prague Castle complex, as there is much to see once inside. This is also one of the most confusing castles to visit in Europe (if you ask me), with no clear indication of where to head next, so be sure to consider a hosted guide or at the very least an audio guide if you wish to make the most of your visit. The 9th Century Castle attracts many visitors each year, all vying for their photo of the straight-faced guards placed at the entrance to the castle. Be sure to drop by Golden Lane for a look at some artisanal shops, before heading onwards to St. Vitus Cathedral. What: 9th Century Castle Where: 119 08 Prague 1, Czechia Located next to Prague Castle you will find St. Vitus Cathedral, home to the Archbishop of Prague. The history of this Roman Catholic church is almost as old as Prague itself, so be sure to step inside for a step back in time. What: Gothic Cathedral Where: III. nádvoří 48/2, 119 01 Praha 1, Czechia Heading back down-hill, be sure to stop by the Lennon Wall before stepping foot on Prague’s most photographed attraction: The Charles Bridge. Just before you cross the bridge toward the Old Town of Prague, you will find this graffiti wall inspired by John Lennon, complete with song lyrics and peace signs, which was created in the 1980’s. What: Lenon-inspired graffiti wall Where: Velkopřevorské náměstí, 100 00 Praha 1, Czechia Onwards to the Old Town, you absolutely cannot miss the chance to walk across the Charles Bridge: the reason many visitors choose to visit Prague! This historic bridge crosses the Vltava River and is hands down the biggest highlight of the city. Although overcrowded on a good day, the best way to see the bridge is once in the morning, once during the day, and once in the evening. The bridge boasts 16 arches and is lined with a total of 30 Baroque statues and figurines. What: Historic Bridge named after King Charles IV Where: Karlův most, 110 00 Praha 1, Czechia  Completely surrounded by the Old Town, Josefov is a time warp neighbourhood previously known as the Jewish ghetto. As one of my favourite neighbourhoods to wander in Prague, today you will find an abundance of antiques stores, clock stores, postcards and souvenirs. One of the must see places in Josefov is the Hebrew clock on top of the Old Town Hall – located underneath the regular clock and running backwards. What: Former Jewish ghetto Where: Josefov (neighbourhood) As the historic centre of Prague, one absolutely cannot miss a visit (or a few visits!) to the Old Town Square of Prague. The various architectural styles are evident in one 360 turn, with an abundance of village life and attractions to visit within a short distance of one another. The best way to experience the Old Town is to wander through the many alleyways and boutiques without a plan or direction. What: Historic Square in the Old Town Where: Staroměstské nám., 110 00 Praha 1-Staré Město, Czechia Whilst in the Old Town be sure to wander over towards the large crowds to get a glimpse of the Astronomical Clock – full of legends and mystery. What: Medieval Astronomical Clock Where: Staroměstské nám. 1, 110 00 Praha 1-Staré Město, Czechia After a complete history lesson of the oldest parts of Prague, head towards Wenceslas Square in “New Town” for a look at real Prague or more accurately, where you’ll find locals in one of the busiest shopping areas in the city. It is here where you will find many international brands and designers. What: Main shopping area Where: New Town, 110 00 Prague 1, Czechia Onwards toward the Vltava River, make your way to the Prague National Theatre. Along the way you will pass by Cafe Louvre – one of the gorgeous time-warp cafes I would recommend a pitstop at for a coffee or hot chocolate. Another great cafe stop is right by the National Theatre, named Cafe Slavia, one of the oldest cafes in Prague where a pianist plays in the evenings, coat check is a must and smoking inside is still fashionable. What: National Theatre to enjoy Opera & Ballet Where: Národní 2, 110 00 Praha 1, Czechia Walking along the Vltava River, this is undeniably one of my favourite strolls in all of Central Europe! Along the way you can marvel at the architecture to your left, whilst taking in the gorgeous views of the Vltava River on your right. What: Longest river in the Czech Republic  Finally, end your walking tour of Prague at the must-see-to-be-believed Fred & Ginger “Dancing House”. Although out of the way, it is here where you will see the sprawling size of the city of Prague, view of the old trams as they pass by and take in the views of the Vltava River. What: Architectural marvel Where: Jiráskovo nám. 1981/6, 120 00 Praha 2-Nové Město, Czechia  Over to you! What were your highlights from Prague!?"
185,"It is no secret that I am an overt francophile. And if you’re wondering what that means, it is a person who is greatly fond of France and the French lifestyle. So, simply put, that is me! I love so much about French culture – the food, the relaxed pace of life that warrants more living, the wine, the countryside. You name it, I love it. And if you’re reading this, you are probably just like me. So, here’s how to feel more French in six quick steps. Each of which are tried and tested by me and are quickly becoming more a part of my lifestyle. Many of you will already know I have been learning French this past month with Rosetta Stone. And if you’re wondering how it is going? Très magnifique! I have visited France a handful of times, but my French language skills have never progressed beyond the pleasantries. And while learning a new language later in life is said to be more difficult, it is certainly not impossible!  I’ve tried a few different language courses over the years and I can see why Rosetta Stone is rated as the leading language course provider in the world. The online lessons prompt me to speak French, listen to French, write French and read French. Believe me when I say it works! This one is more of a lifestyle choice that I have been trying to follow for the last eight years I have spent travelling the world. I find a lot of peace knowing everything I own can be packed inside just two suitcases. And it isn’t just a personal preference – it is part of the French lifestyle. This is particularly true of Parisians who live inside small apartments and limit their possessions to just the essentials. But it goes much more beyond that – have you ever noticed how French women wear less makeup and live a fairly uncomplicated lifestyle? That is the very definition of très chic! Many of you will already know my love for French pastries runs deep. For three years in a row I travelled back to Paris every April to learn a new French patisserie skill. From macarons to croissants and even brioche bread, the list of delicious French pastries you can make yourself is practically endless!  I would recommend starting out with something a little more simple like eclairs before navigating the complexities of macarons. Believe me, I have been there! But once you start to learn the basics of French pastry, you can ease yourself into more difficult techniques.  Another way to feel more French is to take a walk to your local farmer’s market on a Saturday and fill your linen grocery bags with all the fresh produce you can find! Shopping locally and organically is a very important part of French culture and in cities like Paris it is very much a part of daily life. Just like everything else in life, the French believe in quality over quantity and that certainly is true of food.  Not only is shopping for food important, but so is the art of eating it! Forget quick dinners standing at your kitchen counter and replace these with long nights socialising with friends or catching up with family. If you prefer to dine solo, throw on a record in the background or light some candles. You’d be surprised how much more enjoyable mealtimes are when you actually take the time out of your day to make them an event. From dressing to impress to a daily skincare routine, the French certainly know how to take care of themselves from the inside out. My favourite nights are often those spent in the bathtub with a glass of red wine and a good book on hand. But the truth is I only make time for this once a week, so what about every other day of the week? Establishing a healthy skincare routine is a great way to get your daily pamper in, as well as feeling great inside your skin and spending less time (and money) on make-up. After all, the French do believe less is more! I have incorporated both a morning and night skincare routine into my daily rituals and it helps me to establish the start and end of the working day.  Reading is still very much a part of French culture, particularly when it comes to escaping inside the pages of a good novel. You will notice this if you take a walk down any street in Paris and quickly discover small boutique bookstores on almost every corner. And it isn’t just the act of reading a book that the French so love, but the fact that it forces you to slow down and take time for yourself. Whether you’re in the countryside on summer vacation or just tucking up on the couch with a good book, reading is a great way to feel more French. Sign up for the World of Wanderlust book club for book recommendations *actually* worth reading! This post is in partnership with Rosetta Stone to celebrate my role as an ambassador for their language program. All opinions are my own!"
186,"Ordering lunch in Paris is no easy feat. Parisian waiters are not naturally friendly and most restaurants do not accommodate for special dietary requirements. This isn’t for being unfriendly on purpose, but for the sheer amount of tourists these waiters see and serve each day. So it’s handy to know the game and also helps to speak a word or two of French. Here’s a guide of what to do and what not to do when ordering lunch at a Parisian cafe.  First things first, always say “Bonjour” or “Bonsoir” depending on whether it’s daytime or nighttime. In France a greeting must come before any request or question and will go a long way to getting you a table. If you’d like to learn French, I can highly recommend language course French is Beautiful by Carrie Ann James.  In France they simply state how many people there are rather than asking for a table. So if there’s three of you, simply say “nous sommes trois” and the waiter will do his best to find you a table for three. The best bit? All you need to remember is your numbers. There are two of us – “nous sommes deux” There are three of us – “nous sommes trois” There are four of us – “nous sommes quatre”  Lunching in France is something, which ought to be enjoyed and not rushed hence why Parisians take long lunches and consequently work late into the night. Lunching is seen as a pastime where you can spend a good couple of hours drinking wine, conversing with those around the table and savouring the food. After all eating fast will only cause indigestion…  Parisians tend to eat very delicately, very politely and very slowly. It’s the little things that count such as putting your napkin on your lap, eating with your mouth closed and chewing each mouthful properly.  A little bit of French can go a long way. Buy a little book of phrases to get you started. It’s a fun challenge for the trip and the best way to learn a language is by practising. Here’s a couple of sentences to get you started: On peut avoir une carafe d’eau – Can we have a jug of water please? Quel est le plat du jour? – What is today’s special? Je voudrais du pain – I would like some bread Quelle sorte de poissons avez-vous au menu? – What kind of fish is on the menu?  Parisian women may all be lovely and slender but maintaining their slight figures comes from moderation instead of deprivation. If you’re watching your weight, eat less of your dressed salad but heaven forbid asking for your sauce on the side. Whilst they kindly cater for it in the States, Parisian waiters disapprove and may instantly dub you as the American in Paris.  Unless you want to initiate heavy sighs and rolling eyes from the surrounding customers and waiters…  As nicely as the wine is going down, French waiters have little tolerance for drunks around the table and won’t hesitate to ask you to leave, especially if you’re a tourist/expat.  Dairy is engrained into French cuisine so being lactose intolerant is pretty much incomprehensible in Paris. Magrit de Canard without the butter? Pas possible. Croque Monsieur without the cheese? Pas Possible. Steak without the peppercorn sauce? Pas possible. Alas so is the attitude of the Parisian waiter…  Even if you don’t speak a word of French prior to your trip, it helps to learn a few words and make a bit of effort. It can be deemed slightly obnoxious to assume that everyone will understand you speaking English.  It’s the done thing and after all you’re tying to fit in so don’t slip at the final hurdle… With these tips, I’m sure you’ll fool everyone into thinking you’re a natural Parisian luncher. Bonne Chance! Photography by Faye Bullock"
187,"If you were to ask anyone where you’ll find the best secret beaches in Europe, you’ll always get a different answer. The Italians will tell you they’ve got the best beaches, the Greek will tell you theirs are the best and the absolute best secret beaches remain off the beaten path for you to discover as you wander on your own accord. But we’ve managed to find twelve absolutely stunning secret beaches in Europe that you probably haven’t heard about and as is always the case with the best secrets… they won’t stay secret for long! Get ready to escape this summer to these twelve top picks:  Also referred to as the golden horn, the name itself commands your attention. This gorgeous piece of coastline can be found in South of Croatia in the Dalmatia region. Stay in nearby Bol for the closest access.  via wikicommons The Italians sure do have their fair share of spectacular coastline but with so many locals and visitors flocking to the beaches in summer, it can often be hard to find a little slice of tranquility of your own. Isola Bella beach in Sicily is just that.  via This little seaside village is an absolute gem in southern Spain, so close to Morocco that you could almost swim across (not really, but you can catch a ferry). Do as the locals do in summer… that is, not much of anything really!  via ibtimes.co.uk Although it isn’t easy to access, this only makes Virgin Island’s Creek (also known as Île Vierge or Point of Saint Hernot) in Brittany all the more appealing.  via istock Sicily has an array of soft sandy beaches with crystal clear blue waters to enjoy. If you’re looking for somewhere to really escape those summer crowds, then a trip to the south of Italy would be entirely worth your while.  via Turismo da Madeira Portugal is full of beautiful beaches but none more secluded than those in Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal made up of four islands. If there could be just one place to escape to complete seclusion, this would be it.  via brittanytourism While the rest of France is busy making their way to the South of France, the answer seems obvious: head North. Brittany is full of beautiful beaches that are much less crowded than the South of France and Ploumanac’h is one of Brittany’s best.  via Mallorca is another hidden paradise for beach lovers, especially if you’re headed south to the 10km stretch known as Es Trenc.  via corsica.co.uk Another gorgeous (and more importantly hidden) beach in the Mediterranean  is Pinarello beach in Corsica, a French island filled with mountains, steep cliff faces and absolute seclusion!  If you’re looking for a secret beach in Croatia, it has been found: Saharun beach is one of Croatia’s most stunning and somehow still little known beaches.  via sardiniatour.co.uk This small town in Sardinia, Italy has some fantastic beaches to explore and often you can enjoy them almost entirely to yourself. With the crystal clear waters and that hot Italian sun, there’s hardly any reason not to come!  And finally the Cíes Islands, an archipelago in Spain are another great area for complete calm in Spain. They’re such a paradise that you can let your mind wander and go hunt for treasure or just do as the locals do: sun, tan, sea."
188,"If you’ve visited my blog before you will know my love for Paris knows no end. Since a young age I have had an (un)healthy obsession with the French capital. From learning to make croissants in an underground kitchen to spending days retracing the steps of Zelda Fitzgerald, each trip to Paris still feels unique. Whether you are visiting Paris for the first time or looking to explore Paris like a local beyond the tourist sites, this guide will have you feeling like a local in no time! Over the years and many visits to Paris, no trip has felt more local than my last. I checked in to a gorgeous Paris Perfect apartment, owned by a boutique agency that host a collection of beautiful and oh so French apartments in Paris. The apartment I booked had the most incredible view of the Eiffel Tower (so perfect in fact that I found it difficult to ever want to leave). The view became even more magnificent of the evenings when the sky was dark and the tower glittered in all of its glory. There are a handful of neighbourhoods I adore in Paris and one of these is the ritzy Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Filled with vintage boutiques, gallery-lined streets and some of the most fashionable cafes in the city, walking around Saint Germain could be done in a few hours or an entire day. If you are visiting Paris solo, the good news is Paris is completely safe to walk on your own during the day. There are only a few areas that wouldn’t be considered safe in the evenings and Saint Germain is definitely not one of them. However if you are travelling to Paris alone, I would always recommend keeping your wits during the evening regardless of the arrondissement. Some highlights of Saint Germain include Musee Delacroix, Les Deux Magots, Cafe de Flore and the endless stream of patisseries that line the main boulevard. See the full World of Wanderlust travel guide to Saint Germain des Pres. Nowhere does concept stores like Paris. Ever since Colette closed down, concept stores have been popping up all over the city to no end. There are some of my favourite finds listed below to have you feeling oh so French in no time: Merci – Undeniably the most recognised concept store in Paris and indeed one of the largest, Merci has everything French from soap brands to handbags and linen labels. Assouline – The famous publisher is a mecca for coffee table books to suit every interest. The store in Saint Germain is one of my favourite places to stay a while. FrenchTrotters – Home to multiple French brands housed in one fabulously designed setting. One of two remaining natural islands in Paris, Île de la Cité is the old Paris we’ve seen in 1950’s films. This feels like the heart of the city and is of course home to the must-not-miss Notre Dame Cathedral as well as nearby Saint Chapelle Chapel. One of my favourite ways to discover a new city is to eat it. The next (natural) step is to cook it yourself and taste your creations! Pastry classes in Paris have been my go-to for the past three years. Each year I fly myself to Paris to learn a new pastry skill and I’m constantly learning so much from French chefs! These are my favourite Paris pastry classes for macarons, choux pastry and brioche bread. The quickest way to feel Parisian is to dress like a Parisian. The local style is effortless, chic and in the modern age, unique and unrefined. One of my favourite books I have ever read on this topic is How to be Parisian. See this guide for more on how to dress like a Parisian. My friends all joke that I own an entire library of Parisian books. From guides to the city to classics like Hemmingway’s A Moveable Feast, I own it. Having read endless guides to Paris that have navigated my way around the city year after year, I have come to learn that my favourite days in Paris are Sundays. Sundays in Paris are slow and steady. The entire city feels lighter, especially if you find yourself in Le Marais where shops and cafes are bustling with local way of life. Read more on this topic from another favourite book of mine, Sundays in Paris. You’ll find so many options inside this book that you won’t want to miss a single Sunday in Paris! The WOW Guide to Paris"
189,"Every year I travel to Paris to learn a new pastry skill. The first class I attended three years ago was a macaron masterclass and ever since, I’ve been obsessed with learning new pastry skills. This article will introduce you to the best pastry classes in Paris and where to find them. Since then I have learned you can sneak in to The Ritz Paris basement kitchen for a more intricate lesson and there are a handful of other half day courses and multi-day courses to learn pastry skills in Paris, most of which I have tried and tested. If you are considering booking a pastry lesson in Paris and want to know which classes are the best for what, I’ve got you covered. Here are the best pastry classes in Paris. We will begin with the most popular class in Paris. Macarons are one of the most popular pastries on the market in Paris, costing up to $3 a pop! These bite sized biscuits are full of flavour and because of how tasty they are, have quickly become Paris’ staple take home dessert. If you’ve ever wondered why macarons are so expensive (say compared to a cupcake) I speak from experience when I say they are not easy to make. The process of making macarons is long and very particular, forcing you to measure out your ingredients to the gram. The delicious centres are also made my hand, often involving expensive ingredients like vanilla beans and freeze dried raspberry powder. Macaron classes in Paris are plentiful but they still manage to book out well in advance. I have tried two macaron masterclasses in Paris, having already taught myself macarons from home. Both of these classes were great and I think in all honesty were very on par with one another. This is also your chance to ask a French pastry chef all your burning macaron questions (like: do you really need to age egg whites?) La Cuisine Paris – this was the first macaron class I went to three years ago hosted by Guillem, a French Pastry Chef. Price: €99 Duration: 3 hours masterclass Le Foodist – the second class I attended and also a great option was at Le Foodist in the Latin Quarter. I would suggest this class for first time macaron makers. Price: €99 Duration: 3 hours Choux pastry was not my first choice of classes in Paris but surprisingly was my favourite class I’ve taken in Paris. In this class you will learn how to make perfect eclairs and choux puffs as well as taste test them (of course!) I think I enjoyed this class so much because it was a new pastry skill to me and great to learn the little tricks to perfectly piping eclairs. La Cuisine Paris – La Cuisine offer choux classes in mornings and evenings on select days of the week. Price: €69 Duration: 2 hours The smell of fresh bread and Paris go hand in hand. Not being a huge bread eater myself (blasphemous, I know…) I had never been too interested to learn bread making techniques until I saw that Le Foodist were offering Baguette and Brioche classes. Being a lover of French Toast (specifically brioche French Toast) I knew I had to go. The results were amazing and I loved learning more about dough in the process. This was a highly informative class and one of my favourites I have ever taken part in. Le Foodist – Le Foodist run the Baguettes and Brioche classes in the morning on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. It is a great way to wake up feeling oh so French! Price: €129 Duration: 4 hours Croissants are maybe my all time favourite pastry (and by maybe I mean definitely maybe). However I’ve got to be brutally honest – making them is a real pain in the arse. The time and effort into making croissants yourself is not worth the reward in my opinion, especially when you can get a bomb croissant at any French boulangerie for a euro or so. The class was fun all the same but there is practically no chance I will be re-using these skills at home. La Cuisine Paris – La Cuisine offer croissant classes in the basement and this is where I did my class. Price: €99 Duration: 3 hours The technical name for this class was in fact “French Entremets” but fancy cakes is a direct translation provided by yours truly. This class was only provided in French and translated to English by one of the chefs. The class was intense, very technical but really fun and I learned so much. This is the most I have learned in any of the classes in Paris so I would highly suggest it for someone who is in the industry or looking to enhance their skills in pastry. Ritz Escoffier – This class takes place in the basement of the Ritz. Stepping inside the hotel is like stepping into a dream where your grandmother is the Queen of France and everything is so over the top your eyes water a little at how much money the curtains alone would cost. Price: €160 Duration: 4 hours The WOW Guide to Paris"
190,"The city of canals, Venice, is unlike any other. Italy is full of charm and charisma (not only from the locals), but nowhere is more romantic as Venice. For everything you should see, do and best of all eat in Venice, here’s your bucket list to get you going!  The landmark cathedral might just be the single most iconic building in the entire city. Whether on the grand canal or from point to point, hop on a water taxi to truly experience the (ever receding) waterways. Getting lost is often the best adventure of all and nowhere is that more true than Venice! Pizza, pasta, minestrone, tiramisu… you name it. Eat it. As one of the main bridges in Venice, the Rialto bridge is one of the most impressive and photographic.  Although overpriced, cafes in Piazza San Marco offer some of the best people watching in the entire city. Kick back, unwind, and pay the hefty price to do so. Just ‘cos. Another of Venice’ great bridges to discover is the bridge of sighs, an enclosed bridge made of white limestone. Visit the area of Dorsoduro for the highest land area in the city but more importantly, a gorgeous area to walk around and get lost in! You can’t come to Italy (or for that matter any city in Italy) and not eat gelato… and lots of it! Hazelnut is a personal fave, though in Venice you can buy almost every flavour. There is not on thing more iconic than riding a gondola in Venice. Although overpriced, you pay per boat so fill it up with anyone and everyone who wants to share, sit back and take it all in.  Venetians love their wine so what better way to discover local classics and those from further afield in Italy than a secret walking tour! There are many great walking food and wine tours to discover, here’s just one recommendation. San Marco Campanile is where you will enjoy the best view of the city from above – featuring those endless terracotta rooftops and canals in the distance. If you so happen to be in Venice in late January – early February then you absolutely cannot pass up the opportunity to attend the Venice Carnival and don a Venetian mask. If you’re looking for a souvenir actually worth buying, then in Venice look no further than Murano glass. Most travellers come to Venice for just 1-2 days to rush through the sites, but the best way to see the city is to spend a while exploring the neighbourhoods beyond the tourist sites, following local recommendations you receive once there!"
191,"Our journey begins in Antwerp, one of Belgium’s less visited cities but arguably its best secret. The more popular choice to visit is of course the Belgian capital, Brussels, however I much prefer the low key lifestyle in Antwerp. The sun doesn’t rise until nearly 9:00am in winter so once you’ve made the most of your breakfast buffet or grabbed something on the go, make your way to the train station and book your ticket to Bruges. Once you arrive in Bruges I would highly recommend dropping in to the tourist information centre and grabbing a free map (in English – don’t make the same mistake we did!) We also asked the lady behind the counter for the best walking route in to town and I’m so glad we did as it isn’t the most direct route. The map (the freebie, go grab one) highlights the best walking path into the city centre. After a brisk walk in to the city centre (it was 0 degrees when we visited), be sure to drop in to Godiva for a hot chocolate to warm yourself up. Godiva is located in the Grote Market itself and although some will tell you it is overhyped (a little expensive), I couldn’t disagree more! It was the best 4 euros I spent that day. If this is your first time visiting Bruges, you may wish to climb the steps to the top of the Belfry (bell tower) in the Grote Markt for an incredible view of the city below. The Basilica of the Holy Blood is an impressive Roman Catholic church built in the early 12th century. If you’re looking for more things to do in indoors (it does get really cold out) then this is a great option to spend some time inside. While it isn’t really a point of interest, it is hands down my favourite way to pass time in Bruges. This city is built on a series of waterways which make for a fun boat ride in the summer months but in winter, walking the canals is just as pretty. There’s one thing Bruges does really well that can’t be contested: cozy winter vibes. We were fortunate to have a completely sunny day for our visit but be warned, rain is extremely common in Bruges throughout the winter months! There are some highly celebrated restaurants here in Bruges including one that holds an impressive 3 Michelin Stars. That restaurant is Hertog Jan. The restaurant is housed in an 180 year old barn overlooking a lush garden. Although it is on the expensive side, it certainly counts as one of those once in a lifetime experiences. If you allow yourself an entire day to visit Bruges from Brussels or Antwerp, you will also be able to visit Ghent in the same day. The two main differences between the cities are that Bruges has a very tourist-centric old town, whereas Ghent feels much more local and filled with residents. Ghent is a popular student town with a big university population so if you’re young and able, there are some great bars and cheap eats to try in town. The train journey from Bruges to Ghent is only 15 minutes or so. I would recommend getting off the second stop on the train at Gent Dampoort station. This station is just a ten minute walk from town. My single favourite recommendation for Ghent is to drop by De Alchemist, a really great bar we found in the centre of town. It is incredibly small but cozy in winter, dimly lit by candles on the tables and operates as a one-man show. "
192,"Lake Bled is one of Slovenia’s most popular tourist destinations. Located in the Julien Alps, Lake Bled is as serene as it looks in photos and a visit to this romantic lake is as surreal as you would be led to believe. Below is the ultimate guide to visiting Lake Bled which will help you plan your stay. This Lake Bled travel blog will give you all the information you need to plan your visit to Lake Bled. Whether you are visiting for just a day visit or are planning a week or more of adventures in summer, this guide will tell you everything you need to know to visit Lake Bled. Lake Bled is a popular day trip from Ljubljana. There are a few ways to arrive in Lake Bled including public transport and self-drive from Ljubljana to Lake Bled. Depending on your travel plans for Slovenia, these are your options: It will take you 1 hour and 20 minutes to travel from Ljubljana to Lake Bled by bus. This is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to arrive in Lake Bled, costing just 7 euros. This is the best option if you are visiting Lake Bled as a day trip from Ljubljana. There are two train stations in Lake Bled: Lesce train station and Jezero Bled train station. Neither of them are extremely central but if you don’t mind a bit of swapping transport, the system works easily enough. If you arrive to Lesce train station you will need to switch to a bus for the further 4.5 kilometres to reach Lake Bled. If you arrive at Lesce train station you will be around 3 kilometres from the town of Bled, on the Western side of the lake. Driving from Ljubljana to Lake Bled is very easy and well sign posted. The journey will take approximately 45 minutes without traffic. Kranj and Skofja Loka are beautiful towns to stop in if you’d like to see more of Slovenia and are both located on the way to Lake Bled. The activities on offer in Lake Bled are plentiful, however the timing of your visit will play a large role in determining what you can do while in Lake Bled. The best way to start your time in Lake Bled is of course to walk around the lake. To walk the entire lake in a circuit will take between 1-2 hours. You may need extra time to stop and take photos because believe me, this is one photogenic location! If you would like to get a view of the lake from above, the best viewpoint is from Mala Osojnica. The hike will take around 1 hour to complete, allowing for some time at the top to enjoy the view. Another great way to experience the lake is to be on it by boat, pletna, paddle board or kayak. In the summer months there is no end to the amount of activities on offer! Swimming in the lake almost feels like an essential in the warmer months. It was an impressive 30 degrees celsius during my time in Lake Bled and I’m happy to report the lake is beautifully warm! I first visited Lake Bled back in 2015 during autumn when the weather was much, much colder. This year I returned in the summer time and it is safe to say it was a very different experience. The lake is beautiful to visit any time of year, however if you have your heart set on a certain way of experiencing it, there are better times to visit than others. Summer (June, July, August) in Bled is hot, sunny and beautiful. This is the best time of year to experience all the lake has to offer as everything will be open during this time and for longer hours. This is the best time to swim in the lake as it is beautiful and warm. Spring (March, April, May) is arguably the next best time to visit. Some people prefer to visit in this season as there are fewer crowds, however it is still popular during this time. Winter and Fall (September-February) are much colder but it is still a beautiful time of year to see the lake. Fall is beautiful as the leaves change colour and winter can sometimes mean a light layer of snow and skiing nearby. It is important to note, however, that a great number of restaurants, cafes and activities are closed over the colder months. There are so hotels, restaurants and tours to choose from in Lake Bled that it can often be a little overwhelming. As someone who has visited in both the off season and busy season, these are my top recommendations for Lake Bled: Vila Bled is the best located hotel on the lake. It overlooks Bled Island and has direct access to the lake from the stairway at the front of the villa. It is however one of the more expensive options in Lake Bled at around 250 euros per night. Cafe Belvedere is the cafe that overlooks Bled Island with an incredible (in my opinion the best) view of the lake. You absolutely must try the Bled Cream cake here! It is to die for. Bled Castle Restaurant is actually a really great option in Bled and has a magnificent view over the lake. Surprisingly, the menu is reasonably priced and offers a great introduction to Slovenian cuisine. Public & Vegan Kitchen Bled is the best place for vegetarian and vegan food in Bled. It came as a surprise to me to find such great vegan food here in Lake Bled! The vegan burgers are huge and really tasty. Pr1mo Tours is the best tour company for outdoors adventure sports. They rent out mountain bikes, e-bikes and organise activities like kayaking in the black hole or joining a tour to Triglav national park. If you have your own car I would recommend taking yourself to locations in Triglav, however if you are relying on public transport or travelling solo, joining a tour for the day is always a fun idea. If you are staying in Lake Bled for more than two days you will eventually tire of lake activities and be looking to venture elsewhere (and even if you don’t, you should!) There is so much to see in the area beyond Lake Bled, a few are the top highlights: Vintgar Gorge can be reached in just 10 minutes by car. The gorge is a 1.6 kilometre stretch of water and boardwalks that criss cross their way through the gorge. It is a beautiful place to visit and costs 10 euros. Triglav National Park is full of great day hikes if you’re feeling up for something a little more adventurous. You can self-drive and take your own hike or join a tour like those offered by pr1mo tours (above). Lake Bohinj is a great alternative to Lake Bled and a much quieter experience. Here you can enjoy al the same lake activities a little further off the beaten path.  Enjoy your visit to Lake Bled!"
193,"Paris has my heart. No matter how many times I visit I fall in love all over again. This year I ticked something off my Paris bucket list I have been thinking about for years – staying in a Paris Perfect Apartment. I first heard about this exclusive collection of decked out Parisian apartments with views of the Eiffel Tower from my friend and author Kat Lawrence (she wrote one of my favourite Paris books – Paris Dreaming) and have been myself dreaming of staying ever since. Once I had decided this was the trip that I would finally make my dream of living inside a Parisian apartment a reality, the tough choice began: which apartment to choose!? The Paris Perfect website has so many beautiful apartments to choose from that my toughest decision was choosing just one. I settled on the St Emilion apartment in the 7th arrondissement, with an incredible close-up view of the Eiffel Tower. This apartment was offering a special discounted rate (the best way to find a discount on these apartments is by booking in low season or signing up for the newsletter and waiting for last minute deals). The apartment was huge, filled with light and of course had the most incredible view of the Eiffel Tower from the living room windows. The windows opened up to a small landing however there was unfortunately no balcony/terrace (a bucket list moment I’ll save for the next trip!) One of the hardest decisions when travelling to Paris for the first time is deciding on an arrondissement. My long time friend and fellow Francophile Faye lived in Paris for some time and wrote an article detailing the best Paris neighbourhoods to stay in and what each arrondissement has to offer. The 7th is of course home to the iron lady herself, the Eiffel Tower. While this apartment and arrondissement has great views of Paris’ most famous icon, it is not the best neighbourhood for restaurants and cafes. However what it lacks in numbers it makes up for in quality, with two of my favourite cafes nearby: Coutume Cafe and Carette Cafe. If you pop by the latter be sure to try their salted caramel macarons (I’ve dubbed them the best in town). Renting an apartment for a short stay in Paris is one of the best ways to experience the city. You come to learn your favourite cafes, bakeries and the familiar walk home after a long day of sightseeing. Here are a few things to note before you book an apartment in Paris: Choose a central location – there is so much to see and do in Paris and the city is vast. Choose a neighbourhood near the attractions you want to visit to take out the time and effort of darting across the city. Consider your arrival time – I landed in Paris on a Sunday but luckily the concierge team (who meet you at the apartment to show you the ropes) work 7 days at Paris Perfect. They do however charge an out of hours fee if you arrive late in the evenings. Split the costs – Many of the apartments I shortlisted before choosing mine were 2 bedrooms and some even 3 bedrooms. If you can visit with friends or family, the price of the apartment reduces dramatically!  The WOW Guide to Paris "
194,"Of all the towns I have visited in my travels, I often find those that stick with me most are the quintessential, fairy tale towns in Europe. Not only do they look as pretty as a postcard, but I have also found that these towns have a way of transporting you to another time and place… quite literally as if you had stepped foot into a fairy tale picture book and exited the real world. As I have made this somewhat of a goal over the past few years to continue finding places that teleport you elsewhere, I’ve made quite the collection of fairy tale towns below. I promise you that if you visit one, two, or all of them… you won’t be disappointed! One of the first fairy tale towns I visited in Europe was Bled in Slovenia. I had seen images of this picturesque lake and immediately wanted to transport there. The lake is understandably the biggest attraction in the town, with plenty of water activities on offer like hiring a row boat for an hourly rate (an activity that revealed my shortcomings in the sport). Read more: The most romantic lake in the world; Lake Bled One of the more recent towns I fell in love with has long been on my radar, but only a couple of months ago did I finally make my way to the most gorgeous French town; Colmar. Words can’t even describe the charm of this place — I’m telling you, you can’t make this stuff up! Another French town visited on the same trip to France hasn’t been on my radar for nearly as long, but I think (and I can’t believe I’m saying this), it is my favourite town in all of France and perhaps even Europe! If that doesn’t give you any more reason to go, I don’t know what will. wink Read more: The Cutest town in France! Why you must visit Annecy On my first solo trip to Europe I had my heart and travel plans set on visiting Hallstatt, a small lakeside town in Austria… not too far from Salzburg. It turns out this town is a little trickier to visit, especially if you’re short on time, so I’d suggest reading the post below if the picture makes you want to jump right in (to the picture, of course, ‘cos the lake would be quite cold I should imagine). Read more: Austria’s best kept secret: How to visit Hallstatt Stop. Everything. Now. Isn’t this place just so idyllic!?!? If you’re not already on a separate tab loading a flight compare site to book your flight to Italy, let me plead my case for the Amalfi Coast a little further. Positano is hands down the most picturesque town on the coast, although if I’m to be completely transparent there are more enjoyable towns to stay in when visiting the region. Sorrento is a great place to base yourself as it is bigger, has great restaurants, and is your chance to mingle with locals (Positano is a tourist haven an while you will meet other travellers, you won’t meet the locals which would be a shame as they’re so charismatic!) Read more: A Quick Guide to Positano Another little town I found earlier in my travels is gorgeous and still somewhat under the radar town of Gent in Flanders. Belgium gets a bad wrap for some reason (don’t be dismissive of a place until you have actually been), but in my eyes, it is one of the best countries to visit in Western Europe. If you’re into Gent you will also love Brugges, which is also given a place on this list. Read more: 48 Hours in Ghent Some adventures have a way of sticking with you forever and since I constantly reference my trip to Scotland at dinner parties, I suppose it had a lasting impression on me! I travelled throughout the Scottish Highlands in May when the weather is, in full disclosure, miserable. Aside from the weather I really enjoyed my time in Scotland and it is still to this day one of my all-time favourite countries in the whole world. The people are also much more memorable than the food 😉 Read more: The Top 10 Places to Visit in Scotland If I could tell you my biggest travel secret in Europe it would be to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would recommend dragging along a friend or travel buddy for this one, as tourism is still relatively low and as such travel is a little harder here (as it usually is in the East of Europe). Bus transport is the best way to get around the country and believe me when I say the people are some of the loveliest you will meet all over Europe. I can’t wait to return one day soon – Bosnia has my heart! Read more: 10 Reasons to visit Bosnia & Herzegovina Ahhh, Sintra. The gorgeous little town just a short drive away from Portugal’s capital; Lisbon. I only had a few hours to explore Sintra and with thick cloud coverage, couldn’t go for that iconic view at the castle. Nevertheless, I really adored this city and its’ colourful buildings lining the hillside. This is a great day trip from Lisbon when matched with Cascais. Read more: Mystical Sintra and Charming Cascais For a really (really, really, really) long time “Krumlov” as it is affectionately known to locals, was my favourite small town in all of Europe. Over the years the secret has gotten out on a large scale, so nowadays I find it a little overrun by crowds. The best way to avoid this is to visit during winter and cross your fingers for a thick layer of puffy snow! Read more: The cutest town you ever did see: Why you must visit Cesky Krumlov Probably my favourite location in England is to travel (by road trip) through the Cotswolds. This area of England is a time warp of sorts, with gorgeous thatched houses, small lakes, cute gift stores and really lovely people. I’d recommend spending a few nights in the area so you can visit numerous towns. Read more: Visiting the Cotswolds In many ways my trip to Ireland was my favourite “me time” adventure. I rented a car, hit the open road, and spent way too many hours singing to the radio as I rolled around Ireland from one town to the next. While Ireland is absolutely bursting with cute towns to visit, it is hard to go past Cong. Isn’t the picture tempting you already!? Read more: 8 Places you Must Visit in Ireland Image: F1online digitale Bildagentur GmbH / Alamy Of all the countries left on my list to travel I believe Norway is a strong contender for most desirable. Because the small fishing village called Reine is so idyllic and mesmerising, I just couldn’t leave it out. There is perhaps no single place I want to teleport to more… who’s coming with me!? Image: Harvey Barrison  Last but never least, I don’t think this list would be complete without another gorgeous Italian coastal town – this time a little further north in Cinque Terre. World of Wanderlust contributor Faye headed there last summer to catch a glimpse of why this is one of Italy’s most sought after holiday destinations – drool!!!

195,"I was looking for hidden gems around six years ago when I visited Bosnia & Herzegovina. I had already visited the likes of Paris, London and Rome, so I was searching for something less known when I stumbled upon Mostar. This small city in the South of Bosnia and Herzegovina has now become one of the most sought after destinations in the Balkans. Despite its popularity during the summer months with tourists in Dubrovnik visiting for a day trip, outside of summer it is relatively peaceful. Here are my highlights to help you plan your visit in this complete guide to Mostar. In the centre of the Old Town is the Old Bridge (Stari Most), a picturesque structure that connects both sides of the old town. In summer it hosts the popular bridge jumping competition with locals and tourists alike. Be sure to head across the bridge as on the eastern bank of the bridge you will find the more interesting Muslim part of town. The west on the other hand, is mostly home to the Catholic Croats. The bridge of Stari Most is therefore a sobering reminder of the divide and difficulty this country has faced. While today Bosnia & Herzegovina is peaceful, the past is not forgotten. Throughout the city you can find constant reminders of the war with “Don’t Forget” written in stones. There is one at the entrance to the Stari Most Bridge to remind visitors of the bridge’s collapse during the siege of Mostar. The stones remain to serve a reminder of the Bosnian War. When I was In Sarajevo, I struggled to see remnants of the war that took place from 1991-1995. However in Mostar much of the city reflects the war and serves to remind people to never forget. Over in the Western Town above the Stari Most Bridge lies a War Photo Exhibition. The exhibition is home to 50 images from the Bosnia War. It will cost just 3 euros to enter and I found this to be a really captivating look back at Bosnia’s past. If you are a looking to understand this country on a deeper level, I would highly recommend a visit! The alleys near to the bridge are filled with trinkets and treasures. If you are looking for an authentic souvenir to take home from your travels, this is a great place to find it. Be sure to follow the narrow staircase that leads up to the Koski Mehmed-Pasha Mosque’s minaret. Here you will find panoramic views of the city. If you are shopping for souvenirs in Mostar, you might consider some of these handmade trinkets from one of the vendors near the Old Bridge: Handicrafts made from bullets – After the Bosnian war ammunition was littered throughout the country. Some clever locals collected the used ammunition and have turned them in to a variety of quirky souvenirs. War paraphernalia – Speaking of the war, there are many chances to purchase helmets, badges, knives and all manner of ex-war paraphernalia to take home. Pointy slippers – Perhaps my favourite souvenir to buy in Bosnia was the house slippers used by Bosnians. When entering their home, Bosnians remove both their shoes and socks. Thus it has become common practice to wear house slippers. If you are visiting Mostar for longer than a day, you may wish to venture elsewhere in Bosnia. As beautiful as Mostar is, there are some other less visited cities and attractions nearby. Blagaj is a great place to start as it is a mere ten minutes by car. It is here you can visit the famous Blagaj Tekija, a Dervish monastery built in to the cliff. Read more: How to Visit the Blagaj Tekke in Bosnia Another great day trip should you have more time is to visit Počitelj, Čapljina. This town is just a a short 32 kilometre drive from Mostar. The hillside village is commonly regarded as one of the most beautiful photographic locations in Bosnia. Best of all, not many tourists know about it! I visited this town with my local host who insisted he had a secret location "
196,"I’m sure by now you have all figured out that I absolutely adore Paris and all things French. There’s just some element of decadence that lures me in, which has over time convinced me that I must have been French in another lifetime. And when it comes to luxury hotels in Paris, I have a soft spot for sure. So on my most recent visit to Paris with my other half, we stopped by the Hôtel Plaza Athénée for a fancy afternoon tea, so that I could indulge my sweet tooth and show off one of my favourite hotels in Paris. Of course, we weren’t staying here (it is rather pricey), but I jumped at the chance to take a personalised tour of the hotel when offered. Thus I’d love to share with you some snaps behind the facade, a new series I’ll be starting on World of Wanderlust to show you some of the most stunning hotel interiors around the world!  Each room category has its own unique flair, but to my surprise the higher price brackets don’t necessarily mean more stylish! If you’re after a certain colour code or theme, I’d suggest requesting particular room types at the time of booking, as each room is distinctly different from the next (my favourite is the purple colour palette!)  You can also view the hotel’s famous inner courtyard by stepping inside the lobby and wandering through (you will spot it almost immediately). In the warmer months you can enjoy Afternoon Tea here, or enjoy the view of the courtyard from inside whilst sipping on your Earl Grey!  Room categories get more expensive depending on size and view (can you honestly beat a balcony with that view!?!?) The fresh flowers make this hotel even more impressive in the Spring, my all time favourite time of year to visit Paris!  And the afternoon tea? Divine! This hotel skips the savouries altogether (dangerous, but right up my alley!) The entire setting is sweets, sweets, and more sweets!  Book your stay with Booking.com to save on nightly rates."
197,"Tucked neatly away on the shores of the Bay of Kotor lies Palazzo Radomiri, one of the oldest villa style hotels in the area. Family owned and operated, this luxury hotel has a home away from home feel to it and the minute I arrived I could tell this was going to be a special stay. Palazzo Radomiri lies exactly half way between Kotor and Perast, the two most picturesque small towns in the area. Both are worth a visit and very unique in their own right, so this hotel is a great choice for travellers wishing to visit the towns and yet enjoy peace and quiet away from the crowds. As I was shown to my suite the first thing I noticed was the view of the bay below, right from my living room window. There are a range of different room categories on offer however if you can afford the extra I would highly recommend opting for a waterfront view. This makes for the perfect way to wake up in the morning and check the weather before your adventure begins. Boka Bay is the winding bay of the Adriatic Sea in the southwest of Montenegro. It has become Montenegro’s crowning jewel in tourism and upon visiting, it isn’t hard to see why. Palazzo Radomiri occupies an 18th century villa that has been lovingly restored by the owners who have sourced antiques and trinkets from their own travels to adorn each room individually. There is a daily yoga class offered in the mornings and during the warmer months this takes place on the hotel’s private jetty, right beside the bay. This was the perfect way to wake up each morning and get my body moving, as well as hoping and praying for sunny skies! Room rates start at €140 per room, per night. The hotel is rated four stars and is the perfect blend between a luxurious getaway and a home away from home. The service and on site facilities make it feel as if you are visiting a long lost family member or old friend. Book your stay directly through the Palazzo Radomiri website. A warm thank you to Anna for welcoming me to stay at Palazzo Radomiri this May. All opinions and photos are my own!"
198,"Having visited Florence a number of times (that city is just too darn beautiful not to return when given the chance), on this trip to Italy I was on a mission to explore more of the Tuscan region in the North of Italy – both in towns & their distinct cultures. Travelling South from Florence, I soon arrived in the medieval town of Siena – a city so well preserved that it feels like a time warp of sorts, surely convincing other visitors, not just myself, that we have stepped back a few centuries to truly see what life must have been like in medieval times. As pretty as a film set, Siena soon revealed itself to be much more than a postcard city steeped in history – but also home to very proud people, evident through conversation, street cleanliness, and food offerings (this is Italy after all!) To aid in making the most of your visit to Siena, here is a complete but Quick Guide to Siena!  Before its final defeat by Florence, Siena was an independent city-state brought to wealth through successful banking. Whilst all Italians are known for keeping a strong hand on longstanding traditions, the Sienese keep one particular tradition very close to their hearts, known as the Palio race, conducted each year in summer. The race attracts locals and tourists alike for an incredible festival-like experience where neighbourhoods of Siena race against one another in the Piazza del Campo. However the race is not in any way put on for tourists visiting, as it is to this day taken very serious by locals (so be prepared for a little chaos and an abundance of crowds!)  At the centre of town you will find Piazza del Campo, a uniquely round-shaped piazza which hosts the twice annual Palio race (in summer time). From here you are within walking distance to all of the attractions listed below, and will find it is near impossible to drive within the city, so best to park outside and make a day of it exploring the sights on foot! Located on the Piazza del Campo is this historical building which served as the City Hall of Siena for more than 800 years. Be sure not to miss Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s famous frescos displaying “good and bad government” and if you dare, begin the climb to the top of the Torre del Mangia! There are more than 400 steps to reach the top, but the views over the city are said to be incredible (no, I did not dare!).  Another sight for the eyes is the mesmerising Siena Duomo. The facade of the cathedral is incredibly intricate and full of detail, however the interior is yet another marvel in itself. The black and white striped columns give this cathedral a luxurious feel, with no expense spared in displaying the historical wealth of Siena. Be sure not to miss “The Library” room for an incredible ceiling (pictured below). For the art lovers out there, you’ll find a full collection of national works inside the Pinacoteca Nazionale. This museum shares the history of Siena, with a specific focus on late medieval and Renaissance works. As banking has been so prominent in creating such a thriving city as powerful as Siena, you might find it interesting to visit the Palazzo Salimbeni, built in 1472 and the headquarters for the banking corporation responsible for Siena’s great wealth and prosperity. Even if you don’t enter the building itself, the exterior is well worth a visit! If you happen to chance your visit over the running of the Palio race (twice in summer), it would be a shame not to witness the event! Tourists should be aware that this is by no means a show for tourists – the crowds are large and often chaotic, so prepare yourself for the action! Another great summer event is to attend the Siena Jazz Festival. Even if you don’t like (or think you like) Jazz music, it is well worth experiencing for the atmosphere! If you dare, you could climb the 400+++ steps to the top of the city tower – but with so many steps it is most certainly not for the faint hearted!  To get a full taste of Tuscany (both literally and figuratively), an absolute must experience for the region is to visit a local winery. Just outside of Siena you will find a wide variety of wineries – best to ask a local where you’ll find your preferred wines and go from there (after all, spontaneity is all part of the adventure!) During my time in Siena I had a great range of Sienese food typical to the region. As a vegetarian, my favourite was the bruschetta! I also found Sienese almond cookies to be delicious and of course you MUST try panforte!!! For the foodies out there, be sure to wander beyond the city walls and visit nearby Montestigliano Olive Estate. Trust me when I say it will be a lunch to remember! Highlights of Italy – Where to visit in Tuscany You can’t go to Florence & not see these 20 attractions A Quick Guide to Pisa A Quick Guide to San Gimignano I flew to Tuscany on a direct route with Qatar Airways. Flying from Australia, this meant just two flights to reach the Tuscan region: Melbourne – Doha & Doha – Pisa. I would highly recommend this route for travellers interested in basing their trip in Tuscany, a region that warrants at least one, but up to three weeks to discover. With thanks to Qatar Airways for welcoming me to experience Tuscany on this new direct route!"
199,"Europe is filled with endless explorations to be had, especially in the warmer months when travellers from all over the world make their way to the Mediterranean and beyond for island adventures. Here’s a list of the best islands in Europe to make your way through on your travels this year and for years to come – there are plenty to make your way through!  The idyllic and highly photographed Santorini is considered by most as the most beautiful of all the Greek islands – though with so many great islands to choose from that would be a hard call to make! The iconic white houses cling to the cliff sides of the island and overlook the ocean below. Topped off with bright blue doors and friendly locals, this is one of the best islands to immerse yourself in during the warmer months. Although only small in size, Hvar is one of the most charming island cities to find yourself in in the Balkans. Located in Croatia, Hvar is home to terracotta-roofed houses with a bright blue backdrop of the ocean meeting the clear skies. Bliss! If you find yourself in the Amalfi Coast of Italy, you really can’t go all that way and not make your way over to the island of Capri by ferry. Just a short boat ride away and full of idyllic Italian charm, Capri is commonly regarded as one of the top island destinations in Europe. Located in Spain, Tenerife is a little different to the other islands mentioned thus far, as it is complete with a green mountainous backdrop and mostly empty, wide beaches. Located in Greece, Zakynthos is home to an exposed cave that is regarded as one of Europe’s best beaches with crystal blue waters, a large cliff face, and many opportunities to explore both on land and at sea.  Also regarded as one of the best Greek islands to visit on vacation, Mykonos is more renowned for the ongoing (and sometimes never-ending) party atmosphere amongst a younger crowd. Majorca (Mallorca) is yet another Mediterranean island necessary to visit at least once in your life, complete with limestone mountains, many beach resorts and a much quieter atmosphere to relax in. Corfu Island is a great option for travellers who wish to see and do more on their trip rather than laze around on the beach (although there’s plenty of that too!) After being held under Italian, French and British rule (now a part of Greece), this island is rich in both history and culture. Here’s an island where you can come to hike the rugged landscape and spend days afterwards on the pristine beaches relaxing. Located just 10 kilometres from the mainland of Tuscany (Italy), Elba can be enjoyed in just a few days and is easy enough to reach to not be too far out of the way.  The isle of Skye in Scotland might not be your usual island getaway but it is certainly a charming one all the same! If you’re looking for somewhere to head in the shoulder season (Spring), the Isle of Skye offers great outdoors activities and scenery to explore. Another island in the Mediterranean worth visiting and noticeably more low key than its neighbours (Ibiza and Majorca), Minorca is a great alternative if your idea of a holiday is to relax, swim, and soak up the sunshine. If you find yourself in the Amalfi coast, a visit over to Ischia is not only entirely possible, but extremely popular for visitors to the area. Spain’s Canary Islands are popular among locals and visitors alike, one of the most popular being Gran Canaria. This is also a popular stopover for cruise ships (in the northern capital – Las Palmas), so be sure to avoid this area if you’re looking to relax and unwind! Spain is full of idyllic islands to visit for a beachy getaway, Formentera being one of those. It is most popularly known for its clear waters, white sand and long coastline.  If you’re up for something a little more lively, Ibiza is arguably the most popular party island in Europe throughout the summer season. Be sure you’re up for it – Ibiza has a reputation it certainly lives up to! If the summer season isn’t really your thing (be that for the heat or the crowds – or a combination of both), there are many great options in the North that are a completely different island experience – less sunshine but fantastic all the same! For great hikes and scenery, Lewis & Harris in Scotland is a great option. Although not nearly as talked about as its counterparts, Skiathos has a thriving nightlife scene with waterfront clubs, al fresco dining and a gorgeous main town that is quite literally as pretty as a picture. Located in the Dalmatia region of Croatia is the unique and sprawling Mljet island. Almost the entire island is covered in lush green forests, though the small villages make up for in charm what they lack in size. This island in the Adriatic Sea is one of the most stunning locations to find yourself in Croatia. Brač is home to the iconic Zlatni Rat, a white pebble beach that peers out onto a narrow face of the island and attracts many beach goers in the warmer months."
200,"This series has been really fun so far and its about to get even funner with a trip to Barcelona – the crowning jewel of Catalania! With oodles of colour and charm around every turn, there is so much to see here that you will almost certainly want to return. If you have just a few days in Barcelona then get ready to hit the ground running as there is so much for you to see, do, eat and drink here in Gaudi’s city! This is our complete Barcelona bucket list.  To revitalise from the flight (any excuse will do) head straight for Boqueria Market and score yourself a 2 euro (give or take) fresh juice. There are plenty of goodies to stock up on here but the fresh juice is outta this world!  While museums are great, no museum in the world could trump the open air museum that is Barcelona – filled with the artistic creations of Gaudi himself. The city is quite literally filled with his magnificent works, but you could begin with: La Pedrera, Casa Vicens and Casa Batlló. Understanding Picasso’s connection to Barcelona will explain much that there is to know about Picasso’s formative years. The museum is open every day except Mondays; 9am-7pm.  Undeniably one of the best things you can do with your time in Barcelona is eat as there is SO much great food to get through whilst you’re here! Tapas are the preferred food item of choice, as they will allow you to eat small portions and subsequently make your way through many flavours and dishes on offer. The best idea to guarantee great food is to enjoy a local tapas walking tour one evening – you won’t regret it!  Arguably the most iconic image of Barcelona in the days of social media is Park Güell. This public park overlooks the city and features some of Gaudi’s most impressive works (though be sure to check out many more across the city!) Sangria is a popular drink in Spain and one taste of the deep-purple fruity drink will soon show you why! This delicious beverage is a combination of red wine, chopped fruit, a sweetener and brandy. Delicious!  Just. Go. Seriously. This Basilica would have to be one of the most impressive in Europe – the architecture is just beyond what words can describe! If you’re looking for somewhere to spend a few hours with ample photographic opportunities, then make your way over to the gothic quarter and wander the endless streets for all the inspiration one could ever need.  As the main thoroughfare street in Barcelona, La Rambla is full of entertainment, shopping, great eats, and lots of little hidden gems off the main street. Although its origins are Italian, this Catalanian style Cannelloni deserves a title of its own. Find it at Cervecería Catalana.  If you’re dying for a Sunday stroll or just want to escape the hustle and bustle of Barcelona for a short while, head on over to Parc de la Ciutadella for a lush, green wonderland. There’s also a zoo! Looking for another great view over the city that is entirely free? Head over to Montjuïc.  Okay so technically this has already been mentioned (its another one of Gaudi’s fabulous creations), but it deserves its own mention as it really is such a sight – you cannot miss it! If you want to get a little insight into local culture, then book yourself into an evening Flamenco show — so much fun!  If you’re looking to get out of the city for a day then a trip to Montserrat is incredibly worthwhile. As the most popular day trip from Barcelona you’ll be joined by many others, but the views from this peak are incredible! Still want more? Follow along on Instagram for more!"
201,"My recent visit to Norway confirmed what I already knew to be true: this is one of the most picturesque countries in the world, full of jaw-dropping scenery and postcard-perfect towns. Whilst travelling along the Norwegian coasts, I came to realise that there was much to be discovered by way of charming little towns and sizeable cities, so here are the prettiest coastal cities and towns in Norway you have to visit! Let’s start with an obvious choice and a much-loved city by all who travel to Norway: Bergen. Despite being full of small-town charm, Bergen is in fact the second-largest city in Norway. The beauty of this city centres around Bryggen, a UNESCO World Heritage site. This focuses on a historic harbour lined with quintessential seaside buildings in quirky colours. Be sure to wander behind the buildings for a free history lesson! It is here you will find great art studios and galleries. There is a strong sense of supporting locals artisans, which is prominent in Scandinavian culture. As my all-time favourite town in Norway, I fell completely and utterly in love with Ålesund. This seaside town was all but completely destroyed in a fire at the beginning of the 20th Century. It was then completely rebuilt in Art Nouveau style after the fire. The most enjoyable aspect of this town is just wandering the city streets. There are many great antique stores and local artisans. Be sure to climb the 418 steps to the public viewing platform for the most incredible view over the city! It is best to do this in the afternoon and capture the golden hues.  As the fourth largest city in Norway, Stavanger brings a whole lot of small-town charm. The old town is a must-visit, complete with traditional wooden houses and their charming miniature gardens on display. Over in the city centre itself, you will still find oodles of charm in the many winding streets and alleyways that make up the shopping district. A half-day visit is plenty of time to soak up all the charm in this town, combined with a hike in the nearby fjords to complete your stay! Commonly regarded as Norway’s most scenic fjord and one of the most incredible landscapes in the world, a visit to Geiranger (village) and Geirangerfjord should be on any and all traveller’s visit list whilst in Norway. The landscapes are best viewed as you wind your way up the narrow road that connects Geiranger with the rest of the region, open only a few months of the year during summer. Then in late September the road closes to make way for the heavy snowfall. This list would not be complete without mention of the small fishing village known as Flåm (pronounced: Flaum). This is of course where you can take the hour long Flåm Railway, commonly regarded as one of the most scenic railways in Europe. Be sure to take the time to wander around the water’s edge and see the village from afar – a photograph just waiting to happen! Image via Flickr / Mashhour Halawani Over on Norway’s southern coast lies Oslo, the capital of Norway and largest city with more than 600,000 Norwegians calling this city home! If you’re after more of a city escape or are arriving in Norway by plane, you absolutely must stop by Oslo to see the hustle and bustle. No other city in Norway feels as busy or happening as Oslo, with a wide range of concerts and events year-round to make your visit extra special! Image via Wikicommons Back on the west coast of Norway is a small and unassuming little town known as Haugesund. This is a great base for more adventurous travellers planning to hike the Lysefjorden region, which is regarded as one of the best regions to explore many of Norway’s most spectacular mountains."
202,"The Ritz Escoffier is one of Paris’ best-kept secrets. If you have ever pictured yourself in the heart of Paris in an underground kitchen making your French pastry chef dreams a reality, then you’ll want to sign yourself up for a pastry class at the Ritz hotel in Paris. Yup, your pastry dreams are about to come true!  Prior to discovering the pastry classes on offer at the Ritz Escoffier I had been to a few pastry classes elsewhere in Paris and was eager to learn some new techniques as well as explore the world-famous hotel and its’ kitchens. As it turns out the Ritz Escoffier is a completely separate area of the basement, dedicated entirely to cooking classes of French classic dishes and refined French pastries.  The course I enrolled for was a four-hour long lesson in entremets (dessert). We made a delicious chocolate hazelnut gâteau and learned the intricacies of French pastry along the way. Many of the classes are offered in French so be sure to be aware when booking your class. The class I booked for was available only in French however there was a sous chef on hand to translate the class in to English – what a saviour!  After the class I realised I now had an entire glazed cake on my hands and would struggle to eat even a sizeable portion, so I chose to donate the cake to the staff at my hotel (and earned myself a lot of smiles and brownie points in doing so!) There are many great patisseries in Paris on almost every corner, however if you’re a pastry nutter like me, you’ll want to check out these stand out stores: Carette – My favourite macaron in Paris. Try the gigantic salted caramel macaron for a jolly good time. Pierre Herme – Of course the indisputable macaron master. I like to try his rotation of seasonal flavours that are quite often very out of the ordinary. Du Pain et des Idées – The best traditional pastries in all of Paris if you ask me! The most reliable source of a croissant or pan au chocolat.  If you’re looking to take some of your newfound skills home with you then be sure to drop by E. Dehillerin to pick up all your pastry supplies. From piping nozzles to copper pots, there’s everything you will ever need inside. 18-20 Rue Coquillière, 75001 Paris, France  To book a class at the Ritz Escoffier, simply visit their online booking system. There are only very select dates on offer and many of the classes book out so I would recommend booking in advance wherever possible. The classes are much more expensive than other classes in Paris but very well run and you can learn a lot of advanced techniques beyond what you can learn elsewhere. Price: €165 Book: via the Ritz Escoffier"
203,"As the gateway to so many fantastic locations in the countryside of France, Lyon is an impressive city with many great pockets to discover. With a surprisingly good restaurant and cafe scene, Lyon is best discovered over a couple of days, though if you’re light on time, can be ticked off in a day of jam-packed adventures. My visit was that of the latter and went by in a flash! Here is our complete city guide to Lyon to help plan your own adventure! Many visitors to Lyon arrive by train but no matter the mode of transport – get yourself to the centre of town and have your map handy – this city is huge and has so much to discover! Because of the sheer size, I’d highly recommend renting a bike for the day or making use of the city bikes. This will enable you to cover so much more ground, as many of the cities’ offerings are spread out. If cycling isn’t your thing, you can still see most of Lyon’s highlights on foot – but be ready for a big day clocking up the kilometres! Being such a huge city, there is plenty to see and do in Lyon. While a couple of days will see you explore the city at leisure, the best of Lyon can certainly be seen in one day. Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière A beautiful basilica overlooking the city with a really great view. Vieux Lyon (Old Town) The old town district is by far and large my favourite area to explore and I’m sure it will be yours, too. This quaint and charming neighbourhood is best explored on foot (think cobblestones and lots of them!) There are many charming restaurants and bakeries to be found amongst the souvenir shops and artisan stores. Parc de la Tête d’or If you find yourself in Lyon during the warmer months, then a picnic lunch in this beautiful 117 hectare public park is a must. Museums There are a handful of popular museums in the city (I can’t say I visited any because with just one day, being outside exploring was my priority!) The most popular are the Museum of Fine Arts and the Gallo-Roman Museum, exhibiting a range of Roman artefacts and antiques. Lyon has an impressive food and drinks scene, with something on the menu for even the pickiest of eaters. I managed to find a great range of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free friendly eateries as well, so read on for a (very) comprehensive list! Slake Coffee House – The best coffee in town (and great carrot cake too!) Puzzle Cafe – Also the best coffee in town (qual standing) with a really relaxed “BYO Laptop” kinda vibe. La Cafeteria – Great healthy and affordable lunch spot and really popular with the locals. Le Polo Club – Cosy little tea room with a British feel – custom teapots and all! Le Grand Café des Négociants – Over the top, luxurious setting with a classic approach to brunch (think French pastries, OJ and plunger coffee). Le Kitchen Cafe – Only 19 seats and arguably the most sought after spot in town. Here you will find a dessert bar (uh, yes!). Open for lunch only. Cafe Sillon – Focus on fresh produce and an ever-changing seasonal menu. Les Apothicaires – Four, five and six course dinners with a distinctly French approach to modern gastronomy. An awakening dining experience if ever there were just one to be had in Lyon. Hank Vegan Burgers – Third location of the popular eatery from Le Marais, Paris. This is vegan junk food at its finest. Against the Grain – Vegan cafe with really great soups, salads, wraps and light fare. Toutes Les Couleurs – Fusion dining and fully vegan restaurant for a more refined evening meal. Boulangerie du Palais – Arguably the best in town. Be sure to try the local Brioche aux Pralines (sweet bread filled with pralines). Patisserie Taffin – Delicate French pastries with a traditional approach. Piece of Cake! – Your American-style baking goodies are all here in this simple approach to homestyle baking. Vienne – Very nearby small city with well-preserved Roman ruins. 30km South of Lyon. Pérouges – Small medieval town that is used as the set to many films (because it is that cute it looks like a film set!) 40km from Lyon. Domaine de Lacroix-Laval – Beautiful estate with manicured gardens and an impressive conservatory. 13km from Lyon. I visited Lyon as part of an Avalon Waterways River Cruise – which is a great way to see the highlights of Provence and Burgundy in a week sailing! All opinions and oodles of photos are my own! "
204,"For years I’ve been dreaming of a white Christmas in Europe and finally this year I made my way to Central Europe to do just that. It was on my second day in Prague that I opened my window to snow – and not just a little snow – snowflakes on snowflakes were falling out of the sky and in to my hands… if that is not Christmas magic, I do not know what is! Below I’ve written a complete list of the 10 best things to do for Christmas in Prague – from the best Christmas market in Prague through to the Christmas treats you must try!     Christmas Markets and Europe in December go hand in hand, so make sure you wear your comfortable shoes and get ready to hit the ground running in Prague – there are Christmas stalls and markets dotted around the city. If you’re looking for the most scenic Christmas Market and prefer to just visit one then make sure you don’t miss a visit to the Old Town Square Christmas Market and be sure to make your way up to the top of the Old Town Tower for a view from above!  When I made a call out on Instagram stories to see what Czech foods I could not miss at Christmas, almost every response included Trdelník. This popular Czech dessert is a hollowed out pastry dough covered in cinnamon sugar and now popularly topped with soft serve ice cream. You can find a whirlwind of flavour combinations at the Good Food Coffee and Bakery at 8 Karlova (the main street that connects Charles Bridge and the Old Town Square).  I would argue the only thing more magical than Prague in December is Prague at night time in December, as the whole city lights up in an amber glow with the combination of Christmas lights and the cities’ usual radiance! Take a stroll from the Prague Dancing House down to the Charles Bridge for magical views like the photo I took on my evening walk above.  The view from the Old Town Tower is one of the best ways to see the city from above at any time of year, but at Christmas it is especially beautiful as you can see the Christmas markets and their happenings from a birdseye view. The ticket price is around 9 euros and if you’re not feeling like the exercise, there’s the option to take the lift to the top.  When you make your way from the Old Town Square to the Castle and Castle Hill, be sure to stop to visit the swans as you arrive on the castle side of the Vltava River. These beautiful creatures are very people friendly – just be sure to give them plenty of space!  Another great view can be had atop the Charles Bridge Tower, though I learned from experience to not leave it too late in the day (during December the sun sets a little earlier than 4pm!)  Once you’ve walked across the Charles Bridge, be sure to make your way to Castle Hill and take in the sweeping views of the city. Here is one of the best views of Prague on a clear day and there are a handful of Christmas market stalls at the top of the hill.  While you’re darting around town from Christmas Market to Christmas Market, be sure to indulge in all of the food and wine at your disposal. Svařák is the Czech take on English mulled wine or German gluhwein, however with a stronger touch of lemon and citrus flavours to balance out the sugars.  x  The Vrtba garden is one of my favourite secrets in Prague but in winter they are closed to the public. The only way to see them from October-April is from one of the garden-facing rooms at Hotel Aria, one of my favourite hotels in Prague and what feels like a home away from home!"
205,"I dunno about you guys but for me, there’s something exciting about a new year of adventures… the endless possibilities of where I might end up, who I’ll meet along the way and what will come of another year globetrotting. Because I’m absolutely certain I am European in another lifetime (aside from eating dinner after 8:00 pm – ever), I’ve put together a comprehensive list of 20 places that will absolutely take your breath away Europe. These are the “bucket list” cities and towns, the “once in a lifetime” experiences and for sure, they’re all honeymoon approved. So here they are… the most breathtaking places to visit in Europe!  We’ll start with an obvious choice and a place I have been harping on about since the first time I laid eyes on it; Positano, a coastal town on the idyllic Amalfi Coast in Italy. Positano is nestled in the cliffside of the jaw-dropping Amalfi coast, far enough away that you’ll find it an effort to reach but close enough to make the area a whole trip in itself. Surrounding Positano you have the Isle of Capri, nearby Sorrento (which I’d also highly recommend), Ravello and Amalfi itself. Each of these towns deserve a couple of days attention, but suffice it to say Positano is the one that will take your heart hook, line and sinker. Read more: Where to Honeymoon in Italy Read more: The Amalfi Coast Map & Towns to Visit  Its no secret that I adore Belgium and still believe it is one of the most underrated, overlooked countries to visit in Western Europe. Before travelling to Belgium for the first time I was warned it would be “boring”, “expensive” and “not worth my while”. Wrong, wrong, wrong again. Belgium is full of quaint little charming cities/towns and that is most evident in the city of Bruges.  If it is good enough for Clooney, it has sure got my interest.  Lake Como in the Northern lakes region of Italy feels like a world away from reality. Small towns, ferry transport, impressive villas and incredible regional cuisine are just the beginning. If ever you feel like you just want to “get away from it all”, here is your opportunity to pass the days lakeside, surrounded by colourful blooms and even more colourful locals. Read more: 10 Lakes in Europe you Must Visit  As a whole the country of Bosnia & Herzegovina is often overlooked. While many travellers pass by to visit Mostar on a day trip from nearby Dubrovnik (in Croatia), I can say with absolute certainty that this country deserves much more than a day trip. A few years ago I spent a week with a local family in Blagaj, a small town outside of Mostar. Sure, it was Mostar that first caught my attention but after road tripping around the small country in the Balkan Peninsula, I realised that the beauty lie far beyond the scenery. The hospitality, food, culture and overload of friendship is what made this country so worth visiting. Do yourself a favour and stay a while.  Cesky Krumlov takes centre stage as the Czech Republic’s most charming town and certainly one of Europe’s all-time most loved small town destinations. In the summer time this little town, a short bus ride from Prague, is bursting with travellers from all corners of the globe. However the story is much different in winter when the crowds are long gone, snow often lands on the town and creates a magical winter getaway. Regardless of the season, this town is so charming that it will without a doubt take your breath away. Read more: The 20 Most Charming Places you Must Visit in Europe!  The Cotswolds were on my bucket list for so long that when I actually got there, I felt like I knew the places already. The area itself is in rural England and named after the collection of small towns and estates, built mostly with distinctive local yellow limestone. The area is best enjoyed over a week of road-tripping from town to town through the summer, so be sure to plan on staying a while! Read more: Visiting the Cotswolds, England  Years ago I had the pleasure of visiting Finland, which had long been on my radar thanks to inspiration from the Chronicles of Narnia and my undying desire to find a place so magical in real life. I found just that in Oulanka National Park in the early winter, covered in a layer of snow and slippery ice (I learnt the hard way!) If you are more of an outdoors traveller and looking to go off the grid, Lapland is the perfect setting to do so and a great introduction to typical Finnish culture when you begin to venture more North. Read more: These photos prove Finland should be your next travel destination!  When you think of picture-perfect towns in Europe, Colmar is often one of the first to come to mind. Located on the Eastern border of France to Germany, Colmar has a unique blend of Franco-German architecture, culture and culinary delights. Whilst here be sure to hire a bike and hit the open road – you will find you have endless vineyards and bike trails at your disposal. Read more: 14 Fairy tale Towns in Europe you Must Visit  As far as fairytales go, visiting the one and only “Disney castle” in real life is about as fantastically pinch-yourself as moments come. Europe is full of beautifully restored castles and many of those can be found in Germany. Check out these fairytale castles to visit in Germany if you’re looking to tick a handful off your bucket list! Read more: The Best Castles to Visit in Europe  Budapest is by far one of my all time favourite cities in Europe and has been for the past five years of periodical visits. Although relatively “discovered” nowadays (thanks to a huge influx of expats and tourism boost), I still think Budapest is somewhat underrated. This city has it all – a fascinating history, incredible architecture to rival the likes of Paris, beautiful stately interiors and some of the friendliest locals you will find in a capital city. Believe me when I say this city will steal your heart. Read more: 20 Places you Must Visit in Budapest Read more: The Central Europe Trifecta: Visiting Prague, Vienna & Budapest  Starting from Dublin, I made my way to the West Coast of Ireland by rental car on my first ever visit to the country and have not stopped singing its’ praises ever since. Ireland is everything you imagined it would be – green, rainy, full of charming locals (who, yes, love the pub!) and so much more. One of the best things I have ever done is take a solo road trip through Ireland and suffice it to say it was one of the most jaw-dropping places I have seen in Europe, particularly when reaching the wild, rugged West Coast. Read more: 8 Places you Must Visit in Ireland  I don’t think I ever made it a secret that Portugal’s Algarve is one of my favourite “vacation” destinations in Europe. Somehow the South of Portugal has kept all of its charm in the past couple of decades of globalization and despite being a hot spot for tourists, it still has a strong influx of Portuguese holidaymakers that make it feel like a more authentic coastal getaway (as opposed to say, the likes of Ibiza?) So if you find yourself looking for a summer vacay in Europe I would highly recommend Portugal and its prize possession: The Algarve. Read more: 8 Places you Must Visit in Portugal  After visiting Annecy with my boyfriend last year we both became convinced that there is perhaps no other city or town in Europe quite as charming, picturesque and absolutely breath-taking. This city is full of charm at every turn and to put the icing on the cake, is surrounded by water and water activities every which way you look (hello peddle boating!) Read more: 14 Fairy tale towns in Europe you Must Visit  If you’re a sucker (like me) for the “off-the-beaten-path” description of a place, you will fall head over heels for this small city at the centre of Transylvania, Romania. The town of Brasov is one of my must-visit places in Romania thanks to its proximity to the charming towns and castles nearby, all giving first-timers to Romania an insight into just how beautiful this country is. Read more: Visiting Dracula’s Castle in Transylvania  There’s one trip I would love to live over and over again and that’s my short time in the Scottish Highlands. For some reason (unbeknownst to me), I am obsessed with the culture of Scotland. The traditions, intriguing food and endless history immediately had me wrapped up in a time warp. Plus, you can ride on the Hogwarts Express. YES, you read correct. The real Hogwarts Express. Read more: 10 Places you Must Visit in Scotland  Everyone knows I’m obsessed with St Petersburg (or at least, everyone who has been reading World of Wanderlust for any decent amount of time). Following my obsession with Russian History, I booked a trip to Russia to see everything I studied first hand. I’ve got to say The Hermitage Museum is hands down the most impressive building I have ever stepped foot it, let alone the myriad of collections that line the endless hallways (you could spend weeks in that place and still not see it all). Peterhof was another highlight, particularly in the summertime as the weather allows for a walk through Peter the Great’s mischievous gardens (with “trick” fountains – what a cool guy). If ever there were a city that deserves more recognition as a “must visit” city in Europe, this is it. St Petersburg is up there with Paris and London for me, as one of the all time greats (and Peter would be oh so agreeable). Read more: St Petersburg Bucket list Read more: Moscow Bucket list  I never thought that I would visit Stockholm after hearing from friends about how expensive it is to visit. “Beautiful, but expensive” they would all say in a similar fashion. Then one day when my mum booked a trip to visit me whilst I was living in Berlin, I decided to take her to this very city (splitting the costs) and because ABBA are her all-time life obssession. This city surprised me with its old world charm and yes, the expense was still a rude shock (!!) But all in all I would never take those few days back for anything – this city is a true gem of Scandinavia. Read more: Top 10 Things to do in Stockholm  I read about Lake Bled for years before ever thinking I would visit. It has often been described as the most romantic lake in Europe and to that I would have to agree – picturesque, quiet, serene. If you find yourself travelling with a loved one through central Europe, Lake Bled is a must visit.  Being a beginner skiier at best, I never imaged I would find myself on the slopes of Zermatt – known to be one of Europe’s most impressive ski slopes that crosses from the Swiss Alps in to the Italian Alps. Yup, its that big! But when I did make my way to Zermatt last year with my boyfriend, I was determined to give it a crack and improve my skills (or lack thereof), simultaneously exploring some of the most beautiful surrounds in Switzerland. This trip quite literally took my breath away (as in I ran out of breath, fell over more times than I could count and very nearly camped the night on the mountain to avoid any more bruises) and I would say for any skiiers or ski enthusiasts, this is a must visit location.

It turns out Wales had a similar effect on me as did Ireland – complete and total calmness. I urge you to rent a car, hit the open road and venture off without care or regard for where you end up.

206,"Ireland is full of great cities to explore and Kilkenny is one such city you should add to your itinerary. After spending a few days in Dingle and later Wexford, I made my way over to County Kilkenny in southern Ireland for a few days to explore the city of Kilkenny and surrounding area. Below is a guide to visiting Kilkenny Ireland to help you plan your own visit. For my few days in Kilkenny city I checked in to the gorgeous Lyrath Estate, situated a few kilometres outside of the city itself. The hotel is set around a 17th-Century manor on 170 acres of Irish countryside. Today the hotel is much more modern and a popular wedding venue, so if you’d prefer to stay somewhere with more of a local boutique feel (this hotel is quite large), you should still visit as a day guest to enjoy the famous afternoon tea or make use of the spa facilities. You can pay to use the spa facilities as a day guest or book a treatment and enjoy the spa at the same time. Once you’ve checked in, be sure to make your way over to Kilkenny city for a full day of exploring. This city has plenty to see and do for an action packed day, so plan to start early and visit the Kilkenny castle before the crowds arrive. The doors of the castle open at 9:00am each day and it is open seven days a week. You can choose a guided or self tour, depending on how much time you wish to spend inside the castle. I spent around one hour in the castle and surrounding gardens before making my way onwards to Kilkenny’s Smithwick’s brewery for a tour. Kilkenny castle was built in 1195 and is one of the best kept and most beautiful castles in Ireland. A visit to the castle will also provide you with a great deal of history in to County Kilkenny as well as its importance to the country. The price to enter is 15 euros, though if you would prefer to visit and enjoy the castle from the outside you can walk through the gardens and park free of charge. Be sure to make your way to the fountain at the front of the castle for a great view of the castle in its entirety. If you are staying in the city of Kilkenny and looking for an escape to the countryside, I cannot recommend Mount Juliet highly enough. This estate is a short drive from the city of Kilkenny but feels like an escape in the remote countryside as it is surrounded by land and plenty of it! The afternoon tea at Mount Juliet was the highlight of my visit to the estate. Along with a pot of your tea selection, you will be warmly welcomed with a tall tower of three plates: savoury sandwiches and tarts, homemade scones with clotted cream, jam and lemon curd, as well as the final event: pastries. Back over in Kilkenny there is plenty to see, do and experience beyond the attractions and tourist sites. Be sure to wander the High Street and find a pub that tickles your fancy, pop inside and meet some locals. The pub I most enjoyed was Bridie’s Bar & General Store on John Street. I found this pub by accident and loved the old school vibe inside – plus the added bonus of Frank Sinatra playing in the background! Another huge highlight of my time in Kilkenny was the food. It came as a surprise to me that this city was so full of gastronomic restaurants, great pub food and a huge cafe scene. My favourites are listed below: Zuni – award winning restaurant with degustation menus. Don’t leave without trying dessert! Matt the Millers – really lively pub that is one of the best places in town on a weekend evening. Lady Helen – fancy Michelin star restaurant at Mount Juliet estate. The kind of date night where you wouldn’t be surprised to see a proposal at one of the other tables!  A very warm thank you to Visit Kilkenny for inviting me to experience Kilkenny on this trip to Ireland! All opinions are my own."
207,"Are you travelling to Vienna and want to experience typical Viennese culture but are travelling on a tight budget? Look no further! Here’s how you can attend a night at the incredible Vienna Opera House for just a few euros. That’s right, you don’t have to pay a fortune to visit this famed opera house. Here’s how!  Normally tickets for a night at the Vienna Opera House run for up to and often more than 100 euros. Not only that, but tickets during the busy times (summer and in December for Christmas shows like Hansel and Gretel and the Nutcracker) it is often impossible to even land a ticket despite the cost! So what if I told you there is a way you can see the famous operas and ballets for just a few euros? Of course you would say yes!  For just 3-4 euros you can land yourself a ticket to the Opera in the standing-only section. Be sure to pack your comfortable shoes and plan your visit to arrive a couple of hours in advance (tickets for standing only go on sale 80 minutes before the show – arriving a little before that will mean you can choose a great spot). Just as important as your comfy shoes and spare change to get your standing tickets – you will also need a scarf to attend. A scarf? I hear you ask. Scarves are considered a “hold” of your place along the railing and this will mean you can land the best available standing position if you arrive nice and early. Then with your free time before the show you can grab a drink or a bite to eat in the area (Karlsplatz is very central so there are plenty of options nearby). If you’re looking for something iconic and traditional to do with your time, head next door to Cafe Sacher and sample the original Sacher torte (rich chocolate cake), a must in Vienna!

208,"If there were ever an institution in Paris as dedicated to the sweet life as Angelina, I would love to hear of its existence. Angelina is one of the most renowned tea houses in Paris, having established itself in 1903 and continuing to wow customers and loyal clientele to this day. For more than a century the tea-house has welcome Parisian aristocrats, celebrities, and dedicated sweet enthusiasts through its iconic wooden doors opposite Jardin de Tuileries. Of course nowadays there are a number of Angelina’s throughout Paris and even now in other countries, but nothing comes close to scheduling a rendezvous at the original Angelina itself.  In the summer you will have to patiently wait in a queue just to get in the door (it really is that popular) but in the winter you can not only enjoy less crowds and wait time, but also delight in the winter warmer that the tea house is so famous for: the chocolat chaud.  There’s no denying that Angelina is a cliche: a typically french patisserie in an enviable location and widely recommended by guidebooks and fans alike. However if you’re looking for the best hot chocolate in town, a fantastic pastry selection and are happy to pay more than you should to indulge, then there’s no way you should miss a visit to the famous tea house on your visit to Paris.  Let usbegin with the menu item Angelina is most famous for: the incredibly thick, rich, and somehow not overbearing chocolat chaud à l’ancienne dit “l’Africain” (or simply, the old-fashioned hot chocolate). At 8.20€ a piece it doesn’t come cheap, but the hot chocolate is a dessert in itself and comes with a serving of fresh whipped cream on the side to allow you to sweeten the drink to your liking.  Another classic on the menu is the highly celebrated “Mont Blanc” pastry dessert, which is the dessert Angelina is most famous for (perhaps equally to the chocolat chaud). The dessert describes itself as a meringue with light whipped cream and chestnut cream vermicelli. This is a pretty loose description of what I would like to call an incredibly indulgent, thick consistency, extremely rich dessert which does not leave you any room for hot chocolate. Be sure to choose one or the other (or visit twice) as both the chocolat chaud and mont blanc are incredibly rich and overly infulgent. To dine in you will pay 9.20€ or to take-away 6.90€. If you’re looking for a sweeter and much lighter dessert (although still incredibly indulgent), then you can’t go past the colourful creation known as a Joconde. This dessert consists of a macaron base and top, filled with cream and raspberries. Although it might look light and fresh the dessert is still plentiful, so perhaps better to share! The price is 6.90€ to take away.  Another gorgeous dessert from the pastry selection that caught my eye was the Paris-New York. This dessert considers itself to be a chou pastry with pecan praline light cream and a crunchy pecan praline centre. For those of you with a sweeter tasting palette (and less rich), this would be my dessert of choice. The price is 9€ to dine in or 6.90€ to take away.  Angelina also sell a range of macaron & ice cream flavours, though if you ask me neither of these are much to rave about and you will certainly find better on offer throughout Paris (Carette for macarons & Berthillon for ice cream).  226 rue de Rivoli

209,"When my Dutch book tour concluded (shout out to all who came to the signings!) I made my way to the countryside for a little R&R, checking myself in to the gorgeous St Gerlach Hotel and Chateau. The following three days would be spent walking the gardens, reading my book (currently Paris for One) and checking in to check out for a few days. If you’re looking for a little luxury and to escape city life, here’s a little insight in to my countryside escape!  St Gerlach is located just 20 minutes drive from Maastricht, deep in the South of the Netherlands and near to the border to Belgium (as well as France and Germany). Although not too far from the city, the hotel feels a world away from reality: focusing on luxurious spa retreats, gastronomic restaurants and beautiful gardens to explore. The good news for me was that you could do as much or as little as you like during your stay. As tempting as it was to rent a bicycle or take a vespa for a spin (sadly I lost my licence recently so couldn’t do so), I decided just to kick back, enjoy the countryside and eat my way through the hotel’s offerings.  As the hotel promotes a city escape, it was little wonder they had an incredible indoor pool with a full spa menu to enjoy. There are gardens surrounding the hotel and chateau (which houses the hotel’s restaurant and bistro), so I made it my mission to explore these at great length and enjoy switching off after a week of city living. As I live on a farm back at home in Tasmania, I have a constant desire to switch off and enjoy the outdoors – something I had missed since boarding the plane over a week ago!  The rooms are simple and elegant, decorated in true countryside style. My room was located above reception on level two, giving me a nice view of the winter garden and allowing me the convenience to walk down to breakfast in my sweater before taking a walk around the grounds each morning.  The food was one of the highlights of my time at St Gerlach and believe me when I say the chefs here are world class! Both nights I enjoyed a casual dinner in the bistro, which was much more my style over the fancy fine dining option. The food was exceptional both nights, reasonably priced and with great service. Because of the hotel’s location in the countryside, there aren’t any other dining options nearby. Thus if you would prefer more options it would be wise to rent a car and make the trip in to Maastricht, located just 20 minutes away. The hotel also offers a free shuttle service to and from the city between the hours of 10:00am and 18:00pm.  If you decide to stay at St Gerlach I would highly recommend taking the time to explore nearby Maastricht. As I arrived by train from Utrecht, I left my luggage in the station lockers whilst spending my first day here exploring the city (besides, check-in time is 3pm, so it made sense!) You can also rent bicycles and vespas directly from the hotel, giving you a great excuse to explore the villages nearby or venture over the border into Belgium, France or Germany.   A very large thank you to St Gerlach for welcoming me on this two night retreat! It was a lovely little end to my book tour in the Netherlands. All photos and opinions are my own!"
210,"Visiting the Amalfi Coast has long been on my bucket list but in the lead up to my visit I had absolutely no idea just how magical my time here would be. The area is full of beautiful towns, villages and islands to visit, with Sorrento being the biggest of these beyond Naples, which is considered to be the gateway to the Amalfi. However Sorrento is not a sleepy resort town that only comes to life in the summer, as many locals live here and the town is much more sizeable in comparison to its neighbours. Thus we chose to visit in Spring before the summer season crowds arrived to bring you this guide: How to spend a weekend in Sorrento!  When only the best will do, check yourself in to the Grand Hotel Excelsior Vittoria, one of the finest hotels on the Amalfi Coast and my preferred choice in Sorrento. From the minute you arrive you can feel the difference of a family run hotel that has stayed within the same family for centuries, since 1834. The hotel is centrally located with an entrance at Piazza Tasso and an exit via a private lift directly to the port, making it effortless to catch a ferry to nearby destination such as Positano or Capri. I would highly recommend paying the extra for a seaview room as this hotel enjoys unobstructed views of the port and ocean – you can even see Naples and Ischia in the distance!  As the centre of Sorrento you really can’t miss the chance to wander through and people watch in Piazza Tasso. This square is crazy at the best of times – with locals, visitors and traffic fighting for the right of way in every direction you turn. There are a few restaurants and cafes in this area that provide a great pit stop to break up your day, sit back and people watch as the crowds pass you by.  Although Piazza Tasso is the centre of Sorrento, the Marina Grande might be considered just as central as this is where you will board and disembark ferries around the Amalfi Coast. Marina Grande connects you with Naples, Capri, Ischia, Positano and Amalfi. For a full timetable, see here.  Undeniably the most popular day trip to make from Sorrento is to catch the short, 20 minute ferry ride from Marina Grande to nearby Capri – Amalfi’s most renowned holiday destination. Prices on Capri are noticeable more expensive, both for accommodation and general expenses like a coffee, gelato, or sit down lunch. This is of course to be expected for an island location, however give you all the more reason to visit for a day from neighbouring Sorrento rather than needing to stay overnight here. A great way to get around the island is by hiring a scooter and hitting the open road, or you can also walk to Capri Town from the ferry terminal or if mobility is an issue there are taxis (with the top down no less!) always available.  The Italians are no stranger to eating on the go and to my delight, Sorrento was full of great street food to snack on all day whilst wandering the streets. My favourite finds were: My absolute favourite gelateria in town was Primavera – home to an endless supply of delicious flavours that made me feel as if I was in some sort of gelato heaven (really – it was that good!) Flavour highlights included Snickers, Kinder Bueno, Salted Butter Caramel and Mars. I know, I know… not very cultural but believe me when I say this street food stopover was entirely worth my while and will be worth yours, too. These were hands down the best frites I have tried in my lifetime. Cooked fresh and topped with ketchup + mayonnaise. All over town you will notice a stream of crêpe stands and if you’re a fan of the crunchy delights elsewhere in Europe, you’ll be delighted to learn they are just as delicious here! I wouldn’t say any particular store was a standout as they seem to be pretty standardised and (to my delight) were heavy on the fillings. Delicious!  My boyfriend summer it up when he turned to me in the street one day and said “Brooke, we’re in Italy, nothing is going to taste bad.” He was right. This particular region of Italy is bursting with delicious flavours, focusing heavily on rich tomato sauces, lemon flavoured desserts and an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables. My favourite dish from this region is aubergine casserole – baked aubergines in a rich, creamy, tomato and cheese sauce, served with freshly grated parmesan. If you’re looking for great recommendations from locals, try these: With a beautiful outdoor ambiance in the warmer months and fantastic, hearty, authentic cuisine, you really can’t go wrong by booking yourself a table at L’Antica Trattoria. This is one of the most popular restaurants in town so be sure to book a table in advance. If fancy plating and small portions are your thing, then head on over to Terrazza Marziale for a contemporary take on classic Italian dishes in a gorgeous, romantic setting. Bookings recommended.  "
211,"Visiting Chateau de Cormatin is as postcard-perfect as a film set. With its well-kept gardens and an imposing grand exterior that will captivate you at first sight, this is truly one of the most beautiful châteaus in Burgundy. I visited the 17th-century masterpiece on a recent visit to Burgundy to learn why this family-run restored mansion is a must-visit when travelling through the South of Burgundy.  The château is located a short drive between both Tournus and Cluny in the heart of South Burgundy. The 17th century masterpiece has been restored by a family who had ambitions to purchase, restore and open to the public a château and tell its’ story, whilst also living on the grounds for daily operations. The family did so well out of the newfound business that in fact, they have now purchased and redone a second château in France – talk about living the dream! Cormatin was originally built by Marquis d’Huxelles and while I won’t spoil the history lesson you will gain onsite, I will say that the stories are truly fascinating! The retelling is made much easier with thanks to the restoration efforts – recreations of bed chambers, dining areas (in the bedroom) and secret meeting points.  My fascination with French noble history comes from studies at university, while gaining my undergraduate degree in International Relations with a minor in French and Russian history (yup, I’m a bit of a nerd!) What I found to be interesting is how the current owners of Château de Cormatin have managed to re-create a linear narrative whilst paying tribute to the origins of the mansion, which was originally built as a summer home (a display of wealth as opposed to a place of true leisure). The gardens are as impressive as the moat-guarded property, complete with a maze and wide range of fauna that is popularly seen throughout Burgundy and countryside France. A total of 11 hectares have been maintained around the property and are regarded as some of the most beautiful in the region.  Location: Between Tournus and Cluny Opening Days: 7 days a week, April ~ November Opening Hours: 10am-6pm Price: 11€ Book your tickets here"
212,"I was in my early twenties when I first travelled to cities in Eastern Europe. Since then, the cities I visited have become some of my favourite destinations across the continent. There’s just something so magical about getting off the beaten path and going somewhere new. Travelling to cities that shock and excite you. And that is entirely why I’m here to share with you my favourite cities in Eastern Europe to help you book an adventure of your own! Stealing hearts now more than ever, Budapest has become one of the most popular cities in Eastern Europe and for good reason. Many moons ago (okay maybe only 7 years give or take), the city of Budapest was one of Europe’s best kept secrets and indeed one of its’ most underrated cities. Nowadays Budapest has become a must visit for travellers looking to venture East from Central European countries like Germany, Austria and Slovenia, especially so if you’re hoping for an escape from the €.

It is undeniably one of the most popular cities in Eastern Europe – but this hasn’t always been the case. This city on the coast of Croatia is a summer worth crossing an ocean for, so whatever direction you’re coming from – be sure to give yourself plenty of time to unwind! Read more: 10 Things you Must Do in Croatia Of all the cities I’ve explored in Europe, St Petersburg is the one I was most excited for and boy did it not disappoint. Having studied Russian history at university I was determined to see the legacy of Peter the Great – both in introducing Eastern Europe to Western culture and customs, as well as the architecture, art and of course a visit to the palatial summer residence to visit the royal gardens in all their playful glory.

This fairytale capital city has one of Europe’s most well-preserved Old Towns, with the likes of Unicorn juice still available for purchase at the local pharmacy. Sold! Read more: The Top 10 Things to do in Tallinn, Estonia Riga has become another “quick visit” city for travellers in the Baltics, thanks to its’ cheap airlines connecting many travel routes from East to West and vice versa. Riga is a city worthy of at least two full days to explore and has a lot of charm on offer, especially in the Spring/Summer time. My visits to Prague have been plentiful – thanks in part to a short stint living in Berlin, but mostly to an undying love affair with this fascinating city. Blending a range of architectures (mostly Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque), this city is a world in itself. Expect a handful of magical encounters and quirky boutiques selling figurines as mysterious as the encounters on the street. This is quite a fun city to explore! Read more: A Guide to Visiting Prague Krakow is a city many of us long to visit – not only for its charm and beauty, but also the dark past of nearby Auschwitz and Birkenau that allow visitors to pay respects, stop and learn the details of the Holocaust. The city itself is vibrant and buzzing with students, giving it a unique appeal for young travellers looking to mix in with locals and enjoy all the city has to offer.

The city itself deserves a day or two to explore, though you could very happily perch yourself on an Air BnB balcony for a handful of days to enjoy a slower pace as your dollar will inevitably stretch farther when converting to the Romanian leu. Read more: 8 Places you Must Visit in Romania The capital of Poland has a turbulent past, however an ongoing effort to preserve the city’s Old Town in all of its glory makes this one of Eastern Europe’s prettiest capitals – a title of which it so often does receive (but very much deserves!) Poland still remains on the zloty, making it one of the more affordable countries to visit in Europe, allowing you to spend a while longer and stretch your dollar further. Read more: A Quick Guide to Warsaw The capital of Serbia has a way of capturing hearts, especially in the warmer months when diners take their lunches and dinners al fresco, in balmy evenings that see much of the city’s inhabitants surface for an all round social affair. The city is also one of the most affordable cities to visit on the list and as such is a great spot to stop for a while and enjoy life like a local (Aussies: also note that Serbia is not included in your Schengen visa allowance of 90 days!) Venturing further East, Lviv is located a short journey onwards from the Polish border and is Ukraine’s seventh largest city, making it the perfect size to explore over a few days. The architecture is a marvel in itself, with influences from nearby Poland, Austro-Hungarian heritage and a unique mix between Eastern, Central and Western European styles. Romania is one of Europe’s most underrated countries to visit and home to some of the most epic landscapes you will see the world over. Mountains, valleys and impressive castles await, with Sibiu being one of the best cities to base yourself to explore the nearby region. Located in the region of Transylvania, Sibiu is one of the gateways to the castles in the nearby region. Be sure not to miss Bran Castle (also known as Dracula’s castle) and Peles Castle (the filming location for the recent film A Christmas Prince). The Russian capital is as fascinating in real life as you could imagine, even if you let your mind get creative. Visiting historic sites, churches and of course the Kremlin will require at least four days on the ground to experience it all. Even if you’re staying centrally, be sure to venture underground to Moscow’s metro stations as they are considered some of the most extravagant and opulent in the world.

Finally, the capital of Ukraine would still have to be one of our most favourite cities in Eastern Europe and still one of the most underrated (how we are still unsure!?) There is endless history to be discovered and an ever-changing future for the country with Kiev at the heart of it. Be sure to allow at least four days on the ground to explore the city of Kiev – the sheer geographic size of the city is astounding! Over to you! Where are your favourite cities in Eastern Europe?

213,"Packing for Paris can be overwhelming no matter how many times you visit, so we’ve compiled a list of everything you need to pack for Paris. Knowing what to wear in Paris comes easy for French girls, but for visitors the capital of chic can be a tough style to master. Here is our complete packing guide for Paris to help you plan your trip! If you are visiting Paris from June-August then you absolutely must pack light. Light dresses are an easy option as just one garment will give you a complete look (although style it with a hat or scarf for the ultimate Parisian look!) If you are visiting Paris in Spring (aka cherry blossom season) then you’ll need to pack more of a mix of items. April and May can be beautiful and warm but there are often cold days thrown in to the mix. Pack a few longer midi-length dresses to be on the safe side and cover your bases. Pair a midi-dress with an oversized blazer for a day to night look. If I’m visiting Paris outside of the summer season (June, July, August), I will always pack a few pairs of light linen pants and a variety of long and short sleeve shirts/blouses. The weather can change a few times a day in Paris so be sure to always take a light jacket to throw over your outfit. One thing is for certain in Parisian fashion: you should always pack a scarf. A scarf is a very French way to dress up an outfit, add dimension, or often as a practicality. Scarves are a great addition to cover your shoulders when the wind turns or you can pack it in your handbag for the day if you are planning to be on the move from day to night. Hats are another great way to tie in an outfit, especially in the warmer months where they come in handy to combat the sun. A classic straw hat is a safe bet. A final note on packing for Paris: you are sure to notice the radiance of Parisian’s skin that appears effortlessly sunkissed and lightly freckled. French women take a lot of pride and care in their skin and no matter how many times I visit, it always prompts me to take better care of my own! Above are some of the tried and tested products I swear by and never travel without. The Eve Lom cleanser is great when travelling and I’d highly recommend packing your own muslin cloths when you travel. A face oil is a necessity to rehydrate when travelling and a good eye cream will go a long way to combatting tired, jet lagged eyes.

214,"I never thought I would fall so in love with Scandinavia, especially in the form of a capital city. But Stockholm just has a way of capturing your heart. With old-world charm and pastel buildings, there is a unique mix of old meets new. So if you’re visiting Stockholm for the first time, here’s everything you absolutely must see and do! Let’s dive in to the complete Stockholm bucket list.  Although locals regard it as “touristy”, there’s no denying this is the most picturesque part of town. Gamla Stan is like stepping into a children’s fairytale book, complete with pastel coloured shop fronts and charming little doorsteps. There are also some beautiful little cafes here to pass the hours by, especially considering the Swedish excel in their cake + pastry offerings! If you should make just one indoors visit during your time in Stockholm, you should make it the Vasa Museum. This maritime museum is home to an impressive collection and even houses an entire 17th century ship that has been salvaged and restored. Another museum worth your while couldn’t be any more different if it tried – the Skansen open-air museum is more of a zoo and home to a range of animals (great choice for the kids!) Catch the ferry to the island for the full experience and be sure to enjoy the views as you make your way by water.  As the island where Skansen Open Air Museum is located, often visitors to Stockholm are on a tight schedule and don’t take the time to enjoy their surrounds (remember its the journey – not the destination!) However if you do find yourself with a little time up your sleeve, be sure to stick around as this island is thoroughly enjoyable in the warmer months and offers a great opportunity for a picnic in the summer sunshine. One thing I really love about Stockholm and I’m sure you will too, is that it is a city completely surrounded by water. Whether you’re walking from point to point or just walking for the sake of walking, be sure to pass by the water’s edge wherever possible, as this is where you can enjoy arguably the best view of the city – for free! A great walking route I found in the city was from my hotel, through Gamla Stan, and onwards to Fotografskia Museum. This is (as the name suggest) a photographic museum and has as fantastic gift shop at the end for photo lovers and enthusiasts.  It’s no secret that Stockholm is FULL of great restaurants, though most of those will cost a day or sometimes a week’s paycheck to dine at! Instead, head straight for the first bakery you see and indulge in a cinnamon roll – BOY do they know how to make those things in Stockholm! Yes, I’m 100% serious. I visited Stockholm with my doting mother, who proclaimed prior to our trip that the only thing she wanted to do in Stockholm was to visit the ABBA Museum – and so we did. To my surprise I also (really) enjoyed the museum and would totally recommend it to anyone who has at least heard a couple of their hit tracks. If one thing is for certain in Stockholm it is that no matter what route you take walking around the city, the gigantic Drottingham Palace is difficult to ignore. While the guards outside are worthy of a visit alone (who could pass up the chance to see a man in uniform!?), the inside of the Palace is just as exciting if you’re interested in the history of the royals.  As previously mentioned, Stockholm is home to some fabulous restaurants and if you can cringe your way past the price list, you can enjoy one of the best meals of your life! The culinary scene in Stockholm is one of the best in the world and I can personally (highly – super, super highly) recommend Gastrologik. The City Hall might not seem like an exciting place from the exterior, but inside lies this hidden beauty – a room made of gold – with over 18 million tiles to be exact! Another great indoors activity in Stockholm is to visit the Nobel Museum, home to stacks of information and inspiration surrounding the Nobel Prize and its’ winners.  As far as subways go, Stockholm has some pretty intriguing subway stations in the centre of the city to discover as works of art in their own right. Its not often that you can say you’ve had a coffee at the world’s THIRD BEST coffee shop! Take up the opportunity at Drop Coffee and see what all the fuss is about. As far as street food goes, Stockholmers have surprisingly good offerings, in the form of hotdogs. If you’re a sucker for the old and faithful, this is a great cheap eats alternative in a city that will quickly drain your pocket!  As Stockholm is a city surrounded by water, it should come at no surprise that there are many bridges connecting the city together! Be sure to walk over to Sodermalm and if you can, catch a sunset here at one of the many viewpoints – they’re to die for! One thing you absolutely cannot miss before leaving the city is a boat ride around the city and its’ many pockets, particularly at sunset!   "
215,"It often feels like Slovenia has more castles than it does hotels. Every new city or town you arrive in, you’re almost certain to find an imposing castle. Often, they’re located high above the city looking down on the town folk. After travelling extensively throughout Slovenia this summer, I’ve compiled a list of the best castles to visit in Slovenia. These are the most impressive castles that are open to the public and one you can even stay in! Chances are that if you’re travelling to Slovenia, you’re going to visit Bled. Lake Bled is one of the most iconic and idyllic locations in the entire country. Sitting pretty above the lake is the impressive medieval Bled Castle, the first castle in Bled. Nowadays it is open to the public as a living museum. To make the most of your visit, be sure to drop by the restaurant for lunch. It is here where you will find one of the best views over Lake Bled. Slovenia’s capital city is home to one of the most visited castles in the country. Ljubljana Castle offers a brilliant view of the city below. If you can time your visit with sunrise or sunset, it is one of the best views in the city. Plan your visit: A Guide to Ljubljana The impressive Predjama castle is built into a cave mouth, making this one of the most spectacular castles in Slovenia. Just a short drive from Postojna caves, this castle is one of the more remote castles to visit. Despite its remote location, this castle attracts many visitors locally and from neighbouring countries. Combine your visit with a stop at the predjama caves for the ultimate experience in the southeast of Slovenia. What makes Otočec Castle so special is that you can stay here. This beautifully refurbished castle is one of Slovenia’s most celebrated hotels. For the past decade has been welcoming travellers as royal guests. The castle is located in the southeast of the country which is much less visited by international tourists. Even in the summer months the castle is quiet on weekdays, making it a great escape. Celje is one of Slovenia’s major cities and the main attraction for travellers is Celje Castle. The castle ruins are open to visitors seven days. However, the castle itself is currently in the process of being restored. Celje itself can be considered a gate to visiting more of the south and southeast of the country. If you’re looking for more to see in this area, consider nearby Otočec Castle and Žužemberk Castle. Žužemberk Castle is my final suggestion to complete your castles of Slovenia tour. The castle is located in the southeast of Slovenia and originated in the 13th century. The present shape of the castle changed to protect against enemies in the 16th century."
216,"Filled with medieval towns and Renaissance architecture, Belgium remains one of the most overlooked destinations in Western Europe. The country is a mecca for quaint and charming towns, hearty food, a strong dining culture and a beautiful countryside to explore. These are the 10 best places to visit in Belgium and you’ll need at least a week to see them all. Situated in the Walloon region, Dinant is idyllically located on the edge of the Meuse River and backed by scenic steep cliffs. With iconic Belgian houses, a centuries old Citadel and a gothic church, this city is one of the most photogenic locations in the country but one of the least visited. One of the most photographed locations in Belgium and indeed one of the prettiest small towns in all of Europe, Bruges is as pretty as a postcard and packed with some great restaurants, bars, cafes and small art galleries. Just a short train ride from Bruges and you will arrive at Ghent, a heavily populated student town with incredible architecture and a vibrant bar scene with thanks to its youthful population. A port city on the river Scheldt, Antwerp has a history that dates to the Middle Ages. In the centre of town you will find the centuries-old Diamond District houses which house diamond traders, cutters and polishers. As Belgium’s second-biggest city there is a lot to experience and explore in Antwerp. All you need to do is walk through the Old Town Centre and veer off from there. This city is best explored on foot without a plan!  Located in the city of Ghent, Gravensteen is a medieval castle that should not be missed. The castle dates back to 1180 and has been repurposed over the years, even once as a cotton factory. Nowadays it is a museum and tourist site with a great view over the city. The capital of Belgium and the centre of the European Union, Brussels is a melting pot of cultures. This makes Brussels such a joy to explore. For those interested more in history than the present day, check out The Grand Place. This is one of the most photogenic old squares with historic buildings that date back to the 14th century. In the French-speaking region of Wallonia, Liège is a commercial and cultural hub with a population of around 200,000. Situated in Lennik, Gaasbeek Castle is one of Belgium’s prettiest castles, dreamily located in the countryside province of Flemish Brabant. Follow us on Instagram for more daily travel inspiration!"
217,"The first time my feet hit the ground in Paris I knew it was a homecoming of sorts. Having long been obsessed with France and French culture, visiting the capital had been a dream I held true for many years before arriving and I’ve since learned it is a dream I will never let go of. And if you’re thinking of traveling solo in Paris, I’ve got all the inside tips for you! When I first visited Paris on my own, I booked a cheap studio apartment in on Rue Etienne Marcel and would set off each day to explore the city on foot. Now (many years later) I have learned there are better neighbourhoods to explore Paris solo, better practices for doing so beyond relying on converse sneakers and plenty of great things to do in this city solo. The WOW Guide to Paris  Over to you! What are some of your favourite memories from travelling solo in Paris?"
218,"Food has got to be one of my all-time favourite topics to cover on World of Wanderlust because, well, I really like food. If you’ve been following my travels for a while now you will be no stranger to the fact that I love sweet treats. So when I started to write a journal about what I ate in Paris, I realised this might make a great blog post. Food is, after all, a big part of travel! When in Paris on this trip I was on a mission of sorts, to sample as many sweets as possible and balance it out with a few savoury dishes for good measure. I’ve been working on a new project of late which allows me to regard sweets-testing as “research marketing”, so I’m gonna claim that as my reason for all of the over-indulgence… not that you ever need a reason!  You can’t really come to Paris and not visit the Angelina tea house at least once. Yes, it is expensive. Yes, it is a cliché and no, I do not think any of this matters. I brought my boyfriend here for his first time (my umpteenth) and he was amazed at the full flavour of the hot chocolate, which is, in my opinion, the best in Paris. We also tried the Mont Blanc (I had previously avoided the pastries in an effort to fit in more hot chocolates) which was far too rich for my liking and with a difficult to swallow consistency. Angelina is however renowned for their Mont Blanc so perhaps just my personal preference is something a little lighter! Address: 226 Rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris (and many more locations in Paris)
Nearest transport: Tuileries (1)
Hours: Open every day, 7:30 a.m.-7:00 p.m // 8:30 a.m.-7:30p.m. Sat/Sun  The best macarons I ate on this trip were not at Laduree or even Pierre Herme. They were a complete fluke as the cafe located next door to our hotel so happened to sell macarons and they so happened to be the most delicious macarons I have tasted (in my life. Ever.) Turns out Carette is kind of famous for their macarons so I do suggest you stop by! The salted butter caramel was a true standout (yes, that is a large size you see pictured!) Address: 25 place des Vosges, 75004 (also 4 place du Trocadero)
Nearest transport: Chemin Vert (8) or Saint-Paul (1)
Hours: Open every day, 7 a.m.-11:30 p.m  Whenever I’m in Paris I know one thing for sure: the best cheap eats in the city are located in the Latin Quarter and they never disappoint. Paris is an inherently expensive city to visit, but there are so many great cheap eats to be found in the Latin Quarter with dishes from all over the world, but mostly Northern Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Being a vegetarian I can’t go past a good falafel (Maoz is a safe bet for consistency) and my boyfriend tried a regular ol’ street kebab.  I can’t even begin to tell you how many pastries we ate in Paris. Turns out the best pastry we ate was actually two hours outside of Paris in the Loire Valley, but the ones we ate in the French capital were still pretty darn good. For the best croissant in Paris, head to Sébastien Gaudard – Pâtisserie des Martyrs (22 rue des Martyrs). You’ll find the best pan au chocolat at Gérard Mulot (6, rue du Pas de la Mule). And for something a little heavier, La Parisienne is said to have the best baguette in town (48 rue Madame, 75006).  If you’ve been reading my blog for a while now you will know I take my ice cream testing and tasting pretty seriously. Googling where to find the best ice cream in town when I visit a new city is a common occurrence and if you ask me where my favourite ice cream is in the world, you will get a response of at least 20 establishments across all continents. For Paris, you can’t go past Berthillon. On this trip I stuck with my old classic faves: salted butter caramel, dark chocolate, and pistachio. Address: 29-31 Rue Saint-Louis en l’Île, 75004 Paris
Nearest transport: Pont Marie (7)
Hours: Open Weds-Sun, 10 a.m.-8 p.m  I know, I know… by now you’re starting to wonder if I ever eat savoury food. The truth is that I don’t eat a whole lot of savoury food that excites me, as being a vegetarian with a handful of intolerances I find it difficult to find great dishes I can eat. So next we dropped into the Hôtel Plaza Athénée on Avenue Montaigne to try their afternoon tea, as they are renowned for offering a sweets only selection of pastries (no scones, no tiny sandwiches… just straight to the good stuff!) I’d love to give a detailed description of everything we ate but there were just so many pastries and so little time! We mistakenly ordered x1 setting per person, later realising x1 serving is enough to share between two. Address: 25 Avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris
Nearest transport: Franklin D. Roosevelt (1, 9)
Hours: Open Weds-Sun, 10 a.m.-8 p.m  Because I have a total of zero self control and because there are now so many Angelina locations throughout Paris, I couldn’t help but to stop in once more to grab a couple pastries to go. I didn’t love the macaron selection nearly as much as Carette, but I did enjoy the delicious and overly indulgent Joconde – a combination of macaron, lightly whipped cream and fresh raspberries. Drool!  On our last evening in Paris after eating ourselves into what can only be described as a sugar-induced coma, I treated my boyfriend to his first Michelin star restaurant experience at Il Carpaccio, an Italian one Michelin starred restaurant located inside Raffles Hotel. We ordered three courses: The meal began with an artichoke starter, not a typical choice for either of us but unquestionably delicious with a variety of textures to open our minds to the experience ahead. Sadly my main dish (asparagus risotto) was nothing to write home about and lacked any flavour whatsoever, but my boyfriend’s face lit up as he worked his way through his main meal. But the true highlight (hardly a surprise) was the Pierre Herme dessert. This would have had to been one of the best desserts of my life to date: a pictachio mousse enrusted in a crunchy case, topped with whipped cream, whole pistachios, strawberries and raspberry sorbet + coulis. To die for! Address: 37 Avenue Hoche, 75008 Paris
Nearest transport: Charles de Gaulle Étoile (1, 2, 6) or Ternes (2)

219,"Ever wanted to arrive in a city and rely on nothing more than your own two feet to get around from A to B? This is indeed my absolute favourite way to get around cities, especially in Europe as there is just so much to discover above ground. Sure, you should make the effort in Russia’s capital and former capital Moscow & St Petersburg respectively, as these cities’ subway stations are a work of art in themselves… but these cities are best explored above ground, walking between attractions, coffee shops and boutiques.  I’ve made it no secret over the years that Salzburg is one of my favourite European cities, but what’s more is that it is a fantastic city to walk around, even in a thick blanket of snow! I first visited Salzburg in the shock European Cold Wave of 2012, but even then the city was glorious to walk around – albeit well below freezing, of course! In summer the city really comes to life, though this is also when the crowds begin pouring in, especially on day trips from Vienna. Thus the best option is to stay a few nights in Salzburg and explore in the early mornings and just before dusk, when you will find you often have some parts of the city to yourself. Be sure to visit the Mirabell Gardens on foot, as well as meandering through the endless alleyways of the Old Town. Should you wish to explore beyond the city, a Sound of Music Tour is a must for fans of the film.  Amsterdam is a favourite of many travellers and I myself am no exception! Whilst this city is not best seen by walking (that falls second to the seeing the city by the canals), the city is incredibly well suited to walkers and even cyclers should you dare rent a bike and do as the locals do! If walking is more your style, this city is quite expansive but can easily be covered in a few days, especially as it is relatively flat. Be sure to take a map as before you know it you’ll wind up in a completely different area to that anticipated, but also don’t be afraid to get lost at times, especially in idyllic neighbourhoods such as Jordaan.  Located just a short drive, bus ride or train ride from London, Oxford is entirely possible to visit in a day, especially if you like walking discoveries. This city has so much to offer in terms of history, architecture, and many great academics have once called Oxford home so it is bursting with intrigue. Harry Potter fans should head straight for Christ College, whilst Lewis Carroll fans will have plenty of points of interest throughout the city to enjoy. All in all this is a great city to discover on foot as there is so much to see at every turn, and geographically speaking the inner city itself is quite small. Should you be interested in travelling further abroad in the area, here are the best things to do in Oxfordshire.  Venice is a city that is best explored on foot – hands down, no questions asked. Whilst a gondola ride is a right of passage for visitors, the best way to actually see and experience Venice is by exploring the narrow alleys and seeing where you wind up. Never mind getting lost, you will always find your way back one way or another! Just be sure to be open to the idea of getting lost as the best of Venice is beyond the tourist attractions and in the heart of the neighbourhoods themselves.  One of my all time favourite cities in the world is the glorious, extremely picturesque, more-a-town-than-a-city, Brugge in Belgium. This is a small city that is very flat and thus easy to get around on foot, though beware of those harsh winters! Up in Northern Belgium the weather can get quite bitter quite quickly, so be sure to wear plenty of layers if visiting outside of the warmer months. The entire Historic Centre of Brugge is UNESCO listed, so you’ll find adoration at every turn.  Although a huge city to navigate your way around with plenty of little pockets that should be granted an entire day of exploring each, Paris is a city that is still best seen on foot – with the added aid of a metro stop or two of course! Paris is incredibly large so I wouldn’t recommend trying to visit the entire city on foot (unless you have a few weeks to explore), however there are a few neighbourhoods that deserve exploring for at least a half day each. St Germain des pres, Montmartre and the Latin Quarter are all worth exploring, though in all fairness this list could go on forever!  I’ve never met a person who has travelled to Prague and not fallen in love with this city. Prague is another great European city to explore on foot, despite a noticeable climb to the top of Prague Castle (albeit a worthwhile climb for those city views!) Be sure to explore both lesser town and the old town centre, as there is much to see beyond Prague’s main attractions, discoverable almost immediately as you leave the main streets.  Florence steals the heart of all who enter. As arguably the most photogenic Italian city, Florence is bursting with life and colour at every turn. It is entirely possible to walk around all of the attractions in Florence in a few days, however be sure to allow time for many gelato stops to refuel along the way!  Cinque Terre has quickly become an Italian staple for visitors touring the country. The area is a collection of small towns that can quite comfortably be reached on foot, though do expect some steep inclines as you will be traversing the Italian coastline. Also note that walking is required here, as roads have little access in the towns themselves.  As one of my personal favourite cities in the United Kingdom, I can’t possibly begin to tell you how much I adore Edinburgh! If you can withstand the occasional down pour, Edinburgh is a great city to explore year-round the the winters are dark with a mysterious sense of beauty. There will be some inclines to get the best views over the city, but all in all walking is the best way to explore Edinburgh.  From the colourful seaside area of Nyhaven through to royal castles with impeccably dressed guards, there is so much to explore in Copenhagen on foot. This city gets extremely cold during winter due to its’ northerly location, however if you can brave the cold (and make many hot drink stops along the way), you can certainly explore Copenhagen year-round.  As one of my favourite German cities and not just because of Oktoberfest (!!!), Munich is the perfect gateway to exploring more of Bavaria. The city itself is gorgeous to walk around and the attractions are minimal, so you can just wander at leisure.  Lisbon has really picked up in tourism over the past few years and as a huge fan of the city myself, I find it pretty easy to see why! This is a city filled with colour and the friendly locals make this even more enjoyable than you’d ever imagine. Alfama is a great neighbourhood to explore on foot for half a day, combined with some time in the city centre and heading up the coastline to magical Sintra & Cascais.  Ljubljana is what I would consider to be Europe’s most underrated capital city. Whilst small in size, this city certainly packs a lot of charm into a small area, making it one of the most walkable cities in Europe and without a doubt one of the most charming.  Finally Stockholm, an old favourite that I fell head over heels with upon first visit and would jump at the opportunity to return! The Swedish capital has a lot to offer visitors, though as it is surrounded by water you will need to add a few ferry rides in their in order to see it all! The Old Town, Gamla Stan, is the perfect place to spend hours wandering and people watching at one of the charming cafes."
220,"As the fourth largest city in Norway, Stavanger strikes a unique balance between old-world charm and city vibrance. With just one day in Stavanger, I set out to see why this is one of Norway’s most charming cities and what one should do whilst visiting the city and the region.  As we were cruising our way through the coastal cities and towns of Norway, we unsurprisingly started our day in Stavanger at the harbour, which also acts as a central point of reference when visiting the city. The harbour itself was a beautiful area to stroll around in the morning and from here you could take one of two routes: one through the old town and one to the modern city where you would wind your way through endless shops along cute narrow streets.  As this was said to be the most photographic part of town, I naturally chose to begin my day exploring Stavanger here, in the heart of the Old Town. This area is incredibly well preserved and offers visitors an insight into Norwegian life and history. Whilst the houses were once used as accommodation when Stavanger was the capital of Norway, they are now privately owned and kept in a timeless sense that allows you to step back in time.  Another beautiful part of town that is less talked about is located just off the main shopping area on a street named Ovre Holmegate. Here you can wander the bright, colourful streets that show a quirkier side to the city of Stavanger, stopping in at one of the many vintage clothing stores, record stores, or small cafes. Although small, this part of town has a much more relaxed, care-free vibe and is a great place for people watching!  Even though Stavanger is the third largest city in Norway, you will easily cover the city in half a day and thus might be looking to venture beyond the city for what Norway is really known for: hikes and nature! The most popular day trip nearby is Preikestolen, accessible by ferry and a 3.8 kilometre hike. If you’re up for an adventure the views overlooking Lysefjorden are said to be incredible (sadly we didn’t have time!) I visited Stavanger on an 8 night cruise of the Norwegian Fjords with Celebrity Cruises. I would highly recommend both the cruise and the late summer sailing (end of August) if you’re looking for a slice of sunshine with a chance of rain!"
221,"You couldn’t possibly go wrong with a honeymoon in Italy – the home of romance and La Dolce Vita! Italians have been serving up romance on a plate since time began, with an impressive landscape that features the likes of the rolling hills of Tuscany, the jaw-dropping coastline of the Amalfi Coast and the effortlessly impressive city on water; Venice. Choosing a destination or handful of destinations to honeymoon in Italy is the hardest choice of all – the rest, you will be delighted to learn, comes easily. Italy is hard not to enjoy, oozing with charm and always featuring mouth-watering cuisine… there really isn’t much not to love. So, wondering where to honeymoon in Italy? We’ve got you covered!  Lets begin up North in the Italian Lakes District with Lago di Como (Lake Como), an unquestionably romantic lake with plenty of towns, villages, villas and castles to explore to keep you busy for at least a few days. You can choose to take it slow and spend the majority of your time checked in to your lakeside villa or make your way out onto the lake to explore the history and culture of the area by visiting one of the public villas such as Villa Carlotta, or making your way by ferry to the most charming lakeside town of all: Bellagio.  Rolling hills, vineyards, endless streams of colour… you really can’t go wrong by taking your Italian honeymoon through Tuscany, especially if travelling by car. This region is best explored at your own pace, taking the time to take it all in, sample the local wines, food, and even learn a new hobby such as painting or ceramics, which are both popular in this area. Florence is at the centre of Tuscany and provides a great destination to base yourself for days trips, but ensure you allow yourself at least a few days to explore the city itself as it is without doubt the prettiest large city in all of Italy.  Cinque Terre has quickly become a cultural phenomenon of sorts with many travellers flocking to the colourful cliffside to see what all the fuss is about. Due to its increasing popularity over the past few years it would be best to visit out of the high season (June, July, August) if possible or you should consider a day trip visit throughout your travels to avoid the chaos of it all. Sure, it is still as gorgeous as the pictures suggest, but to relax and unwind on your holiday you might prefer to base yourself in a more quiet location a little off the beaten path.  The Amalfi Coast would have to be my top pick for a romantic getaway in Italy, though is best combined with other destinations such as a city escape in Rome, a few nights meandering the streets of Venice, and five to seven days to unwind on the Amalfi coast. Upon arrival be sure to stop in at Naples for the best pizza of your life (Naples is indeed the birthplace of the breaded snack), stay a few nights in Sorrento or Capri, and journey onwards to the true and unquestionable gem of the coast: Positano.  As the largest of the Italian islands it is little wonder Sicily has a lot to offer visitors, especially honeymooners who are looking to escape the tourist crowds and opt for a more local experience. You can still expect crowds and plenty of them in the summer time, however will be rubbing shoulders with more Italians than foreigners as this is a holiday hot spot locals. Although surrounded by three seas you can expect much more than just a beach vacay in Siciliy, as you will also find mountains & hills to add to the magic of the crystal blue waters in Italy’s deep South.  (image)  An obvious choice, this list would not be complete without mention of Venice, the city built on water that continues to entice honeymooners year after year. Sure, Venice is busy and sure, this takes away from the magic of it all… but this is all part of what modern day Venice is: a living museum for travellers to come and experience in a time warp of sorts. Looking at booking a glorious five star hotel to lap it up? Save your money and splurge elsewhere as 3 and 4 star hotels in Venice offer just as much charm and character, especially if you can find one that has stayed in the family for generations.  A city that is said to have inspired Shakespeare, Verona is impossible romantic, full of charm, and a great onwards destination from Venice (though don’t expect to escape the crowds as Verona is still very popular in the summer months). While still a city vacation, Verona is much smaller whilst still packing in a lot of charm, especially in the evenings when the city comes to life in a craze of al fresco dining.  To escape the crowds and enjoy a more local experience, make your way down South to Italy’s boot and explore the Puglia region. With dramatic scenery and fantastic local cuisine, you can’t have anything but a fabulous experience in Italy’s deep South and if you’re looking to get off the beaten path, this is where to do so. Expect a plethora of olive groves, minimal street signs and a relentless summer sun that will leave you feeling oh so Italiano in no time at all!  (image)"
222,"I didn’t know how to pronounce Jezersko when I arrived in Slovenia. Granted, I didn’t know how to pronounce the capital city in which I landed (Ljubljana), either. Over the course of a few days chatting with locals in cafes and ice cream stores (this is summer in Slovenia after all), I began to brush up on my language skills and before I knew it, I was pronouncing my J’s as Y’s like a local. Slovenia is the dream destination you didn’t know you had. Before boarding my flight from London Heathrow bound for Ljubljana, I got chatting with a British guy about my next destination. He had never heard of Slovenia before. A small country in central Europe, Slovenia was the first to separate from the former Yugoslavia. Partly because of this early independence, they have enjoyed huge economic success and are one of Europe’s success stories. It is a safe country to travel solo and still somehow located off the beaten path, despite being wedged between popular tourist destinations like Austria, Italy and Croatia. I went further off the beaten path to the mountains of Jezersko for a little R&R in the North of the country, close to the Austrian border. I visited Jezersko with one destination in mind: Vila Planinka. This resort only opened this year but has already become one of the most sought after stays in Slovenia. The concept of Vila Planinka is to unplug and recharge with nature. Guests are encouraged to switch off their phones during their visit and take the time to enjoy time offline. If this scares you, fear not. There is wi-fi connection in the main living area. The villa dubs itself as nature’s secret spot and it isn’t hard to see why. There are many popular destinations in Slovenia that have a name with international visitors but for the most part, Jezersko does not. It is still a secret. Located just a fifteen minute drive from the southern border with Austria, the location is enviable to say the least. During summer there are some great short day hikes to enjoy and through winter ski season brings a new appeal. Another highlight of my stay was the focus on local produce and showcasing typical food for the region. The chef was always around to chat about the food – its origin and why it was important to this part of Slovenia. Try the štruklji dumplings – you won’t regret it! I soon discovered there was much more to Jezersko than just Vila Planinka (although this is reason enough to put Jezersko on your Slovenian travel plans). Mountaineering, day hikes and summer lake culture are just the start of your adventure. The highlight itself is to simply be here in the mountains, but here are a few highlights to look out for regardless: Grintovec – With an elevation of 2,558 metres, Grintovec is a popular choice for hiking in the summer and skiing in the winter months. Storžic – The second highest peak, Storžic has a great panoramic view of the region. Kokra River – On your way to Jezersko from elsewhere in Slovenia you will pass the Kokra River more times than you can count. The drive is incredibly scenic with plenty of hairpin bends so keep your wits about you! Jezersko can be reached in just under one hour from Ljubljana, Slovenia’s capital. It is a beautiful drive through the countryside so be sure to allow 2-3 hours additional time if you wish to stop. I can highly recommend stopping at Kranj and Škofja Loka on the way (especially the latter, this town is something out of a movie!) Vila Planinka room rates start at €225 per room, per night. This includes breakfast."
223,"The Balkans is probably my favourite region in Europe. There, I said it. Although I love almost everywhere I’ve been in Europe, it is the Balkans where I feel most welcomed and somehow most at home. The hospitality and all-round welcoming nature of locals I have met in Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, and most recently Montenegro is such a genuine warmth that I struggle to board the plane every time I leave. If you’re new to exploring the Balkans or looking for more destinations to discover, these are the hidden gems I have found throughout my travels here. Many are small towns still undiscovered by masses of tourism, so be sure to make your way there before the rest of the world finds out! When I arrived in Perast I was reminded of my time in Venice as this small fishing village has a luxurious feel to it that many other small towns in Boka Bay do not. Perast has become the cooler cousin of nearby Kotor (which thanks mostly to cruise ships have become the most visited town in the entire country). As far as the best of the Balkans go, Montenegro is the most underrated. Another small town less famous than its neighbouring Mostar is Blagaj, a very tiny town down the road just fifteen minutes by car. Blagaj is most renowned for the Blagaj Tekija, a Sufi monastery built in to the cliff. But it is also a great little town to base yourself at a family homestay and explore Bosnia from, cross over the border in to Dubrovnik and explore the Balkan coast. If you haven’t heard of Dubrovnik (aka Kings Landing in the popular series you may or may not have heard of – Game of Thrones), then you must have been either living under a rock the past ten years or still watching DVDs. Dubrovnik is as picturesque as it looks – complete with terracotta rooftops, dramatic cliff edges and a coastal way of life inherit to the coastal Balkan countries. See this post for more of the best things to see and do in Croatia. A small town in the South of Montenegro, Kotor has become one of Europe’s fastest growing destinations with thanks to a huge influx of cruise ships making their way to Boka Bay. Despite the huge numbers of tourists visiting the small town, Kotor has managed to maintain its authenticity and with strict regulations on new buildings given its’ UNESCO World Heritage status, we can only hope it will stay that way. The road to Lovćen is narrow and winding, with a seemingly endless series of switchback hairpin turns that are enough to leave you (literally) on the edge of your seat, curled over your steering wheel trying to see the oncoming traffic ahead. However the hair-rising drive is worth the effort when you arrive, 90 minutes later to Lovćen and see epic panoramic views. Mostar is quickly becoming one of the most sought after destinations in Europe and indeed, one of the best of the Balkans! See this post for more of Bosnia’s must-visit travel destinations. The capital of Slovenia is perhaps the single most underrated city in all of Europe. Small in size, Ljubljana packs a punch for visitors as it is so incredibly picturesque that you would be forgiven for thinking you have stepped inside a postcard. The city can be discovered in one day if you are short on time but if you’re planning in advance be sure to give yourself two days to get gloriously lost in the streets, visit the public parks, and slow down while you discover Slovenian culture and hospitality. Another hidden gem I discovered when travelling throughout Bosnia was Počitelj. This hillside village overlooks the emerald green River Neretva and is just 30 kilometres south of Mostar, making it the perfect day trip. The village dates back to 1383 and between the 16th to 18th centuries was under Ottoman rule, in which time it developed to look as it does today. The first time I saw photos of Slovenia’s Lake Bled I squealed with excitement and then proceeded to book a trip to Slovenia, disregarding how far it was out of my travel plans. Lake Bled is hands down one of Europe’s most romantic destinations and if you ask me, the most beautiful lake in Europe. A small city in the southwest of the country, Ohrid is most renowned for the Church of St John at Kaneo. The church sits on a cliff edge overlooking Lake Ohrid. Known as the city of a thousand windows, Berat is commonly considered the most beautiful city in all of Albania. Here you can discover Byzantine churches, the Red Mosque and wander within the city walls to marvel at the Ottoman houses. Of all the things you must do in Croatia, Plitvice Lakes National Park should be at the top of your list, somewhere next to Dubrovnik and Istria. Thanks to Instagram this destination has become incredibly popular in the summer months, so be sure to arrive early at opening if you wish to enjoy the park all to yourself. Another great destination not to be missed in Croatia is Hvar. The island is characterised by its 13th century walls and terracotta roofs which welcome tourists from across the globe in the summer months. I’ve made it no secret that Peleș Castle is my favourite castle in all of Europe. Located in the Carpathian Mountains, you can easily visit this dreamy fairytale castle as a day trip from Brasov and combine your day trip with Bran Castle in Transylvania. If you’re looking for a less crowded alternative to Lake Bled or just spending more time exploring the gems of Slovenia, then be sure to add Lake Bohinj to your travel plans. Just a short water taxi ride from Perast and you will arrive at the Church of Our Lady Rocks in Montenegro’s Boka Bay. This location is a man made island and the church still operates today hosting many events and services. Located close to the island of Crete is this glorious pink sand beach with crystal clear turquoise waters. In good weather conditions you can walk from Crete to the island through shallow water. Skopelos might not be your first choice when travelling to Greece but that is probably because you haven’t heard of it. The more popular destinations like Santorini and Mykonos are indeed as beautiful as the photos suggest, but if you’re looking for something more beyond your next Instagram upload, you might consider a lesser known island like the quaint and charming Skopelos. Skopelos experienced an influx in tourism when it was revealed that a handful of scenes from the Mama Mia! film were filmed here, though in recent years has reverted more toward the sleepy seaside town it was once known as. This rock formation in central Greece has been picking up in popularity with thanks to its incredible mix of nature and man-made structures in to stone. The structures are in fact monasteries with six in total built in to the boulders. Now for one of the most popular destinations in Greece. Zakynthos became popular after it went viral on Instagram some years ago showing the dramatic cliffs and the shipwreck on the beach down below. While it is certainly one of the most famous holiday spots in Greece now, we would also recommend it as one of the best of the Balkans. "
224,"The capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana is building a name for itself as Europe’s most underrated city. This means two things: Ljubljana will surprise you and you should go sooner rather than later. If you’re planning a trip, this complete guide to Ljubljana will ensure you have a great time. The city of Ljubljana (pronounced: Leh -yoob – el – yah – nah) is renowned for its green spaces, university population and terracotta rooftops. Start your explorations in Ljubljana at the most strategic view point in the city: Ljubljana Castle. This was originally a medieval fortress dating back to the 11th century and was reconstructed in the 12th century. Today it is a living museum and offers the best view over the city below. The perfect place to continue your discovery of Ljubljana is at Tivoli Gardens, an oversized park in the city centre that is effortlessly green year-round. In spring and summer the flower baskets come in to bloom, so this is a must visit for nature lovers and garden enthusiasts (myself included!) The park is free to visit and can be reached in just 10-15 minutes walk from the city centre. Triple Bridge or Tromostovje as it is called in Slovene is a series of three bridges in the heart of Ljubljana. This is hands down one of the most photogenic spots in the city and is impossible to miss as it is in the centre of everything. The bridges connect the old town to the new town and a great way to see the city in this light is from the water on board one of the short river cruises. It is no secret that Ljubljana is a small capital city. This means that while there are a few key attractions you absolutely should visit, the beauty of the city is mostly in wandering the streets and soaking up the atmosphere. For that reason I would recommend staying a night or two in the city to really get a feel for it, though if you are on a tight schedule you can certainly see the city highlights in one day. Dragon Bridge is one of the most recognisable points in the city and another great photo opportunity. After you’ve got your photo memories under your belt, be sure to pull up a chair at one of the riverside restaurants or al fresco cafes. If you’re looking for that iconic shot of the city including the castle then look no further than the Ljubljana skyscraper. Nebotičnik Cafe is located on top of the skyscraper and serve a wide drinks menu, providing the perfect excuse to stop and take it all in. If you are spending more than one day in Ljubljana then be sure to discover the cities’ many coffee shops. If I’m honest, I wasn’t expecting to find extraordinary coffee here in Ljubljana. But a recent surge of young entrepreneurs has resulted in some great small businesses. Moderna Cafe was my favourite find for extremely good coffee and an artsy backdrop inside the Museum of Modern Art. Kavarna Stow is another great choice for coffee connoisseurs. Gastronomic Dinner – Landerik has one of the best reputations in town. Believe me when I say it is well deserved! Ice cream – look no further than Vigo. Super creamy ice creams and refreshing sorbets. I can highly recommend the mango sorbet. Bar for cocktails – Tozd is hands down your best choice. The ambiance is also really quaint and quirky. Vegan and Vegetarian – Surprisingly there are a lot of great options but TINK was my favourite. It features a heavy focus on superfoods but tastefully so. Short on time? Here’s how to spend one day in Ljubljana"
225,"As a self-confessed Francophile, I’ve had my fair share of adventures through the French countryside and my beloved Paris. But every year without fail, I cannot help but to escape to France again and again, each time discovering a new city or town to add to my list. Here we have 20 of the most incredible places to visit in France, each of which I’m sure you will find just as magical as I did!  Favourites always come first for me and suffice it to say that my visit to Annecy a couple of years ago quickly shot this city to the top of my list. Many dinner party conversations have subsequently centred around the city of Annecy and I’m always more than keen to share every detail from my goat’s cheese salad for lunch to the paddle boats on the lake! Read more: Is this the cutest town in France? Why you need to visit Annecy!  I knew before I arrived in Colmar that this would be a town I would fall in love with. The unique blend of French and German architecture in Alsace is just too beautiful to be ignored, so I had Colmar on my travel list for years before I finally had the chance to visit. This town is best explored in the warmer months, as the shoulder season tends to be cold and wet and the winter seasons is dreary and grey. Summer however – you can’t go wrong! Read more: This is the Prettiest town in France  Southern France has no shortage of cute towns to discover and Viviers is no exception. One of the best ways to explore the region is by river cruise (as I did with Avalon Waterways) or you can opt for the tried and tested rental car and exploring the region by land. Quaint towns in Provence are easy to come by, so be sure to allow a few extra days in your travel plans to stop and explore a handful.  The French city that surprised me most was Lyon. Until I began cycling around the city and eating my way through the many charming cafes, I had not realised that Lyon is in fact considered to be the gastronomic capital of France… even above Paris! This is a great city to explore for a few days and has so much more to offer than originally meets the eye. Read more: A Complete Guide to Lyon  After cruising through Provence I made my way further North (towards Paris) and stumbled upon a few gems in the Burgundy region. One such gem was Chateau de Cormatin, an historic chateau that had been renovated and restored by a local family who saw it as their dream to re-open the chateau to the public for a living history lesson. Très magnifique! Read more: Visiting Chateau de Cormatin in Burgundy  No list of the best places to visit in France would ever be complete without mention of my one and only true love in this lifetime: Paris. The French capital is every Francophile’s dream – incredible French cuisine, music, art and history all at your fingertips. Read more: 30 Beautiful Hidden Locations in Paris  It was a few years ago when I first visited Beaune and although I loved every inch of the city then, I fell even more in love with it the second time around. Perhaps because my second visit was timed with market day (Saturdays in France), when the city really comes to life with a sense of community, centring around the one thing that means the most to the French… fine food and great wine! Read more: A Provence and Burgundy River Cruise  The South of France is not where I expected to find one of the most charming little French villages, but I would be lying if I said anywhere is as quaint and quintessentially French as Eze. Read more: Exploring the French Riviera by Vespa  Known mostly for its film festival, Cannes is a great starting point for exploring the French Riviera or a base to do a few day trips in area. Great stops along the coastline include Nice, Eze, and onwards to Monte Carlo, Monaco! Read more: Exploring the French Riviera by Vespa  If you’re anything like me and you’ve visited Paris one too many times to always fill your schedule, then consider a day trip or a short weekender in the Loire Valley, not too far from Paris and with so much countryside appeal. Immerse yourself in history by visiting the many public chateaus or make your way to a vineyard and take in the picturesque views. Read more: Checking in to a Manoir in the Loire Valley  Another great day trip from Paris that can easily be done in a day is to venture to the Chateau of Versailles and take a walk through French royal history. The gardens are seasonal and absolutely worth a visit if you’re in France during the warmer months – but regardless, the chateau is open year-round and an absolute must do.  If visiting a chateau is not enough for you and you’d rather picture life living inside one, then look no further than the medieval style Chateau de Bagnols, a short drive from Annecy. Waking up in the French countryside is about as magical as it gets, let alone inside a regal chamber inside your very own chateau! Read more: Checking in to Chateau de Bagnols  As the gateway to the Alsace region, Strasbourg really surprised me and quickly became one of my favourite cities in all of France. With German and French influence in almost every aspect of life (cuisine, language, architecture), it really is a unique city that brings together two of my favourite cultures, especially during the festive season with one of the most gorgeous Christmas markets you will find in Europe! Read more: A Quick Guide to Strasbourg  One of Paris’ best kept secrets is often over looked by travellers and somehow (even in the age of the internet) so underrated! Chateau de Bagatelle is a small and quaint chateau with gorgeous gardens – a perfect summer escape from the busy streets of Paris. Read more: Visiting Chateau de Bagatelle  In just ten kilometres from the centre of Paris you can reach one of the most glorious chateaus I believe in all of France- Chateau de Sceaux. If you chance your visit during April, be sure to keep an eye on cherry blossom season as the gardens turn a shade of pastel pink! Read more: The 7 Best Day Trips From Paris  North of Paris you will find one of the best day trips from the capital – Chateau de Chantilly. This is also the chateau of the last king of France, which perhaps explains the oversized mote surrounding the castle! Read more: Visiting Chateau de Chantilly  Located on the Rhône River in the Provence region is a small, unassuming little town with so much charm it is forgivable to pinch yourself! Arles is also a great insight into Roman influence in this region of France, with a huge amphitheatre almost in the centre of town that still remains very well in tact.  If the Rhône River is on your bucket list, then look no further than the perfectly picturesque town of Tournon. Not only is this a great base to explore nearby vineyards and scenery, but also the hometown of Valrhona chocolate, considered by chefs to be the most premium chocolate in the world!  This island commune in Normandy is as pretty as a postcard! Mont Saint-Michel has long been a favourite for photographers who flock to capture the unique and charming town.  Last of all, the famous wine-loving city is hard to beat, especially if you love a good grape! Bordeaux is the top choice for foodies and wine lovers… its just a bonus that it (like all cities and towns on this list) is easy on the eye! Over to you! Where is on your France bucket list!? I travelled from Melbourne to Paris with Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong. This has been my preferred route for a few years now and gives me another excuse to stopover in HK, one of my favourite cities for a short stopover. Thanks to Cathay for including me in the #lifewelltravelled campaign."
226,"As a young girl Paris was always the city I dreamed of visiting – with the romantic tree-lined streets, picnic goers people watching along the Seine, the Eiffel Tower glistening in a blanket of night sky, cabaret shows in the late evenings… you name it, I envisioned it. Having now visited Paris a handful of times (I can recall six times to be exact), I have learned first hand that it is not always the easiest city to get a grip on, however strongly believe that if you know what to expect before you arrive, you can only have the best experience in the city of lights. To ensure you have a great time on your first visit to Paris, here are a few hand hints: the most common mistakes of what not to do in Paris!  The French are fairly tolerant when you consider the amount of visitors who flock to Paris each year, speaking a foreign language with various accents, often sounding like gibberish to the untrained ear. Imagine it like this: if you had a guest from a foreign country enter your restaurant, hotel or shopfront and welcomed them in your native tongue, only to have them respond in a stream of foreign words, you too would feel quite confronted or at least feel comforted by the question of “Do you speak English?” or “Parlez vous Anglais” before you begin your rant. A few simple words like Hello (Bonjour), Sir/Madam (Monsieur/Madame) and Thank you (Merci) will go a long way in Paris – if at the very least to show your respect for the language and location you’re in. Before arriving in Paris at a young seventeen years of age, I had absolutely no idea or comprehension of the sprawling metropolis that would lay ahead of me. One thing is for sure: Paris is huge. I suppose in my teenage naivety I expected everything to be small and walkable, with the Eiffel Tower a stones’ throw away from the Louvre and the artist neighbourhood of Montmartre just around the corner. How wrong I was! While the best way to see Paris is on foot, you will need to utilise the Metro to get around town. I would not recommend taxis or car rental as the streets are crazy and often jammed with traffic, making your journey a much more stressful and time consuming one. Sure, Paris is expensive… but not as expensive as it once was and certainly not so expensive that you can’t warrant a good hotel or apartment in a central location. If you really want to experience Paris for all that it is, you really must stay central and allow yourself to wander out onto the streets in the early morning before the city wakes up and well into the evening when the city comes to life.  On that note, it is important to know before you arrive in Paris that not everything is expensive. Sure, a visit to Paris doesn’t come cheap – but most capital cities in the world bring hiked prices and if you know where to go to avoid these, you’ll be able to afford more than you anticipated. Many of the attractions are free – such as the museums on the first Sunday of each month and oodles of public gardens to explore. It wouldn’t be a visit to Paris without croissants, baguettes and bottles of champagne at the Eiffel Tower. It also wouldn’t be Paris without queuing for hours to access the best views over the city, from the Eiffel Tower to the Arc de Triomphe. And it certainly wouldn’t be Paris without the purchase of at least one kitsch souvenir – be it an Eiffel Tower keyring or a miniature French flag. So long as you have more than two full days in Paris, I would entirely recommend making a half day trip from Paris to the Palace of Versailles, just a short train journey outside of Paris. Much of Paris feels like a timewarp – the gorgeous tree-lined avenues, the chic bars and people watching cafes… but nowhere allows you to step back so far in time with such preservation as Versailles Palace & Gardens.  Its true: often the best food in Paris will be found at the swanky restaurants you need to book weeks or months in advance. But just as often some of the best food in Paris will be found at street food stalls, hole-in-the-wall cafes, French patisseries… you name it. Here are the 20 Best Cheap Eats in Paris. I’m sorry to burst your bubble here, but the Champs Elysées is good for nothing more than crowd nudging to make your way through to the Arc de Triomphe. The shops here are all international brands you can find at home and the restaurants are either overpriced or underserving on quality… usually a combination of both! Leave your bumbags, sneakers and visor caps at home… Paris is best enjoyed when you blend in and by Paris terms, that means dressing up! As soon as you are scouted out as looking like a tourist you can rest assured you will be hassled in touristy areas by scammers or pick pockets, so be sure to do your best to blend in. Read more: How to Dress like a Parisian. It took me a few 10 euro bottles of water to realise, but my loss is your gain. Parisian tap water is absolutely fine to drink and absolutely free upon request. All you have to do is ask for a carafe d’eau, et voila! "
227,"Known as the land of fire and ice, it is not difficult to see why Iceland has become one of the most sought after travel destinations the world over. Characterised by dramatic landscapes, volcanos, hot springs and lava field, the trip to Iceland is an adventure of a lifetime. Here are the 10 places in Iceland you can not miss. An isolated seafront village in south Iceland, Vik is as dramatic and ethereal as Iceland gets. Think a seafront village but with black sand beaches, offshore rock formations and changeable weather that will leave you expecting the unexpected. Don’t let the name intimidate you; this canyon in southeast Iceland is a must visit for any first time visitor to Iceland. You might recognise the dramatic cliffs that make the way for winding water beneath, as this has quickly become one of the most recognisable photo spots in all of the country. Located on Iceland’s popular coastline is a beach like no other – a beach you could only find in the cold climates of Iceland known as Diamond beach. The beach is located on a small section of the Breiðamerkursandur glacial plain, located directly opposite the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon. It is here where icebergs wash up on shore and set the scene for a dramatic backdrop to your photos. When you first think of Iceland you probably think of the Blue Lagoon. This thermal hot spring a short drive from Reykjavik’s airport has become an Instagram sensation – so much so that you’ll need to book a trip to the blue lagoon weeks before your visit to secure a spot. The blue lagoon is busier than ever, so if you’d prefer to check out something less commercial, consider visiting the local’s favourite Reykjadalur Hot Springs, a free alternative to the Blue Lagoon. When I travelled to Iceland last year I began frantically planning the trip just a few days out, as I made the choice to visit Iceland as a stopover between Barcelona and New York City, given the favourable airfares with WOW air. I quickly came across photos of the plane wreckage at Sólheimasandur, which has now become a must visit on many travellers’ itineraries. The plane wreckage has become so popular that to avoid erosion of the road leading to the beach, you now have to park near to the highway and walk to the wreckage (a few hours return, depending how quickly you walk). Be sure to pack a head torch if you are starting the walk later in the day, as once the sun has set you will need to make your way back to the car park in pitch black darkness. The trail is very exposed so if you are visiting outside of summer, be sure to pack for all weather conditions as Iceland is known for having a sharp temperament! I’ve long wanted to visit the capital of Iceland, Reykjavik, probably since my teenage years. It was back then when I was obsessing over folk singer and Icelandic national Bjork (were we all?) Reykjavik has changed a lot over recent years but it is still possible to find that small-town magic. That is, if you know the right streets! Knowing the right streets means you can discover the best coffee shops. And when you know the best coffee shops, you find the best food too. I would allow two days to explore the capital of Iceland. From Reykjavik you can comfortably visit the Golden Circe highlights in just one day. This makes it a great day trip from Reykjavik. A graceful waterfall in Iceland’s southeast coast, Seljalandsfoss is an easy pitstop. It is located right by Route 1 and the road that leads to Þórsmörk Road 249. Waterfalls and Iceland go hand in hand. Your next pit stop should be Kirkjufellsfoss, or ‘Church Mountain Falls’ as it is also known. This waterfall is considered one of the most photographed in the entire country, despite its remote location. It is just a short drive near the town of Grundarfjörður. I know I know, another waterfall! Iceland is full of them but each of the waterfalls listed is unique. I promise you, the magic won’t wear off! Gullfoss is located in Iceland’s Golden Circle and can be reached in just under two hours drive from Reykjavik. If you’ve ever watched the Walter Mitty film you’re probably getting the same vibes from this photo! The magic of Iceland is often not in the destinations themselves, but the journey to them. The most exciting thing about travelling to Iceland is how quickly and frequently the weather can change. One moment you will be driving through a snowstorm and the next you will be greeted by blue skies."
228,"It may come as a surprise to you that Montenegro is brimming with luxury hotels. Many of these are destinations in themselves. When I visited Montenegro I had no idea what to expect. I most certainly wasn’t expecting a sort of Venice meets St Tropez. But that is perhaps the most accurate comparison of my stay in Montenegro! One of the first things I noticed is that Montenegro is quickly becoming a hot spot in Europe. I heard from a number of locals that British residents were flocking to buy real estate. And after around one week in the country, I could really see why. It is beyond beautiful from the inside out. Luxury hotels in Montenegro are refined and opulent, often located in charming towns and villages. This allows you to never forget the culture and heritage of where you are. These are the best luxury hotels in Montenegro, perfect for your honeymoon or luxurious weekend away! The Regent Porto Montenegro is one of the most carefully thought out hotels in to wear the five-star crown. The hotel is uber luxe from the moment you arrive. Bell boys, welcoming reception staff and management are all on hand to ensure you have a memorable stay. Porto Montenegro is the leader in luxury tourism in Montenegro. There’s a huge yacht marina and exclusive yacht club throwing international parties throughout the year to their refined guest list. Palazzo Radomiri is the kind of luxury you can only get from a family-run hotel. Located in between Kotor and Perast, the hotel is in the centre of everything. All the while it exists far enough away to feel secluded and away from the visiting crowds. Be sure to request a waterfront view. One of the newest comers to the scene is The Chedi at Lustica Bay. While much of Southern Montenegro has been developed, this area is one of the newest. When I visited the hotel was still being built and there were very few guests. Even the port dock had only a handful of yachts, though I’m sure this will become popular soon. The hotel is part of the Leading Luxury Hotels of the World. If that doesn’t set the standard, I don’t know what does! Located in the idyllic town of Perast, there could be no better location for Iberostar Perast. It is here where many international guests come to hide away in a luxurious setting. The hotel has been recently refurbished but maintains all the history and heritage it had from the beginning. Perast is perhaps the most idyllic town in the entire country, making this a great choice. Most of the tourism industry in Montenegro is focused in the south of the country. However, there’s still a lot to discover in the North. Hotel Bianca is the perfect ski resort for a winter visit. If you visit during the summer, this is a great base to hike in Durmitor National Park. The prices are reasonable for this level of luxury, so it won’t break the bank. Last but not least, the luxurious Aman Sveti Stefan is located on a private islet off the southwest coast. It is located just a short drive from Budva. This hotel is as luxurious as they come. Unsurprisingly, it comes with a price tag only a few of us could afford! While I didn’t stay here throughout my visit to Montenegro, I can imagine it is perfect for a special occasion. The hotel is renowned for hosting honeymooners and couples."
229,"Europe is filled with fairytale castles that will leave you feeling the magic in no time. I will never forget standing at the base of Neuschwanstein castle for the first time, feeling like a princess myself. Ever since that moment I have been chasing more castles around Europe. If you are planning your European adventure, these are the prettiest castles in Europe you must visit. On the shores of the idyllic Lake Geneva lies Chillon Castle, a castle so old that the exact date of the castle’s inception is unknown. There are however records dating back to 1005, which makes it one of the oldest castles in Europe. Today this is one of Switzerland’s most visited landmarks. The lakeside location cements Chillon Castle as one of the prettiest castles in Europe. If we could choose just one castle as the most beautiful in Europe, it would have to be Peleș Castle in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania. This Neo-Renaissance castle near Sinaia was strategically placed on a medieval route that linked Transylvania and Wallachia. It is also one of the least visited castles in Europe. This is due in part to the remote location of the castle, and because Romania remains a hidden gem. Be sure to add this country to your bucketlist before it becomes too popular! Surrounded by an ethereal forest, Eltz castle was built in the 12th-century. It has an eery appeal that welcomes visitors throughout the seasons, however, it can be quite mysterious in the low fog. The forest comes to life in various shades of orange through fall and in winter the castle is surrounded by misty clouds. Over in Transylvania you will find the real life Dracula’s Castle (formally known as Bran Castle) where it is said Vlad the Impaler may have spent a night or two or even may have attacked it once (depending on what you’ve read). Whether the legend is true or not, the castle has a spooky feel to its which only adds to the fun of it, along with its’ isolated location in the misty mountains of Romania. This 13th century castle on the shores of Lake Thun is one of the most beautiful castles in all of Europe, especially when viewed from the lake itself. The castle is moated which only makes it more ethereal and to this day is one of the most visited sites in Switzerland. This 19th century palace in the south of Germany was the childhood residence of King Ludwig II of Bavaria who later built his own castle nearby (Neuschwanstein Castle). When he moved from his childhood castle to his own castle, Neuschwanstein, King Ludwig had the vision of creating a Romanesque Revival palace in honour of Richard Wagner. The castle was his home until his death in 1886 and shortly thereafter opened to the public. Since then the castle has welcomed more than 61 million visitors with around 1.3 million visitors coming to Bavaria to visit the castle each year. Located in the Scottish Highlands, Eilean Donan Castle is one of the most photographed landmarks in all of Scotland and indeed, a favourite for postcards. The castle has been a backdrop for many Hollywood films, including Made of Honor starring Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan. Located high above the city of Edinburgh is one of Europe’s most accessible and centrally located castles. As the name suggests, this castle is located in the heart of Edinburgh. Not only is this one of my favourite cities in Europe, but it is also very underrated. For one reason or another, this city remains somewhat off the beaten path! The castle is situated on top of Castle Rock and arguably has the best viewpoint over the city. Be sure to allow yourself at least a week to explore Scotland. If I ever get the chance to return, I’ll be making it two! In typical Romanticism style of architecture matched with vivid colours and painted terraces, Sintra Castle overlooks the city of Sintra. This castle has sweeping views beyond the small city to the countryside in the distance. I will never forget the eery drive up to the castle. You will pass through mystic forests that feel like other-worldly. The castle has a unique history given the fleeing of the Portuguese royalty to Brazil during the revolution."
230,"On a mission to find the prettiest and most charming towns in France, it was inevitable that our itinerary would soon lead to Strasbourg. Located close to the border between France and Germany in the Alsace region, Strasbourg is a unique bled between the two influences in a range of ways, but most noticeably in architectural and culinary influences. If you’re visiting Strasbourg for the first time, here is your complete guide to Strasbourg to help you plan an unforgettable escape.  For our stay in Strasbourg we were nearing the end of our Spring European journey, so we decided to check in to the centrally located Sofitel Strasbourg for a couple of nights to explore the small city and surrounds in the Alsace region of France. The hotel had a great location just a two minute stroll from the major shopping area and a maximum of five minutes walking to reach the Strasbourg Cathedral and La Petite, the most picturesque part of town. I’d recommend this hotel if you don’t mind a chain hotel and are looking for something central and good value for money, but it was the buffet breakfast that really sold it for me! Their scrambled eggs on toast are to die for.  The city itself is incredibly picturesque, but once you have wandered around for a few hours to take it all in you will still find plenty to do, including: This cathedral is impressively large and as such, you really can’t miss it. Located in the centre of town, the 15th-century cathedral is impressive both inside and out, so be sure to stop by on your visit to Strasbourg. If you’ve seen the picturesque photos of Strasbourg and that is what has inspired you to come here, then you’ll find this picture-perfect part of town in La petite France, the most charming little district to wander around any day of the week. Completely free and with a great view of the town, barrage vauban is an iconic bridge built in the 17th-century. Another great way to see Strasbourg as a visitor is to jump on board the boats that cruise around the river and offer impressive views of the iconic Strasbourg architecture. If you’re more of an active person and would prefer to clock up some kilometres on a bicycle, the city offers a bike rental service for 20 euros per month. You likely won’t need it that long but the price is impressive nonetheless!  With the unique blend of France meeting the German border not only comes stunning architecture, but also an incredible mixed cuisine between the two countries. You’ll see plenty of German influence such as bratwurst, pretzels, and pleeeeeenty of breads. French pastries are an absolute highlight of Strasbourg too, though you really need to know where to go to get the best in town. Naegel is by far the best patisserie in town and for macaron lovers, you won’t find a better macaron in town than those on offer at Elisabeth Biscarrat.  Getting to Strasbourg is easy from both within France and further afield in nearby Germany and Switzerland. From Paris you can reach Strasbourg in 2.5 hours on the TGV high speed train. Deutsche Bahn also service the town with more connections from Germany. Strasbourg International Airport is the cities’ major airport, however flights are scarce for international visitors. Alternatively Basel is the nearest airport after that, which offers great connections throughout Europe. As Strasbourg is the capital of the Alsace region it is a must visit, however there are many great towns to visit beyond this city. Colmar and Egusheim are two of the most talked about towns in all of France and being that they are so close, make sure you don’t miss them!  With thanks to Sofitel Strasbourg for welcoming us to the hotel to experience Strasbourg!"
231,"If I could name just one location in Montenegro my favourite, it would be the idyllic fishing village of Perast. Located just 20 minutes by car from popular Kotor, Perast feels like a hidden gem. It is neatly tucked away from busy Kotor, making it a great alternative for travellers who prefer solitude. If you’re wondering how to visit Perast, this guide will help you plan your stay! Perast feels like a fusion between Lake Como and Venice, especially when dazzling in the summer sun. Here is our complete guide on how to visit Perast. Our tips will help you make the most of your time in this idyllic town in the Bay of Kotor. If you find yourself in Montenegro, chances are you will plan to visit the Bay of Kotor, a bay that is home to some of the most beautiful towns and villages in the entire country. Perast is just 20 minutes drive from Kotor, the most popular tourist destination in Montenegro. The easiest way is to self drive, though if you are feeling up for it and the weather is nice, it is a beautiful cycle along the bay to reach Perast from Kotor. If you have Dubrovnik in your travel plans across the border, then a trip to Perast is easy enough as a day trip and will only take you two hours by road (maybe a little more with border crossing times in summer). Once you have arrived in Perast, you will soon see that it takes only an hour or so to explore the entire town – including time to venture up the stairs for views over the bay and the city below. A great activity that is a must-do in Perast is to board a water taxi for 5 euros. From the mainland, you can make your way to the man-made island, Our Lady of the Rocks. Because of the idyllic setting of Perast, I was certain the prices for food and drinks would be astronomical. The good news is, they were not! My favourite eatery (and I visited a few) was at Admiral Restaurant, right in front of Admiral Hotel. I was surprised to see they didn’t have great reviews online because both the food and service were stellar. Another great restaurant I dined at was Hotel Conte. Located in front of the famous hotel, this restaurant is regarded as one of the best in Perast. The grilled goat’s cheese salad comes highly recommended!"
232,"Paris for me is Paris in the 20’s, through a lens of Woody Allen level nostalgia and with A Moveable Feast in mind. Thus it probably comes as no surprise to my readers that I made it a mission on this trip to Paris to uncover the secret passages of Paris, the history behind them, and spend too much time sipping on a cafe au lait with a crunchy pain au chocolat in hand. The passages are a nostalgic glimpse in the cities’ past, before the days of modern shopping malls and convenience stores, when small boutiques and artisans weren’t just highly prized, they were the norm. There were originally more than 150 of these passageways around Paris in the 18th and late 19th centuries, however most of them were sadly demolished during modernisation and only a handful remain. The passageways that remain today are more than listed here, but these were my absolute favourite passageways that I wanted to share with you in the hopes that you visit and see Paris through my lens of the golden days!  For sure my favourite passageway and I dare say the most glamorous remaining today, Galerie Vivienne is a popular pitstop for locals and their miniature pooches, looking for artisan goods and services in the heart of Paris. Located right by the Palais Royal Theatre, this gallery in the second arrondisement of Paris is an almost perfect display of polished wood, ample natural light and wrought iron. 4 Rue des Petits Champs, 2nd arrondisement  With antique signs laced with gold foil and a train restaurant reminiscent of the Hogwarts Express, Passage des Panoramas is a close second favourite for me given its similarities to Diagon Alley (yup, hopelessly devoted fan over here!) This is one of my favourite places in all of Paris for a completely nostalgic kick, and with companions it would be the perfect place to sit and enjoy for hours over a long lunch. 11 Boulevard Montmartre, 2nd arrondisement  My third favourite passageway I found in Paris is located in the 9th arrondisement, conveniently located opposite the Passage des Panoramas (although the locations are two separate arrondisements, they are literally on opposite sides of Montmartre Boulevard, facing one another. This Passage offers a cute boutique hotel at the finish line, completely reminiscent of life in Paris during the 1920’s. 10 Boulevard Montmartre Boulevard, 9th arrondisement  I stumbled upon Galerie Vero-Dodat by chance, walking around the louvre for a bite to eat. This happens to be one of the quieter passages in Paris, so is great for a photo op with those iconic black and white tiled floors. 19 Galerie Vero-Dodat, 1st arrondisement  Over to you! Have you visited more of the secret passages of Paris? Which was your favourite?"
233,"I recently announced that St Petersburg was my favourite city in all of Europe (see the others here). It is a city I only visited for a few nights, thus it is a city I am eager to return to, but my all too short time there was unforgettable to say the least. If you find yourself looking for a new adventure to unfold in Europe, I highly suggest you venture East and specifically to Russia, as there is so much history to tap in to… particularly in St Petersburg.  Whilst it might seem impressive from the exterior, trust me when I say the interior of the Hermitage opens up a whole different world. As one of the world’s oldest museums, it is today home to a collection that rivals bigger names like The Louvre in Paris, and to some is regarded as more impressive! Located on Nevsky Prospekt is a small painting market I stumble upon when walking from one pit stop to another, trying to rely on a hand drawn map from a kind Russian man I had met on the plane to Moscow. If you’re looking for an authentic souvenir to return home with, here is where you will find something incredibly unique. Of course you will also find the tacky stalls… though how could you go wrong with one of those faux fur Soviet hats!? As the original citadel of St Petersburg, the Peter & Paul fortress is a fabulous insight into the history of St Petersburg for first time visitors. It was founded in 1703 by Peter the Great and is an incredible fortress by any standards, so be sure to have your cameras at the ready!  Due to my short amount of time in the city of St Petersburg, I didn’t have enough time to warrant two day trips, so I chose to visit just one palace outside of the city – Peterhof. After exploring so many countries and cities in Europe you would think I would have had enough of palaces, though this is one such palace that truly deserves a visit, no matter how well travelled you are. The gardens are incredible and full of “trickery” – like fountains that surprise and squirt you, showing Peter the Great’s humorous side as he entertained his guests. Russian food and Eastern European food in general tends to get a pretty bad wrap, considered to be centred around meat and carbohydrates. Though this is true for the most part, it doesn’t mean there aren’t some delicious local dishes for you to try! Dumplings are about as Russian as you can get by way of food, so be sure to sit down for a hearty lunch amidst your explorations on foot (that way you can walk them off in the afternoon!) Whilst walking around the city of St Petersburg I happily stumbled upon the Summer Garden, a garden that was created for locals in the city to enjoy the summer sunshine while it lasts (those Russian winters are h-a-r-s-h!!!) Though I hadn’t planned to visit it, I was pleasantly surprised to take a stroll through and would highly encourage you seek it out if visiting St Petersburg during the warmer months!  During my stay in St Petersburg I was lucky enough to be staying right beside St Isaac’s Cathedral (at the Four Seasons Alexander Palace) and talk about location, location, location! This Cathedral is one of the cities’ main attractions so be sure to stop by for a walk through and if time permits, drop in to Xander Bar at the Four Seasons for a classic cocktail in typical old school Russian-cigar-room surrounds. One souvenir I knew I wanted to return home with from Russia was a Faburgé egg, though whilst shopping for one I remembered I had already purchased one a few years earlier in Kiev, Ukraine, and as gorgeous as they are, 2 would be a little unnecessary. So if you just want to appreciate the unique, regal trinkets and learn the history behind them (it is truly fascinating), then head straight to the Faburgé Museum – a great escape from the cold weather if you’re visiting in winter! To visit any city in Russia and not dabble in a taste of the local vodka offerings would be a crime! St Petersburg is absolutely filled with great bars to duck into for a quick drink, or, if you’re up for a more wild night out the nightlife here is second to none.  As one of the most recognisable landmarks in the city of St Petersburg, a visit to the Church of Savior on Spilled Blood absolutely cannot go missed, even if it is just to gaze in awe at the exterior architecture (Image source). Another great chance to indulge in Eastern European cuisine is to order yourself a generous serve of Russian Pancakes. Unlike the Western World where pancakes are doused in maple syrup and ice cream, Russian pancakes are typically a savoury affair… though you’ll soon find the options for toppings are limitless! Another great day trip and one that I will certainly take on my second visit to St Petersburg is to visit Catherine Palace. Located 30 kilometres outside of the city, Catherine Palace offers another insightful look into Russian royal history as it was once the summer residence of Russian tsars.  Home to world class ballet and opera, the Mariinsky Theatre is a must visit for musical and live art lovers. Tickets are much cheaper here than you will pay in much of Western Europe, so be sure to make the most of it and see at least one show in the evening! (Image source). As mentioned earlier, one of my favourite little finds in St Petersburg was to kick back at Xander Bar, located in the Four Seasons Alexander Palace Hotel. Though overpriced in comparison to other bars in the city, Xander Bar offers a chance to step back in time with a nostalgic approach to its’ decor. This pale blue, white and gold tipped cathedral looks incredibly ethereal in a blanket of snow, though looks equally as charming (and slightly less eery) in the warmer months. If you haven’t seen too many cathedrals yet on your travels in Europe, make this another stop on your visit to St Petersburg. If you’re a bit of a Russian history nerd like me, you’ll likely want to walk out of your way to see the statue of Peter the Great, the Bronze Horseman, commissioned by Catherine the Great. If not? Probably not worth the extra footwork! If you’re interested in shopping in St Petersburg, then look no further than the busy street of Nevsky Prospekt. Although it is constantly overrun with visitors to the city, you’ll find everything you’re looking for an then some on this centrally located shopping street!  "
234,"When you put one of my all time favourite cities with one of my all-time favourite films, you most likely arrive at Amélie, arguably one of the best films of the 21st Century. For lovers of the film who are as die-hard-fan as me, you’ll love these filming locations to visit in Paris which will transport you into the magic of Paris and of course, the magic of Amélie!  Let us begin at one of my favourite scene locations and a hot spot for all fans of the film, the cafe where Amélie herself is a waitress; Café des Duex Moulins. The prices are surprisingly cheap and the cafe is a great little find in the heart of Montmartre. One of my favourite scenes in the whole film is also one of the best locations to visit for it is quiet in the early mornings and a great chance to experience the scene as it appears in the film. Canal Saint-Martin is where we see Amélie skimming stones in the film – the second neighbourhood favourited by the character in the film (second only to Montmartre, of course!) One of the more light hearted scenes in the film is shot inside Gare de l’Est, where you can still to this day go inside a photo booth and take your own pictures to remember your walk across town in the steps of Amélie. Although much of the interior has changed the magic remains with a little imagination! To arrive in Montmartre, take the funicular to the top of the hill and find yourself in the heart of Montmartre, the favourite neighbourhood of the film and where much of the film occurs. Lose yourself in the winding alleys, small narrow streets and transport yourself back to another time in Paris. One of my favourite streets is Rue de Martrys, one of the few “true” streets left in Paris. Whilst in Montmartre be sure to visit Sacré-Coeur and of course visit the old fashioned merry-go-round at the base. Look hard enough and you will indeed find the telephone box from the film with marked with arrows! A walk along Rue Lepic, one of the livliest streets in the neighbourhood of Montmartre, you will recognise some of the smalllocal artisan shops selling fruits, vegetables, meats, cheese and all kinds of specialty goods."
235,"After the cupcake craze that swept America (and beyond) what now feels like an eternity ago, it began to seem as if the idea of a full-sized cake would forever rest in peace to give way to these mini cakes made popular by New York bakeries. Then in a sudden switch of fate, a small almond cookie known as the macaron came out from the woodworks of France (despite recent popularity across the world, these little gems have long been famous in France) and quickly took over as the world’s most sought over a sweet treat. In an age of Instagram and colour pops, the macaron has beaten the odds and stood the test of time: and so it appears here to stay! If you find yourself in the macaron capital of the world, Paris, you’ll need a full guide of where to get the best macarons in the city (and thus the world!) Fear not, we’ve got you covered. I’m going to go against the grain here and make a bold statement: Carette has the best macarons in Paris. Despite what you may have read in guidebooks or been informed by fellow travellers, Parisians will be the first to back me up in saying that the lines at Laduree are not necessarily worthwhile, as you will find equally good (if not better) macarons around Paris at local haunts such as Carette (visit the Place des Vosges location for authenticity – ideally located in Le Marais). 25 Place des Vosges, 75003

236,"Traveling solo for the first time can be a daunting experience, but there is no better continent to do so than Europe. With so much history and culture to discover, European cities provide endless opportunities to learn, grow and explore on your own journey. These 14 cities to travel solo in Europe have been chosen for providing plenty to discover, are all safe to explore on your own and most importantly provide an opportunity to connect with locals and their culture.  Consistently ranking in the top 10 happiest cities in the world to live, Copenhagen is a great city to explore solo thanks to its old world charm, pleasant locals and extremely low crime rate. There is plenty to see and do in Copenhagen, however a few top picks not to be missed are to visit Freetown Christiania (self governed commune), explore the public parks and their effortless gardens, wander along the waterfront at Nyhaven and spend some time being a kid again at Tivoli Gardens.  Connected by 57 bridges, Stockholm is built on 14 islands that interconnect to create one of the most beautiful cities you will discover in all of Europe. With a well-earned reputation for being the most stylish city in Europe, Stockholm is full of beautiful people, palaces, and is a city I would happily return to at the drop of a hat. Exploring this city solo will always feel safe, even at night through the dark (but still so charming) little alleyways.  A longtime fan of Bruges, I’ve even gone so far as to name it the most beautiful city in all of Europe. Located by the sea in northwest Belgium, Bruges has an old-worldly appeal that is nothing short of a fairytale. The winding alleyways that almost always lead to a canal or yet another bridge, the smell of freshly baked pastries wafting through the town square, and the minute details in the intricacies of the architecture are all reasons to fall in love with Bruges. If you’re more of a slow traveller and want to immerse yourself in the city you are in, I’d recommend visiting Bruges for a 3-4 night stay to really get to know the place. Besides, the best of Bruges is when it glitters in the evening! If you’re more of a city-hopper, you can indeed visit Bruges on a day trip from Brussels, Ghent or event Antwerp (connecting trains in Brussels). One of my favourite and most memorable solo adventures was spending 10 days exploring Flanders. I started my journey in Brussels (2 nights) and travelled by train through to Bruges (3 nights), followed by Ghent (2 nights) and finally ended in Antwerp (2 nights). I’d highly recommend centring yourself in one country and exploring various cities with a few days in each, as it cuts out a lot of cross-country travel time and gives you more time to immerse yourself in a culture and really get to know more about that country.  Amsterdam’s hipster scene is alive and thriving, making it a mecca for young digital nomads. This is a great city to travel solo in Europe and my personal favourite. While it may have a notorious reputation for being one of the most expensive cities to visit in Europe, the truth is you can experience Amsterdam on a budget as it is home to some of the best cheap eats, a hostel mecca and if you’re more of an introverted traveller, there are some great AirBnBs throughout the city. There’s so much to see and do in Amsterdam that you’ll need at least a few nights to discover it all! One of my favourite things to do in Amsterdam is to rent a bike for my stay and explore the city like a local. Learn from my mistake: just remember where you parked your bike! There are quite literally tens of thousands of bikes in this city.  It was too long ago that I visited Scotland for the first time and boy did I fall in love big time. As a keen winter enthusiast, I packed my suitcase with layers upon layers for a solo adventure to the Scottish Highlands with my first stop being in Edinburgh, the Scottish capital. Although the Highlands were my destination, my three days exploring Edinburgh almost stole the show! This city is packed with history at every turn and the locals are so friendly that I never felt weird about arriving at a bar or restaurant by myself and almost always left with new friends. Bonus: if you’re a Harry Potter fan this city is full of Harry Potter locations throughout!  If you’ve been following my adventures on Instagram for the past 7 years, you’ll know very well just how much I love (and by love I mean adore) Paris. This city is so full of love and light for me that a few years ago I made the decision to spend every April in Paris. With so many neighbourhoods to explore each offering their own charm, Paris is a city you could spend at least a week exploring solo, getting to know a different ‘hood each day. My current favourites are Le Marais, St Germain and Montmartre.  I first fell in love with Vienna when I was 20 years of age, on my first solo journey through Europe and eager to experience the timeless traditions of this beautiful city that even for me rivals the beauty of Paris! This is also the city that sparked my interest in impressionist art and artists, where I spent days meandering my way through the cities’ many museums. If you’re looking for a multi-country itinerary that will fulfil you culturally, historically and aesthetically, then I don’t think you can beat the central European trifecta of visiting Prague, Vienna and Budapest. These are three of the best cities to explore solo and each are so unique that you’ll pinch yourself to believe they’re only hours apart by train.  With some of the friendliest locals I have met the world over, visiting the capital city of Iceland was on my travel list for a long time and certainly did not disappoint. I was surprised to learn how thriving the vegan scene is here (something I was quite nervous about), but my fears were soon squashed by some of the best raw meals I’ve experienced the world over. The city is much smaller geographically to others named on this list, making it a great choice for those of us who lack direction and would prefer to walk everywhere. Be sure to plan your stay in Iceland to allow for at least a week in the country and adventure beyond Reykjavik after a couple of days. This country is incredibly safe and easy to navigate, making it one of the best choices for a solo road trip.  London is another of my “first” solo travel adventures and it has been a city that I’ve never stopped returning to – there’s just so much to discover. With endless free museums to wander around and the ease of the famed double-decker bus, this city is a great city to explore solo and will never leave you short of activities. One of my favourite aspects of this city is the ever-changing food scene, with countless bakeries, vegan options now having a huge boost in popularity and a strong student population hitting the bar and club scene. When you’re tired of the city be sure to venture out and explore some of London’s best day trips or extend these in to a longer itinerary throughout the United Kingdom. Some of my most memorable solo trips have been through England, Scotland and Wales.  With its gothic intrigue, Prague has become one of Europe’s most sought-after cities to visit. It is also one of the best cities in Europe to discover on your own, especially for those who prefer to walk around a city and discover hidden gems off the main tourist streets. My favourite vegan restaurants in the world were discovered this way (Lehka Hlava and Maitrea) and I’ve spent countless hours getting lost in the streets of the Old Town.  I embarked on my first trip through Greece on board a ship, eager to explore the islands by waking up somewhere new each day. Cruising through Greece also happens to be one of the best ways to see the country solo as it takes out the hassle of lugging your baggage all over cities and towns, many of which are characterised by their cobble stone (and extremely uneven) streets! Mykonos was hands down my favourite stop on the cruise and the first place I’d go back on my next trip to Greece, along with Santorini which I am yet to visit. Lesser known islands like Naxos and Paros were also incredibly beautiful, each of them explorable within a day off the ship.  Zurich is my favourite city in Europe and after three visits I can still say I would return. This city is the perfect size to explore on your own over a few days, stopping in to cafes for a hot chocolate as you brave the fresh air outside. Winter escapes are often my favourite – there’s something so magical about having a city almost all to yourself and it also increases your chance to meet and mingle with the locals.  I visited Delft as a day trip from The Hague but quickly realised this wouldn’t be the only time I visit this charming Dutch town. With all the charm Amsterdam has to offer (canals, bikes, beautiful boutiques and a farmer’s market) but without the crowds, this small city has a lot to offer solo travellers who prefer less hustle and bustle.  About five years ago I named Budapest the most underrated city in Europe. While I still believe this is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, Budapest has certainly made a name for itself over the last five years and is now a “must visit” city on any European itinerary. The city is sprawling and takes some time to explore, so be sure to allow at least four days to enjoy all it has to offer. Apartments and hotels are much cheaper here thanks to an oversupply of vacancies, so this is a great choice to spend a week or two if you’d prefer to slow down and take it at a slower pace.

237,"After some time in Paris we again packed our suitcases, jumped on a train at Paris Austerlitz station and took the slow train to the Loire Valley to check ourselves in for a little French countryside R&R (though to be honest, I never tire of Paris!) We checked in to Manoir les Minimes in Amboise, the last town before reaching the more well known Saint-Pierre-des-Corps. Being a little out of the way allowed us to truly kick back and enjoy local life in Amboise, where we spoiled ourselves with macarons and chocolate eclairs, further stuffing ourselves with crêpes in the evening and walking around town to work it off! For more on our stay in the Loire Valley, read on…  From Paris to the Loire Valley is around a 2 hour train journey from Paris Austerlitz station. This is the slow train so if you’re in a rush there is a fast TGV train running multiple times a day in each direction. There are a number of stops in the Loire Valley as this region stretches out quite a distance. Our station was Amboise as it was the closest to our hotel; Manoir les Minimes. From the station it was a pleasant 15 minute walk in the Spring sunshine to our hotel.  We chose this town as our base in Loire Valley purely because of the hotel itself. Classified as four stars, this hotel is inside a renovated French manoir and has been operating as such for the past eight years. The hotel is renowned for having impeccable hospitality and a more homely feel than you will find in more populated areas in Loire Valley, so it was perfect for our short stay in the French countryside. Our room was located on the second floor (up two flights of stairs), so if you have mobility difficulty I would recommend requesting a room on the ground floor as in typical French fashion, there are no elevators! The hotel has its own restaurant though as we wanted to head out and about to explore, we decided to elsewhere in town, as there are many great restaurants around the region.  The manoir is located in Amboise, a small town in the Loire Valley. The main attraction of the town is to visit Chateau d’Amboise, a fortress that overlooks the small town and out in to the canola fields in the distance. A great way to see the countryside and other towns is to rent a bike at one of the local bike stores (there are a handful in town – you can’t miss them!) Otherwise a car is really necessary to see all the Loire Valley has to offer – which, as you will see, is quite a lot!

238,"Of all the places I have stayed in Ireland, Mount Juliet would have to be one of my favourites if not the most. A countryside estate just outside of Kilkenny, Mount Juliet has a reputation for being one of the most sought after places to stay with a world famous golf course, Michelin star restaurant and the old school Irish charm that makes it feel like a home away from home. After spending a few days in Wexford, I made my way by car to Mount Juliet Estate. The estate is just a short 20-minute drive from Kilkenny city but manages to feel like a world away from reality with the tagline escape everyday. The estate is home to the Manor House (pictured above) and a newer hotel Hunter’s Yard, which is where my room was situated just a short walk from the manor. The Manor House is where you will find the traditional style rooms that date back to the 18th century. These rooms are much more lavishly appointed in Georgian era interior design. It is here at the Manor House where you can enjoy afternoon tea or a 7 course dinner menu at the Lady Helen Restaurant. This side of the estate is certainly more fancy and fine dining, so be sure to dress accordingly! For a more relaxed affair, there are dining option at Hunter’s Yard Hotel next door. It was over here at the Manor House that I spent most of my time. My favourite experience was to sit down for Mount Juliet’s famous afternoon tea. The lavish three-tier affair was an extravaganza in savoury pastries, homemade scones and small treats to finish the meal. You might wish to share between two people – the settings are huge! After the tea, I took some time to wander around the manor house and surrounding gardens. The estate itself is very large, with many different areas to enjoy. There is a professional golf course in the estate that attracts many famous golfers from around the world. This reputation, of course, attracts many amateurs as well, so don’t be afraid to try your hand at a round of golf. You might also enjoy: Monkey Island Estate in England The Georgian Manor House is home to 32 guest rooms, each categorised as 5-star luxury. Over at Hunter’s Yard Hotel, there are 93 guest rooms. This hotel is much larger and caters for the masses, however, it feels more modern than Mount Juliet. If you’re travelling as a couple, the romance of Mount Juliet might be more your style. For families, solo travellers and younger couples, I’d recommend Hunter’s Yard. On my first evening at Mount Juliet, I enjoyed dinner in the Michel star restaurant, Lady Helen. The affair was extremely fancy and as tasty as you could imagine. I had no less than 7 courses to work my way through including this delicious tiramisu taste plate to finish. The restaurant luckily caters for vegetarians and any other food intolerances. Just be sure to let them know ahead of time to avoid disappointment.  A very warm thank you to Visit Kilkenny for organising my visit to Kilkenny and Mount Juliet."
239,"We arrived in the early hours of an Autumn morning to the gorgeous waterfront town of Ålesund, Norway. Immediately my eyes lit up like a child on Christmas morning, as I examined the Art Nouveau architecture from afar and began mentally planning the order of business for the day. Here is your complete guide to Ålesund, one of Norway’s most underrated cities.  Ålesund (pronounced a-le-sund) is surrounded by water, which unsurprisingly results in the town being a major fishing harbour. The city centre has a very unique Art Nouveau style, following a fire that passed through in the first years of the 20th century and resulted in the entire town being rebuilt to the then-current architectural style. This unique mix of intriguing architecture and the dramatic landscape surrounded by water, this town has quickly become a traveller’s favourite for those visiting and touring Norway.  Although a small-ish sized town, you’ll find plenty to keep you busy for a full day exploring Ålesund. Begin with the incredible city views at first light or the end of the day for colourful skies, followed by street meandering, trinket shopping and should you have more time – a day excursion nearby.  If a picture tells a thousand words… then I’m sure you’re already convinced this is one of the best city views you could ever encounter! For sure my favourite part of visiting this town was to take a walk up the 418 steps that lead to Fjellstua viewing platform. The walk is entirely free and begins in the city centre itself, accessible from the town park (Byparken).  As the 1904 fire destroyed nearly the entire city centre, Ålesund, as we know it today, is a modern architectural dream: full of Art Nouveau at every turn. The centre of town displays many beautiful colourful buildings in this architectural style and is well worth a visit for walking and admiring alone. There are daily walking tours for those looking to learn a little more about the city centre, the fire and the subsequent Art Nouveau re-birth of the city.  As the town is fairly compact, it won’t be too long before you stumble upon the gorgeous harbour of Ålesund. Here you can walk around the water’s edge and admire the seaside culture and, if you’re lucky, lap up the summer sunshine! The Alesund Museums is also a great choice to escape the bad weather if you don’t happen to arrive in the city on an often rare day of sunshine!  Alnes Lighthouse – picturesque lighthouse a short drive away. Sukkertoppen – “sugar top” hike. Runde – bird island. See more of our guides to Norway here."

Aynat62 has provided us with \"factual and helpful websites that visitors can use to get updated information\".\\nOne site Aynat noted is https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. This site is a valuable resource of current information for travelers (as well as medical professionals, journalists, policy makers and others).\\nAs cases approach 100,000, one measure of the virus is mortality rate. With the data on the site, the rate can be easily calculated, which today was 3.44%.\\nEdited: 1 year ago Questions and Answers from the World Health Organisation and Harvard Medical School, including questions such as:\\n\"Is it safe to received a package from an infected area?\" - Answer: YES\\n\"Can I catch the coronavirus from food prepared by others?\" - Answer: IT\\'S UNCLEAR YET, BUT COOKED FOOD IS SAFEST.\\nMore questions and answers:\\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses\\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/as-coronavirus-spreads-many-questions-and-some-answers-2020022719004#q9 Aynat: The Q&As you provided go beyond fact to influence awareness.\\nThis is very different. Some core assumptions we have may not apply. And we may have to do willingly substantial things that are not pleasant or convenient.\\nWhatever the details, success requires at all times the use and protection of medical authority. In that effort, which may take many months, its credible voice of scientific fact will unite action, and reassure in a time of uncertainty.\\nAynat, you have promoted this objective worldwide. For that, we are grateful. Thank you.\\nEdited: 1 year ago To add to the valuable research that Aynat offered:\\nHere is a considered response issued yesterday by a large hospitality company on cancellations or changes of plans related to Corona virus concerns of travelers.\\nhttps://touringplans.com/blog/2020/03/06/disney-cruise-line-releases-sail-date-change-policy-in-response-to-covid-19/\\nIt may be helpful to travelers, as well as hotels, airlines, cruise lines, and vendors seeking a reasonable, objective approach as we await further scientific fact, experience and guidance from medical authority.\\nSpecial thanks for the leadership Aynat provided by example in the post.\\n.\\nEdited: 1 year ago The issue of the possible effects of the virus on contracts for hospitality services (hotel, air, cruise, shows, theme parks, etc), and insurance for them, is within the scope Aynat outlined in the Question.\\nInformation on these subjects will be appreciated. Tripadvisor has commendably added an easily-accessible Corona virus data site. https://www.tripadvisor.com/COVID-2019\\nAynat, who is quoted in Post 1, included a separate Corona virus data site.\\nhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\\nHere is a comparison of recent reports from the 2 sites (9:24 PM ET this evening):\\nLink cited in the Question here: Cases: 106,195 Deaths 3,600\\nTripadvisor Link: 103,168 cases 3, 507 Deaths\\nThe point is NOT that one is better than the other--it is that\\n1.

Data reports may differ somewhat in the process. But they are close here--each reporting a mortality rate of about 3.4%--so the public can see that the BOTH sources provide solid reporting and a basis for conclusions, even projections. And the public can have confidence in news reports that provide the same information.\\nAs applied here, under both sets of data and previous rate of growth (approximately 2,000 cases daily) , it would not be surprising if by April 1 there are in the range of 150,000 cases and 5,000 deaths worldwide. (The US figures are too early, and with too many variables, to project now.)\\nEdited: 1 year ago An excellent post by Aynat62! Very helpful info for those visiting NYC Thank you.\\nGood contributions, Little. You \"get\" what this forum is for. I will keep an eye out for any other websites that will be helpful over the next few weeks and maybe months. I find the Johns Hopkins international site showing numbers of the virus all over the world to be of interest. Not sure if it is considered the correct thread to put it in: https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 Hi sweetie. That’s a good one and the figures from that are input to the worldometer website which is what I find a little more comprehensive and includes more data and figures.\\nNo problem adding it here. The Destination Experts and posters on this Forum are here to assist you experiencing the best that New York has to offer. This guide will assist you in using the Forum, and help us to help you.\\n1. Do the initial research yourself. Buy a guidebook, use the internet, lurk on the Forum, ask friends who\\'ve been here. In other words get at least a working knowledge of the city. Find out about the different neighborhoods you would consider staying in, and the attractions you want to see.\\n2. Read the \"Frequently Asked Questions\" on this board. New York changes often, but these will give you a good start, and may even provide the answer that you need. The twelfth MetroCard question of the day does get stale.\\n3. Be specific. Questions such as \"I need a hotel\", or \"does anyone know a good restaurant\" are too open ended. We need to know about you. Things such as budget, length of days staying, the number of people in your party, ages, and interests are essential for a better answer.\\n4. Check back a few times and read all the answers that you get. Sometimes, a simple question can get a simple answer. Other times, there can be a wide variety of opinion. Take it all in.\\n5. Send a trip report. Tell us what you like, and what you didn\\'t. If this Board helped you, you can help others.\\n6. If someone really helped you out, thank him or her. You can even a private message of thanks.\\n7. Finally, don\\'t take advice that you received as the bible. An itinerary is just an outline of what you may wish to accomplish. Allow yourself flexability to add, subtract or change anything during your trip. It\\'s your vacation. Have fun.\\nNew York is a wonderful place to explore, and people posting here do really want to help. Let us help you. Can anyone recommend some day trip ideas from Manhattan via train or public transport in mid December? This will be my 5th visit to NYC and my mums second. Would be keen to visit somewhere that’s either festive or worth a visit for a contrast from the city. We don’t mind adding on a mall or something but don’t fancy visiting Woodbury Common.\\nWe like food, shopping, adventure, outdoor activities (though weather may not line up for this) and most things except museums and history. Don’t mind if it’s a shorter or longer trip as long as it’s doable in a day.\\nThank you! Philadelphia , PA or Mystic , CT (You might have to take Amtrak to New London and Uber to Mystic as New London has more Service) Cold Spring is a cute village 2 hours north from Manhattan along the Hudson River. It\\'s a very scenic journey.\\nhttps://www.coldspringny.gov/home/pages/about-village\\nMetro-North runs train there, not sure about Amtrak.\\nEdited: 5:17 pm, today Following as I am interested in possibly taking a day trip as well. Not sure yet. As mentioned, Philadelphia is the nearest \"big city\" to NYC. They have Christmas events and there is the folksy light show in the vast atrium at Macy\\'s with the world\\'s largest functional pipe organ chiming in at times.\\nhttps://wanamakerorgan.com/christmas-light-show/ There are various places you can get to by the Metro North commuter trains that leave from Grand Central https://new.mta.info/map/5351\\nNorth for a scenic ride along the river valley on the Hudson line to Cold Springs (mentioned above), Poughkeepsie (FDR & Vanderbilt homes with nice grounds for strolling and scenic views & Walkway across the Hudson https://walkway.org/ )\\nTo Connecticut for New Haven (Yale University & interesting college town) Philadelphia would be my recommendation given its close proximity. There is enough there to easily fill two full days so one day should be no problem at all. While I am a big proponent of mystic I don\\'t recommend it in December due to the cold. Besides I think Philadelphia has far more to offer in terms of world class art, American history (independence hall, liberty bell etc) and food.\\nI don\\'t know what you did on your prior trips but if you haven\\'t been I would recommend visiting the NY botanical gardens in the Bronx which has a christmas display as well as little italy. It is still NYC but quite a different experience from other tourist areas and it is especially festive during christmas time.\\nIf you were willing to do an overnight and spend two days I would recommend either Boston or Washington DC. Both have tons to see and a different feel, but I really wouldn\\'t recommend either for a single day trip. The OP says they don\\'t like history or museums.\\nPhilly is fantastic. The centre of the city has an amazing collection of murals\\nhttps://www.muralarts.org/\\nThe Macy\\'s Fox mentions is spectacular - it was originally a Wanamaker and the organ is well worth seeing if you can. We were lucky enough to be taken on a tour of the building.\\nAnother fab site is the Reading Terminal Market.\\nI loved seeing the Liberty Bell and visiting the Philadelphia Museum of Art, but they\\'re not your cup of tea. But the stairs at the Museum are the stairs filmed in Rocky, so you might be interested in seeing the Museum for those. Arrive in NYC on Dec 2 (still need to buy plane tickets), check-in at hotel.\\nDay One - Stroll around the neighborhood the hotel is in, take photos, find a bodega with a salad bar (I love, love, love the hot and cold salad bars in Bodegas/grocery stores) and buy dinner and drinks and head back to the hotel to rest (it may be late in the day and I may be tired from the plane ride). If it is still early, go for a stroll and window shop, take in all of the sights and sounds of the city. Back to the hotel to rest. And maybe write my daily activities on Tripadvisor. ;)\\nDay 2 -- Buy coffee from Dunkin donuts or a coffee cart and a bagel, Go to the Museum of Natural History, stay at least 3 hours, head over to the Strand bookstore. Buy some food and drinks and head back to the hotel to rest for an hour or so. Head back out to walk the neighborhood or take the train to visit a different neighborhood, more walking, and window shopping, maybe visit Timesquare at night.\\nDay 3 - Buy coffee and lox bagel. Go to the main NY Public Library. Do some journaling and reading. Buy some souvenirs (I want some specific souvenirs I will use often), take the train to Brooklyn and the Bronx for some movie filming sites. Take tons of pictures. Lunch and dinner are open to whatever I fancy at the time.\\nDay 4 - Buy coffee and maybe a smoked fish schmear. Go to The Metropolitan Museum of modern art. Stay for a few hours. Head back to the hotel to rest, then go to Central Park and people watch for a while and do some journaling. Dinner is whatever I fancy.\\nDay 5 - Repeat usual breakfast. Maybe get challah french toast for a change. Go to the Tenement Museum (if they are open and if I can get a ticket). Check out The Vessel. Go to Kleinfeld\\'s bridal shop (always wanted to go there since hearing about the annual sale they have and how brides-to-be go a little wild in trying to snag a good deal on wedding dresses). Visit another borough.\\nDay 6 - Maybe go to D.C. for a quick day trip where I visit one or two museums.\\nDay 7 -- Buy more coffee and a bagel, buy some more souvenirs. Visit more boroughs and take tons of photos. Open schedule.\\nDay 8 - Again, more coffee. Maybe find a nice cafe where I can write out my thoughts and things I want to change in my life (I am using this trip as a way to also work on some life goals). The schedule is open to whatever I fancy.\\nSome general things I want to do, but haven\\'t planned them out:\\nFind another interesting museum to visit\\nMaybe have a nice steak dinner\\nDefinitely try some authentic NYC pizza\\nTry Russ and Daughter\\'s food\\nEat dinner from at least 2 bodegas\\nTry some African and Dominican food\\nDunkin Donuts multiple times\\nVisit Harlem, take photos\\nVisit Williamsburg, take photos\\nLook for interesting subway graffiti to photograph\\nBuy dinner from a halal cart\\nVisit NY Stock Exchange\\nVisit some Sex & the City and Law & Order filming sights\\nVisit Carlito\\'s Way and American Gangster filming sights\\nRelax in cafes when possible\\nMaybe try some places recommended by Anthony Bourdain\\nThis schedule is off the top of my head and will be fine-tuned as it gets closer to my trip. I do like to do some things as I feel like it when I wake up in the morning. I want to give myself time to do as many things on the list, but the freedom to switch around the schedule as needed. Have you decided on a hotel? I would pick one and book your flight, December is not that far away.\\nDay 3 might be tough, those are two large boroughs and you have to travel between, etc. -- Springerandy -- I have my hotel and plan to purchase my ticket during the first week of October. I think I may do just one borough a day instead of two. I am going to play it by ear depending upon how I feel. I wouldn\\'t wait that long to book airfare, check out prices and buy when you\\'re comfortable. I usually buy airfare months and months ahead of time because the prices are typically less than waiting.\\nSince you have your hotel, it would be helpful if you listed it, this way recommendations for things close to you can be made. You didn\\'t ask for-comments, but I would just say eating in the time of Covid is not the same as eating from years ago. Some places may not have salad bars and if they do, you may not want to use them. Coffee from carts is usually awful. There are great coffee places now all over the city. You can get DD at home.\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/maps/best-cafe-coffee-shop-new-york-city-brooklyn-queens\\nRuss & Daughters is a good place to get bagel & lox (they’re known for their smoked fish). They have a small cafe in the basement of the Jewish Museum, their own cafe and then their store.\\nhttps://www.fotografiska.com/nyc/\\nis a newish museum that might interest you. When you go to the NY Public Library, the Morgan Library & Museum is close by & is not very big. Have you been to Zabars.? It looks like you would like this place , it’s a deli grocery store on the upper West side. I never miss popping in here on my visit. It’s a treat just to browse around , get some food and souvenirs.\\nFor African food: i can reccomend Ponty Bistro in Harlem. I think it’s at 130th St.\\nt’s Senegalese/ French, and so delicious. A nice candle lit atmosphere. I eat here alone, enjoy it and feel welcomed as a solo diner. I haven’t been there since December 2019. But by all accounts it’s open for dining indoors, take out and delivery. just a quick comment, it looks like you have things planned for different parts of the city on the same day. I would try to group things that are closer together for the most efficient use of your time and energy. Unless your hotel is close to Central Park I don\\'t see the point of going back to the hotel between the MET and Central Park.\\nAs for another museum to visit I would suggest the Whitney. I do agree with blume that you could stop by the Morgan Library which is quite beautiful. The Bronx and Brooklyn are in 2 differnet Directions.\\nAlso the Bronx is not a place I would wander unless you know exactly where you are. Some parts of the Bronx really are sketchy (Parts of Brooklyn are worse, but you are unlikely to go to the Bad parts of Brooklyn) Also with only 7 days I would not do a Day trip to Washington DC, If you want to go to another East Coast Cty, Philadephia is a better bet, Its closer and has good art museums there , Especially the Philadepha Museum of Art (Made Famous in Rocky) and the Barnes Mueum (Ive actually never been inside either of them, Only to the Rocky Steps of the Philadelphoa Museum of Art.\\nRocky Steps / Philadelphia Museum of Art\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPhINmntIJN/\\nLiberty Bell\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPhEToitDgd/\\nIndependence Hall\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPmVC5kNvy7/\\nElfridge Alley, One of the Oldest streets in the USA\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPg0SLPNCuR/ Hi all. My gf and I will be in NYC early December for her 30th birthday celebrations. She is obsessed with Ru Paul’s Drag race. Does anyone know where’s best to catch a drag / comedy show ?\\nCheers Before covid there was someting calls Drag Bingo or something like that, I dont know if it has come back or not since the re-opening Does it have to be a drag/comedy show?\\nI know Seamore\\'s on Mulberry St has a drag brunch thing on Sunday:\\nhttps://www.seamores.com/event/drag-bingo-brunch/ The following might be of interest.\\n- http://www.nycdragshow.com/#dragdining\\n- https://www.dragqueenshow.com/\\nI should also add that there are many gay bars that have Drag night.\\nEdited: 7:33 am, today I haven\\'t been there in a few years, but Pieces Bar on Christopher Street has survived the pandemic. They appear to have developed more of a drag vibe than what I recall. https://www.piecesbar.com/events The drag bingo at Poisson Rouge in the Village was awesome. If it is running it is totally a hoot. Hi all,\\nI wonder if you can help me. Looking at staying in Midtown (Double Tree Metropolitan) or near Central Park (Park Central Hotel). We are travelling fairly light as going to Washington D.C and Williamsburg on the train.\\nWe will then arrive for a 9 night stay in NYC.\\nCan you recommend a good and affordable laundry service? Looking for a same day, wash, dry and fold service. Park Hotel have given me their prices but it is like $14 just for a pair of jeans!! I know I can find a much cheaper service if we do it ourselves.\\nTIA Put the hotel in addresses in google maps and use the \"search nearby\" function\\nYou may need to go a bit east or west to more residential areas but laundries that do same (or next) day service are used by many locals. Pricing by the pound **Put the hotel in addresses in google maps and use the \"search nearby\" function\\nYou may need to go a bit east or west to more residential areas but laundries that do same (or next) day service are used by many locals. Pricing by the pound**\\n+1 I don\\'t know when you\\'re coming, but the DoubleTree Metropolitan looked like it was still closed when I last walked by it, which was a couple days ago.\\nThere are maybe one or two wash and fold places (or maybe a couple dry cleaners that can send that stuff out) in the far east 40s/50s between 1s and 2d. I don\\'t know the names, but have walked by. Also, I heard on my neighborhood board about a place in low 60s around 1st or 2d. There are no self service .places that I know about. A woman in the neighborhood told me she goes down to 14th St to do her Iaundry. I did one day see a small mini van making a delivery to an apt building in that area. Had a short snappy one word name I can\\'t remember. Something clever like \"Suds\" and address painted on van was somewhere like E 14th St. Finding a dry cleaner near your hotel that can send out wash and fold may be the most convenient thing for you, but will be more expensive. I do my own laundry also when I stay in the city since I do long visits .\\nThe same day wash/ dry /fold places are everywhere. The locals know the score : Go east or west to find them as Kaye in Astoria said.\\nHowever, I always I use Yelp to aid in my search .You can search for them on map of Manhattan and read reviews.\\nEdited: 4:08 pm, today If you are in a residential neighborhood these places are like on every other block. Some blocks have multiple locations. I am referring to places that will do your laundry for you. If you want to do your own laundry those places are like several blocks apart, I wouldn\\'t count on same day service and would make plans for next day service. A lot of places since the pandemic have stopped with the same day service because there wasn\\'t enough demand etc but still if you bring it in during the morning they will have it ready for you late the following afternoon. Laundry is often a flat fee for the first ten pounds and then a specific amount per lb after that, so it cost effective to have at least 10 lbs of laundry. You are more likely to find what you are looking for in areas with smaller residential buildings. Larger ones often have their own laundromats in the basement if not in each apartment. In my midtown neighborhood there are no more places where you do it yourself and very few, if any, where they do it for you on the premises. The best available is usually a dry cleaner that will send it out to a wash and fold place. As a matter of fact, I just walked by one -- 320 east 49 dry cleaner -- that has a big sign in window advertising wash and fold and showing big eco friendly bag they will give you to put stuff in. They pick up and deliver. There are also several services in Manhattan that do only pick up and delivery. During the lockdown some people in my building were apparently afraid to use our laundry room and used these services, as I used to see the laundry bags in the lobby.\\nNot long ago I was talking to someone who lives on E 50th, doesn\\'t have a laundry room in her building and prefers to do it herself. She said she takes the bus down to a laundromat on 14th St nowadays.\\nEdited: 5:47 pm, today -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff has removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guidelines with regards to off-topic chat.

Start the day with breakfast, and then visit Ellis Island.Book an early morning time slot for this. Then visit 9/11 memorial, either before or after having had lunch at Nish Nush. Good pick for falafels btw. Very good ones there. I wasn’t aware there was a difference between the Museum and the Memorial. Let me check it out. Thanks. The memorial is the water fountains in the footings of the tower with the names of the (known) dead that have been recovered.\\nThe museum is where they exhibit some of the items recovered If you decide on the 9/11 Museum as well, then your whole day will be thrown out. You\\'ll need a few hours for that.\\nNote that Castle Clinton is in Battery Park, you\\'ll see the round brown building. It\\'s near the SOL ferries, so you\\'ll see that way before going to Stone Street.\\nThe Memorial will only need half an hour to an hour at the most. Take a look at the Survivors Tree. It should be huge by now. The Musuem will need a few hours.\\nIf you decide that you do want to include the 9/11 Museum, maybe forget about going to Liberty Island if you\\'re not going to go into the statue, and just take a ride on the SI ferry. It\\'s an hour round trip and free. I\\'m also confused about Pick a Bagel. I think there\\'s only two locations and they\\'re both way uptown. If you\\'re staying at the Conrad or Gild Hall there are none nearby, unless you know of one? I do want to go into the 9/11 museum. So it sounds like that will take 2-3 hours. So there might not really be time in the afternoon for Ellis Island. May be another day.\\nI looked up Google Maps and it appears there is a Pick a Bagel in the Conrad Hotel at 102 North End Ave. But it sounds like there are lots of good places to grab a bagel in the area if Google is wrong.\\nI’ll have to check the map again for Stone Street. Thanks! +1 for flipping part 1. Do Ellis Island first as lines get worse the later it gets on in the day, get the first ferry of the day (only official seller is Statue Cruises) and you get off at Ellis Island and then the boat goes to the statue - you can choose to get off or not, if not it’ll take you back to Manhattan.\\nEdited: 4:56 pm, today You\\'re right about Pick a Bagel being on google maps in that area! Good one.\\nNote that you only mention Ellis island. There are actually two islands that the ferry goes to. Ellis Island is the second island, and it\\'s the immigration museum. The first island is Liberty Island and that is where the Statue of Liberty is. Please confirm is it only Ellis you want to go to, or is it Liberty Island, or is it both? Both will need 2-3 hours, sometimes more if you like to take your time.\\nOnce you decide on which island/s and also definitely the 9/11 Museum, you\\'ll need to re-arrange things. You won\\'t be able to fit everything in. Sorry my mistake, it’s been some time since I’ve been on the statue cruises boats (we went just after the crown reopened last time) and may be misremembering which order they go to the islands in 😂 No problem. Did you take the ferry from New Jersey? The ferry goes to Ellis first if you leave from there. But if you leave from Manhattan it\\'s Liberty Island first. We are two seniors who have been to New York City a few times as tourists with our kids. We have seen some of the main sights more than once (Ellis Island, Empire State Building, etc.) but this is a nostalgia trip (and probably our last) and we want to concentrate on the things we love best. We\\'d greatly appreciate your help vetting our itinerary below and would welcome any and all suggestions. The meds I take don\\'t mix well with alcohol but I wonder if you could recommend a few places where my husband could have a real cocktail and I could have a fancy fake one after the shows?

Two bedrooms preferable, but can do one bed and pullout sofa. For late October 2021 - I know, last minute! Near theater district ideal, but not opposed to other areas. Thanks in advance! You might need two separate hotel rooms, as your request for a hotel room with two bathroom suites will be impossible in NYC. Even a two bathroom AirBnB will be illegal and/or prohibitively expensive.\\nI’d get two separate hotel rooms and have someone sleep on the couch or a sleeper sofa. The Hotel Beacon on the upper West side has a two bedroom two bathroom suite.\\nthe pod pads hotel in Midtown has a 2 bedroom,two bathroom suite as well.But I am unsure if they’re still available since Covid.\\nhttps://www.beaconhotel.com/\\nhttps://www.podpadsnyc.com/\\nhttps://www.suiteness.com/suites/united-states/new-york/new-york/2_bedroom_suites?\\nThis site may help in the search\\nEdited: 10:45 pm, yesterday There are two bathroom suites with separate bedroom and pull out sofa with kitchenette at the Manhattan Club located at 200 W 56th Street (& 7th Ave). Many of the rooms are timeshares but they do have room reservations. It\\'s less than a 10 minute walk to Times Square. Wow - I stand corrected. Apologies to the OP. Good suggestions for places with 2 bedroom suites.\\nI would also look at what two separate rooms would cost, since these may be cheaper - look into it. Your call obviously depending on how you like to travel and how you like to stay. Or perhaps a combo of one hotel room and one suite if you like areas to socialize in the hotel suit. Look at layouts or inquire about those to see if they fit your needs. Guess it comes down to both budget and how you want to use the rooms. For connecting rooms, try Hilton. At most hotels, reservations for connecting rooms are not guaranteed, but Hilton, since this summer, is confirming that you will get connecting adjoining rooms if you book them. Apparently Hilton now has the ability to determine what connecting rooms are available in advance unlike reservation systems at other hotels:\\nhttps://www.hilton.com/en/connecting-rooms/ Came in here to mention the Manhattan Club, we stayed there for a week in August 2018.\\nOur suite had one bedroom, with double sofa bed in the lounge / Kitchenette. The bedroom had its own bathroom, but there was a second bathroom accessed off the hallway.\\nOur son loved it, as we had the bedroom with en-suite, and he had use of his own bathroom (off the hallway).\\nWe booked it through British Airways holidays at the time.\\nEdited: 7:31 am, today I think AKA Times Square may have some. Look at 2 separate suites at\\nRadiocityapartments.com Radio City Apartments is good, no frills. The Pod Pads only accept stays of 30+ days as far as I know. They are the apartment style rooms with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms. Their regular rooms are for any stay length. Hello, I was wondering if timed admission tickets were the best choice for the museum? We are traveling with our 16 and 19 year old kids. None of us have ever been to the museum. I am not sure if we will explore for the recommended 3 hours. Thanks Definitely buy in advance for all museums/attractions that offer them if you truly want to go I would also recommend buying in advance and budgeting 3 hours. Agreed buy tickets in advance. Even before the pandemic sometimes the museum could get busy. With the pandemic it is important to reserve times for any museum just to be on the safe side if there are capacity caps. You don\\'t have to stay three hours if you don\\'t want but book off three hours and then decide when you are there if you want to leave early. Yes, pre-buy your tickets in advance. I just bought my tickets for my december trip. One can easily spend 3 hours there and it is emotionally intense.\\nYes, purchase ahead of time, but I would also not go too far ahead. The reason being is weather, for example, if you know there may be rain, that\\'s a good time to go to a museum. I know weather can\\'t be predicted too far ahead of time, but check the tickets, are they available within 2 or 3 days? That might help with your planning. I have been looking to book a private transfer from JFK to the Times Square area. I\\'ve been quoted £140 return but I wondered if Uber / Lyft were available to hire from the airport? Have you read this from the first of the \"top questions\" on the right hand side of this page? https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13187699-How_do_I_get_from_the_airport_JFK_LGA_EWR_to_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nIt should answer most of your questions.\\nFYI, you should convert to dollars when asking questions on the New York City Forum...and I think you mean \"round trip\" when you say \"return\"? I would simply take an official yellow taxi. Simple and appr $75 each way. We normally do a yellow cab from the official dispatcher at the designated line into Manhattan and then Dial7 on the way back to the airport. Official yellow cabs are a fixed price and if there is a line, it tends to move really quickly Be cautious about any third party offers - they can be problematic\\nComparison price known reliable car services such as Dial 7 or Carmel I wouldn’t book anything from a third party as Kaye says it can cause a lot of problems. Back when UK visitors could trace the board was flooded with posts about that sort of thing - inc those booked through travel agents and airlines.

Thats the big one many of us are waiting for\"\\nI think that it will remain as vaccinated can have a breakthrough as a few of my friends had recently. I traveled abroad twice this year and I am fine with testing before a flight. It is usually not a hassle anymore. I agree, there should be testing. I would not want to have an asymptomatic infection that infects other people on the plane. I note the link above suggests you have to have just one Covid vaccine before entering restaurants in NYC? Is this correct?\\nMyself and husband will be fully vaccinated, my husband will also have likely had his Pfizer/Moderna booster also however my daughter who will have recently turned 12 will only likely have had 1 as at present The U.K. are only giving 1 vaccine to her age group. Even if govt change their minds not enough time will have passed for her to had her second.\\nI’m keeping everything crossed for our Christmas trip but if two vaccines are required for my daughter, it’s likely to be a no go for us 😧\\nWe’ve travelled a few times during the pandemic and have tested pre/post flights and tested regularly in between and uploaded Apps showing our test/ vaccine status etc so I’m hoping something similar can be adopted but I appreciate rules are rules! I am with ISDW, when will they open the land border to let Canadians enter the US? Hello, we have booked a trip for April with our 2 children who will be 9 and 11. I was last in NYC in 2008 and previous to that 2001. I would very much like to go to the 9/11 museum but am not sure whether I should take the kids. Can I have some advise please. Both children know about 9/11, I know 100% they would be very respectful while visiting but not sure if it is appropriate to take then. Thank you Memorial definitely\\nMuseum doubtful (if you go you may want to skip some parts)\\nRead these to help you decide\\nhttps://www.911memorial.org/learn/youth-and-families\\nhttps://mommypoppins.com/9-11-memorial-museum-kids-visiting-families-tips The museum recommends only children 10 or over attend. I honestly wouldn’t recommend it. I took my 15 year old in 2019 and it is very intense. She was old enough but for me, I’d think 12-13 is the youngest. Beyond the intensity and somber nature….it just hits different for those that didn’t live through it or remember it. I was very emotional throughout. DD was not, though of course it made her sad. Even if your kids could handle the nature of it, they probably won’t be able to appreciate the depths of it and could get bored. I hope that makes sense. It’s not geared towards children. I think that’s why some kids end up acting up, which we did witness on our visit. Not saying at all that your kids would, but you might feel rushed through or like you need to leave without seeing it all. I didn’t even spend as much time as I would’ve liked. I wanted to read everything while DD was content to skim most and see the bigger things. Just natural for those who who didn’t live through it I’m sure. I went a few years back with my then 20 year old son. The visit is apparently 2 hours, both me and my son needed to go out after 30 minutes.\\nAs mentioned by Kaye, some parts of the museum are really difficult. I would not take your children even if they know about the events, the museum is hard to get over even for an adult. Thanks all for your input. We will not visit the museum and will just visit the memorial this time instead. Four years ago I took my then 8, 11, 11, 14 year Olds. They soaked it all up. Of course we had already watched a lot of documentaries. We were planning on going back this week while in town but they aren\\'t vaccinated yet. They all have proof of positive antibodies but I don\\'t think that will work unfortunately. I live five minutes away from the museum. I have zero intention of ever going. It’s too tough for me. It all depends on the person. There is no age limit. It really depends on the children. If it was me I think 9 is too young. 11 can be alright for an emotionally mature child and supportive parent, but I think it can be a bit much for even an 11 year old. Really depends on the child and the parent(s) I also have no desire to visit the museum. I heard that they had thoughtfully provided an exit in the most graphic display for persons who wished to see no more. The museum is well done. I only went because my relative from out of state wanted to see it. The exhibit is designed in away where they make it clear where the more intense exhibits are so that they can easily be avoided if people decide to do so. Just visited Vienna, Austria and fell in love with their Zwickl beer. Most of their major breweries have the Zwickl version, which is a cloudy, unfiltered lager - somewhat similar to the German Wheat or Belgian Wit beer in appearance, except it\\'s not made with wheat. There are some German Zwickls as well.\\nExamples:\\nhttps://www.getraenkebayerkoenigsbrunn.at/shop/bier-%C3%B6sterreich/steiermark/\\nhttps://www.interspar.at/shop/lebensmittel/stiegl-paracelsus-zwickl-6-x-05l/p/8018557\\nAny idea when I can buy such beer in NYC? Hmm... am I the resident beer geek on this forum? Anyway, here goes my response..\\nAccording to RateBeer, \"for any beer calling itself Zwickl, Zwickel. Kellerbier or Zwickelbiers are unfiltered versions of lager or ale styles of European origin. These can include traditional Helles, Dunkel, Dortmunder, Vienna, Bohemian, Kolsch, Alt, as well as less common traditional or contemporary European-origin lager and ale styles. The name Zwickelbier comes after the name of the tap used to sample from a lagering tank.\"\\nMaybe finding an unfiltered helles, or a kellerbier will be easier than the very specific Zwickl.\\nVienna Lager is what a Brooklyn Lager is, but that isn\\'t unfiltered, so that won\\'t count.\\nI was going to recommend Top Hops, but their store is closed now but they do have a satellite location in Essex Market, but not sure how extensive their bottles / cans are.\\nI\\'m not even sure there are any good \"lager\" breweries in the area that I can think of either, so a good bottleshop is what you really need to find things like this.. I\\'m trying to recall if Threes do any good lagers, but it\\'s been a while since I\\'ve been (thanks pandemic).\\nSo, not much use as a response, more of a thought dump and hopefully someone else may know exactly where to go what you\\'re looking for...\\nM **I was going to recommend Top Hops, but their store is closed now but they do have a satellite location in Essex Market, but not sure how extensive their bottles / cans are.**\\nI was also going to recommend Top Hops as I have been there several times over the last few weeks. I was there last Saturday.\\nThey have a pretty good bottle/can selection. I know one of the workers there, but they are not available right now. Meanwhile, want to give a plug to the Austrian capital of Vienna, where virtually every large cafe or restaurant has amazing beer on top, including many local beers. Thanks guys for your thoughts. Will explore. Its better when someone else says it, Mark. Mark from London is the official beer resident of the NYC forum\\nIn addition to Top Hop take a look at Radegast Hall & Biergarten in Williamsburg I was recommended the d.b.a. many years ago by someone on this forum. I see it survived the pandemic (so far) and other blows of misfortune. They have many beers and many dogs. If you haven\\'t been, I would strongly forward the recommendation I was given. It is often my last bar of the trip so I can leave New York on a high note. Lower East Side/East Village depending on your boundaries.\\nEdited: 3:54 pm, yesterday Also try 4th Avenue Pub in Brooklyn.....right next to the Atlantic Ave/Barclays Center train station. Some possibilities that may carry something like that\\n- Stout (various locations)\\n- Keg Room (near Macy’s)\\n- Beer Authority (Port Authority Bus Terminal)\\n- Valhalla - 9th on corner of 54th https://www.newyorkcityurbanadventures.com/new-york-city-tours/dog-friendly-nyc-brewery-tour/\\nNot exactly an answer to your question but I thought it might interest. If we\\'re just now naming bars to visit, Proletariat Bar on St Marks Place would also be a good idea. It\\'s a tiny place, but always has interesting beers on.\\nPine Box Rock Shop in Brooklyn has a lengthy tap list, and it might be worth visiting TØRST in Greenpoint too..\\nM Are you willing to go to Long Island?\\nIn Westbury Long island there is a place called Total Wine and Beer, I dont know if they have this specific brand, but that have the biggest selection of beer Ive even seen, They have tons of Belgian not named Stella Artois,They have lots of choices from other countries as well We are looking for a breakfast place tomorrow morning in either Times Square or Little Italy. Needs to have good hash browns, as well as bagels with locks. Any suggestions? This email just came a day or so w a bunch of breakfast places\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/maps/best-breakfast-nyc\\nSadelle’s for lox. I am on a budget (extra tight as it is a holiday month and I need to set aside money for Christmas presents) and am trying to figure out a reasonable spending limit per day. I have a few items I want to splurge on (clothes, etc.) and tend to buy affordable, non-expensive food when I eat.\\nI will mostly be using the subway to get around. Maybe a cab every now and then. I am thinking that $40-$50 is a good amount to spend each day for food, drinks, subway, and maybe small trinkets.\\nIf you have traveled to NYC, what was your daily spending limit? I am also interested in hearing about other people\\'s spending habits. I want to be frugal, but not so frugal that I am missing out on fun experiences. For example, I just paid $33 for my timed entry for the AMNH. :) I wanted to make sure that I got a chance to visit the Museum again at a slower pace.\\nAlso, I don\\'t drink alcohol and will probably not have any full three-course meals. Focus on your budget, others budgets may or may not help you.\\nFrom all of your posts, you have a lot planned and can actually fill a few months here. My best suggestion, finalize your itinerary and that will help in many ways. It will give you input as to your attraction costs, you can then figure out how you\\'ll be traveling between sites/areas/etc. It will also allow you to do some planning for meals or at least have a general idea of what is within the area where you\\'ll be. Sure, flexibility is needed, but you can plan fairly close in my opinion. ^\\n+1 to all of that.\\nAlso, purchase a Metrocard and your travel expenses will be sorted. Good advice. Honestly, I think in the context of everything else you have planned and what you\\'ve described of your tastes, your daily spending on food will not be a make-or-break thing.\\nWhat\\'s a little confusing is the sheer number of things you\\'ve expressed interest in doing - some of them inexpensive or free, but others rather pricey.\\nOne general tip - it can be a bit easier to eat cheaply when the weather is nice and you can take carry-out or street vendor food to a park and eat/drink it there. Since you\\'ll be traveling when it\\'s cold, you\\'ll probably need - or at least be tempted - to get out of the weather. But ducking into a restaurant or cafe can start to get pricey if you\\'re on a tight budget. Luckily, a lot of private buildings are required as part of their development agreement to keep part of their space accessible to the public for free - so-called \"POPS,\" or \"privately-owned public space.\" Often these are rather nice (if generic) atrium settings where office workers eat their take-out lunches (or did, back when people went to offices). Don\\'t be afraid to make use of them!\\nThis link includes an interactive map to show you where POPS are:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/pops/pops.page Hi Travel chick,\\nI think your $40-$50 a day for food, beverages and maybe trinkets could work if very thrifty. You’ve mentioned That you will use grocery stores, food carts and food trucks, so it could work. I would be prepared to overspend at times, as a tourist with limited time you can find yourself needing something and only expensive options are nearby. You may run of time to bargain hunt. Whether it’s food or gifts.\\nI suggest buying the seven day unlimited metro card for$ 33 plus a buck for the card.\\nI advise against taking taxis at all. Taxi or uber fares take a bit out of q budget. . Buses, subways and walking will keep your transportation budget at $34.\\nExcept for perhaps your airport trip.\\nEdit iCross posted with Linda. I took a long time composing that\\nEdited: 5:57 pm, yesterday On average, it\\'s $100.00 per day for me. Some days I spend less on food and other days I spend more. It averages out at around $100.00.\\nI don\\'t always have breakfast but will always have lunch and dinner. Plus a coffee. Some days I will have a big lunch then a smaller dinner for example. I don\\'t drink a lot of alcohol, maybe a glass or two with my meal.\\n$40.00 to $50.00 per day on food, transit etc is doable but you won\\'t be eating in nice sit-down restaurants. Some entrees will be in the $20.00 - $30.00 range just for one dish in mid-range restaurants. Breakfast can be cheap (a bagel and tea or coffee), lunch can also be inexpensive, but if you want one nice sit-down meal per day then your budget will blow out. If you eat Dollar Pizza Slices and Baglels with creme cheese (about $5 each) its easily done I would rather be pleasantly than unpleasantly surprised at the end of a trip so I tend to overestimate my daily spend, just in case I want to splurge somewhere along the line. In your case, I would probably estimate at least $75 a day and make adjustments elsewhere in my life to cover that. This way, if you can stick to $50 great, but if you splurge and spend $100 or $150 it won\\'t be the end of the world and at the end of the trip you may well have more left than you expected. \"If you eat Dollar Pizza Slices and Baglels with creme cheese (about $5 each) its easily done\"\\nAnd this is why so many people are unhealthy...please note that you can buy fresh fruit sold from carts on many street corners and Duane Reade and most bodegas sell cut up fruit and vegetables fairly reasonably. With the greatest respect Risa, if people want to eat fruit they will find a way to do so. The person who suggested bagels or pizza is simply giving a hot/meal option that would suffice for lunch or dinner at a cheap price point. Fruit maybe works for breakfast or an accompaniment to lunch, it does not solve the main meal. People are not overweight and unhealthy because people suggested on a travel forum that pizza slices or bagels is a good way to save money, they are this way because of their ingrained life habits, so let\\'s not suggest someone has done something wrong by offering these options.\\nEdited: 6:11 am, today Like others suggested $40-£50 a day is probably a bit tight, and you would end up probably not eating, or going out of your way to find a cheap alternative, perhaps being hungrier for longer. This could lead to you ordering more in the end anyway, as you are hungry, negating the savings you could make. Like someone else suggested, budget more and be pleasantly surprised when you save :) - Some days you will be so busy $50 will suffice because you won\\'t have a sit-down meal and potentially won\\'t have one of Breakfast or Lunch, but you don\\'t want to have to rely on that. We\\'re traveling to NYC from Minnesota and planning to visit the Whitney to see Jasper Johns. I\\'ve looked everywhere, but I can\\'t tell if our general admission tickets include the special exhibitions or if we need separate tickets to view them. Can anyone help? Thanks! We\\'ve been to the Whitney a few times and have never needed separate tickets for special exhibits. That doesn\\'t mean they never do it, though.\\nHave you tried calling them? Museums that charge for special exhibits typically are forced (for various reasons too complicated to go into here) to provide basic admission for free or at some low level. So they make money by booking touring exhibitions they can charge extra for. Since the Whitney is a private museum, they have complete control of their admission price, and they never charge extra for specific shows. Good idea! I forgot it is still possible to talk to an actual person. Thanks! Very helpful Thanks so much! Favorable news: While the Met Museum has not opened its water fountains in the gallery hallways yet (although some other museums have done so ...), they have resumed placing a (tap) water dispenser and cups in the seating area of The Eatery. You may know this lower-level space (with no windows) as The Cafeteria.\\nI was just getting ready to write a complaint letter, when I had lunch there yesterday 10/5/21. To get a cup of water, you turn right after paying, and walk about ten feet. Note that they have temporarily eliminated trays, so you might wait to get the water until you have been seated and your hands are free.\\nI\\'m not making an argument for fine dining there. But I often find that it takes too long away from the art to eat in a restaurant on Lexington or beyond. I\\'ll settle for overcooked Falafel-Crusted Cauliflower Steak ($16.50, same price as a pre-prepared green salad with chicken, in a clear clamshell container.) Having approved of the water, I can\\'t endorse paying $30 for a half-bottle (375 ml) of wine here!\\nI included the cost of an average entree mainly because some visitors believe they can spend less at a diner on Madison Avenue. While I want those diners (which have been hurt by Starbucks, for example) to have patronage, it is very hard to get a full plate of food at any Upper East Side \"diner\" for 16.50. Just mentioning. I haven\\'t tried the made to order hamburgers or the trays of sushi at the Met Eatery. That is interesting. I haven\\'t been in that restaurant since the pandemic so was not aware of the change(s).\\nHowever, one thing I am aware of is that the very small diner that was at the corner of 79th and Madison for years is gone, as of at least last winter. Wanted to get a coffee while in the area, just couldn\\'t find the place and finally realized it was gone.\\nEdited: 1:55 pm, today Any recommendations for a non crowded boat trip with kids ages 11 and 9?

Thanks 😊 What do they like to do//interests?\\nWhat days of the week are you visiting?\\nSome options off of the top of my head:\\n-Coney Island\\n-Union Sq(Friday night)...Legendary Cypher..if they are hip-hop fans\\n-Ride the Staten Island Ferry\\n-Walk the Bklyn Bridge\\n-Check the Central Park and BRIC(Prospect Park) concert scheduled - the majority are free\\n-Baseball game Baseball game? There are some off Broadway shows that have been popular with teens like STOMP. For a cruise, look at\\nSail-nyc.com\\nEmpire State Building is open late. In summer there are outdoor movies on some nights. Coney Island for rides. Teens like to hang out in Union Square and Washington Square park. Baseball game, Circle Line Sunset Cruise, Coney Island (you may be able to do a baseball game there with the BK Cyclones), Bowlmor Chelsea Piers (ask has a laser tag), Wander through Times Sq at night (keep your wits about you - do not interact with the costumed people - they will harass you for tips) I was looking for some similar stuff for my 18 year old daughter, and I found Bowlmor (bowling and arcades) and there\\'s also a Dave & Busters. I can\\'t give a recommendation as I haven\\'t been to either one.\\nWe are planning to ride the free Staten Island ferry after dinner one night. I believe they run 24 hours.\\nThere are also several Escape Rooms that have available bookings after 10 p.m.\\nIn July the sun sets pretty late - you could check if any of the observation platforms/towers are open late to accommodate seeing the city after dark. The Summit at One Vanderbilt (opening later this month) looks really cool. Have the teens go to the library & take out a guidebook & let them pick out their own entertainment. **Have the teens go to the library & take out a guidebook & let them pick out their own entertainment.**\\nI definitely agree with this as well as looking on the internet.\\nMe at 16/18 visiting NYC for the first time....I may just want to hang in Union Sq one night. Maybe Coney Island. Or maybe just hang out in the E Village.\\nWithout knowing what your teens like/are interested in, who knows. Thanks for this. Visiting 1-5 July. Got some great recommendations already! 4th of July fireworks https://www.macys.com/social/fireworks/\\nMore of a daytime activity, but the Rockaways, the local surfer beaches, might be of interest https://www.timeout.com/newyork/queens/rockaway-beach-ny (reachable by subway or a ferry ride out through the harbor) My teens loved The Ride!\\nThey also enjoyed Madame Tussaud\\'s and Ripley\\'s.\\nThey did some self made walking tours of things like movie sites,\\ntv sites and a special \"gossip girl\" tour.\\nThey also enjoyed riding the Roosevelt Island tram. I wouldn\\'t walk there, but\\nit\\'s a quick subway ride away! If you’ve been to the Madame Tussaud’s in London I wouldn’t bother with the NY one personally My friend an I are coming to NYC for the first time in late October. We fly into LaGuardia at 4pm on Thursday and fly out at 3pm on Monday. We are trying to get as many sites in during our short trip. I have come up with a list and am working on reservations early for all those that require such. Currently I don\\'t have anything planned for Thursday evening as I am unsure of how much time it will take to get from the airport to our hotel in Midtown. I also don\\'t have anything planed for Monday before we leave. We also could use some suggestions for easy lunch and dinner options close to us each day. Are there any must see places that we left out?\\nFriday Morning\\n9/11 Memorial Museum\\nFriday Afternoon\\nBattery Park\\nCircle Line Sightseeing Tour\\nWall Street\\nFriday Evening\\nCross the Brooklyn Bridge\\nBrooklyn Bridge Park\\nGet Dinner in DUMBO\\nSaturday Morning\\nTake a walk on the High Line\\nEmpire State Building\\nCentral Park\\nSaturday Afternoon\\nMetropolitan Museum of Art\\nFifth Avenue\\nSaturday Evening\\nWICKED on Broadway\\nTimes Square\\nSunday Morning\\nLittle Italy\\nChinatown\\nNew York City Hall\\nSunday Afternoon\\nGreenwich Village\\nWashington Square Park\\nSunday Evening\\nBryant Park\\nSt Patricks Cathedral\\nRockefeller Center Top of the Rock You’ve already got five days worth of stuff planned for three days, so the forty or fifty other things I can think of probably won’t fit.\\nExpect two hours from landing to hotel if you are taking a car service or Uber or cab. In order to give you good dining options we need a budget/entrée & cuisine likes & dislikes.\\nAs for what to do when you fly in, I\\'d see when you get to the hotel how you feel, whether the plane is late & then pick something out of what I agree is a really jammed itinerary so you have some wiggle room on another day. On Thursday evening you could do a cruise (instead of Friday). There\\'s a newish Staten Island ferry from midtown at 39 st. on the west side. It gives views of the Statue of Liberty and stops at Battery Park and runs til 9:30.\\nhttps://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/st-george/\\nOR you could use that to get downtown on a Friday morning.\\nOR you could go to the Empire State on Thursday night or the morning of your departure. Bryant Park is easy to do on the morning of your departure as well.\\nI wouldn\\'t walk the Brooklyn Bridge at night. It could be cold. Also, people usually walk from a Brooklyn back to Manhattan so the skyline is in front of you.\\nEdited: 2:51 pm, October 03, 2021 Bryant Park Grill has outdoor seating and is a very pleasant place to have a drink. Food is okay. Prices reflect its location. It\\'s in the park behind NY Public Library near 40th. Check out photos and reviews on GoogleMaps. There are also other places in the park to eat. Near the park is Angelina Paris (on 6th near 40th). I would do the cruise on Saturday afternoon to give yourself a little rest. You are going to see a show on that evening and it would be a shame to fall sleep because you are too tired from walking. This scared me a bit. I could spend the whole morning just wandering around Central Park.\\nTake a walk on the High Line\\nEmpire State Building\\nCentral Park\\nI\\'m assuming you\\'re starting around 8am, so 1 hour for each activity, and the other hour travelling between them. It\\'s a tight schedule\\nWhen I plan NYC, I always say if i do 50% of what is on my list, it has been a successful vacation. I\\'d recommend you take that away and don\\'t get annoyed when you run out of time rushing around, and hope you have a few days to recover when you get back!!!\\nM **I wouldn\\'t walk the Brooklyn Bridge at night. It could be cold. Also, people usually walk from a Brooklyn back to Manhattan so the skyline is in front of you.**\\nI have to disagree with this. I live rather close to the bridge and see just as many people walking to Brooklyn from the city as in the other direction.\\nI walked the bridge with some out of state friends a couple of weeks ago and I cab it into the city and see the people walking almost weekly.\\nEdited: 7:41 am, yesterday Thank you all for all of your suggestions. I do understand that we may no get everything on the list in. There are some things built into to the itinerary that we are willing to cross off if time gets to short. @nywhiz I also thought of doing The Empire State Building or TOTR on Thursday evening. I was just hesitant to book the reservations not knowing if our flight will be on time, how long it will take to get to the hotel from the airport and such. We are currently scheduled to land at LaGuardia at 4pm. If we could shuffle a few things around to do something Thursday and then something on Monday before we fly out at 3pm that would be awesome. I know we won\\'t get to spend near enough time at the Met or exploring Central Park and just doing all the things at each site. But with it being our first time in the city we want to see and do all we can cram into 4ish days.\\nOh and food we don\\'t want to spend a fortune on food. We do know things will cost more in the city. I want a good slice of NY Pizza, I want to try a real Jewish Deli and get an authentic NY bagel. I would love to try some good ramen, and of course all the sweet stuff. I would say we lean more to casual dining and my friend is not adventurous with food at all. She is very much a hamburger and fries southern girl. American Museum of Natural History is a great place to visit. I\\'ve got a 3 1/2 day itinerary we did this summer that hit most of those spots.\\nI\\'ll be happy to email it to you! My son (18) are coming to NYC over New Years weekend (30th-2nd) as part of his grad trip. We are staying off of 6th Ave and 44th street. We are trying to decide what to do for NYE. I’ve been trying to find info on the ball drop and I’m not finding much. I know last year it was closed to the public. I don’t think we are interested in standing there for 12 hours packed in like sardines even if they are having it. Does anyone know about any of the parties? I saw tickets for a restaurant called the corner at 41st st. It had mixed reviews. Any recommendations for a way to celebrate with someone under 21 and without spending an insane fortune. We have eaten at the R lounge before and agreed that would be the place to be but tickets in the thousands are way out of the question! It is unclear what the festivities will be like this year https://www.timessquarenyc.org/times-square-new-years-eve\\nWhere have you been looking for party venues? (Some offers are dodgy, few offer direct views of the ball drop) Those parties with views cost hundreds of dollars/person to attend. Not sure they let under 21 in.\\nYour hotel is in the Restricted Zone, so expect complications coming and going from it from noon until after midnight on the 31st. We are going to New York the week before Xmas with 15 and 17 year old daughters. They will both be single vaccinated as per British policy for teenagers. Does anyone know if this will be accepted for the Key To New York scheme for hospitality venues please, given that it is Pfizer which is not a ‘single dose vaccine’? Thanks \"As of August 17, people 12 and older are required to show proof they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use by the FDA or WHO\"\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page\\nAnother thing to pay attention to is the (not yet public) Federal rules for admitting foreign leisure travelers. It has been reported travelers will need to be \"fully vaccinated\" but it is unclear what consideration might be given to travelers from places using different dosing schedules As Kay says, it may work for getting them in to NYC hospitality venues, but it may not work for getting them into US. Also keep in mind that though the city rule requires only one shot to get into certain TYPES of venues, some places have policies in place requiring full vaccination, which in the case of vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna, means two shots. Some places may accept very recent testing as an alternative (as some do for children under 12); some may simply refuse anyone who isn\\'t fully vaccinated; it\\'s up to the owner of the business.\\nIn addition, it wasn\\'t clear to me if you understood the city pass isn\\'t offering any special goodies; it\\'s just a way of making sure people going to certain types of mostly indoor events have been at least partially vaccinated. They PRESENT it as if it offers all sorts of terrific things, and maybe some people see it that way, but this is apparently just how they decided to sell vaccination to particularly \"resistant\" people. Some of the TV ads are hysterical.\\nEdited: 3:00 pm, yesterday We’re in exactly the same position as you Fran. My 12 year old will have had one shot only and New York is my daughter’s dream holiday!\\nIt seems odd as The U.K. done so well with their vaccine campaign and the booster programme is going well also as I know lots of people who’ve now had their boosters also yet they seem very reluctant to fully vaccinate kids leaving us behind all other countries.\\nIf The States require kids to be fully vaccinated before a flight that will ruffle a few feathers as NYC aside how many Brits go to Orlando each year….\\nI appreciate medical professionals aren’t thinking about our holidays but I am!!!\\nWe’ve said we’d be prepared to travel if she’s allowed on the flight and inside the hotel as we’re used to doing PCRs etc and we are very careful. If we can get into some places then great but it all hinges on what federal rules are decided.\\n🤞we get to go. Will have to wait for the rules to be released, but I suspect if they say the requirement is teens be fully vaccinated and if the teens who live in the US are required to have two shots to be considered fully vaccinated then I wouldn\\'t expect them to be making an exception for teenagers just because they are coming from the UK with one dose. I\\'m wondering if those of you from places with different (slower) schedules for the second dose shouldn\\'t be inquiring with your health authorities and government representatives about obtaining the second dose earlier\\nPerhaps by showing proof of planned international travel? Some political public pressure might be a good idea.\\nIt\\'s not just about being permitted to travel (or doing indoor activities in places like NYC).\\nIt\\'s about having physical protection from the virus. (It\\'s my understanding that the second doses and currently discussed boosters significantly increase your protection.)\\nA breakthrough infection could be unpleasant, vacation ruining & possibly costly if medical attention or isolation is needed\\nWhile NYC is probably currently a reasonably good travel destination because of it\\'s mitigation rules, relatively high vaccination rates and local attitudes about stopping the spread - other places in the US are not necessarily (There aren\\'t, and probably won\\'t be, any vaccination requirements for domestic travel.) No unfortunately it’s not a case of trying to hurry it up. The U.K. isn’t slow on vaccine rollout quite the contrary.\\nOur booster programme is well under way and my husband is only 41 but already had his third Pfizer booster but kids in The U.K. are only getting one vaccine for the time being, there’s currently no plans to give a second.\\nOur medical ‘professionals’ said the side effects/risks of the vaccine to young patients can be greater than the side effects of Covid for those under 18. They’re only giving them one dose to prevent the spread. I’m not sure I agree but hey ho I don’t get a say.\\nI totally agree if youngsters in NYC or The States have to be fully vaccinated then so should other kids from elsewhere, I wouldn’t expect otherwise. I was lucky enough to get tickets to an upcoming taping of Saturday Night Live! So excited. I was looking for a hotel recommendation that is fairly near to 30 Rock. Thanks! Dates? How many people and beds? What budget per night in USD? We stayed at Hotel48 Lex and it was an easy walk to Rockefeller Center. Plenty of other hotels around too. I prefer small hotels. But, just pull up google maps and start searching by hotels nearby to Rockefeller Center. It\\'s one of my favorite areas. I\\'m a sucker for the architecture. Top of the Rock is one of my favorite activities. The NBC Studio Tour was super too. Dates and budget matter. Also \"close\" is difficult to define. There are hotels a 3 minute walk and there are many many more a 15 minute walk away https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1913413-Reviews-The_Jewel_a_Club_Quarters_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThe Jewel is close within 5 minutes. But does it fit your budget?\\nI agree with Wren, put in 30 Rockefeller Plaza into Google, use the “search nearby “ for hotels and then see which ones fit your budget, taste and dates. It\\'s for 3 of us so some place with 2 double beds. Looking in the $200-300 per night range. 15 mins walk is fine. I can search with Google maps. I was just wondering if anyone had one that they recommended. Thanks to all for responding. It is much appreciated. What are your dates, they really matter when booking nyc hotels. The price can vary massively I did like the one I mentioned above. It does have a nightly \"amenity\" fee (or whatever they call it) so I\\'m not sure it\\'ll be in your budget. It does include breakfast (cold but good) and wine (between 5-6, maybe weekdays only...not positive). We made the walk to RC lots of times from there. I felt like one of the blocks was a bit lonely due to being office buildings (aka not busy in the evenings) so keeo that in mind if leaving SNL late at night. You can always try and get a taxi or ride share too. My family and I have stayed several times at the Sheraton Times Square on 7th Avenue and 53rd. I don’t know the cost because I use Marriott Bonvoy points - besides you did not state a budget. It is 5 to 10 minutes walking to Rockefeller Center. Agree with other posts re: vague dates. Note that the 2021 NYC Marathon is Sun, November 7, and midtown hotels are quickly booked up for that weekend. Hotel rates fluctuate by date. All the places mentioned are near enough. Depending on your dates, you may struggle to find a room for 3 for $300. Taxes will add 15% and many hotels charge a resort fee on top. The Jewel is closest to Rock Center (literally across the street). There are some hotels that have 2 queen beds vs the more typical 2 doubles. Hilton garden Inn Times Square and Hampton inn times Square NORTH are 2 with large rooms and 2 queen beds.\\nRadio City Apartments is a budget option nearby. Decor very dated but rooms are like Apts. With kitchens. They also have some 2 queen rooms.\\nEdited: 10:23 am, today Hi TA,\\nI used to live in the city and have gotten a strong urge to visit esp with the 20 yr anniversary of 911.

And you shouldn\\'t plan a Broadway show your first night, especially with such a late arrival. Even if your flight is on time, you get your luggage immediately and you will still be rushing to get to your hotel during rush hour, check in, freshen up, eat dinner and get to the theater. And if you\\'ve had a long flight and/or early start, you may struggle to stay awake in a dark theater. If you want another Broadway show, you should see Come From Away. Jeff Daniels was truly incredible in TKAM. A real tour de force.\\nI checked - Chicago starts at 8. Where are you coming in from? Are you checking luggage? Which airport? What day of the week (Friday traffic in both directions is worse than any other day of the way)? Are you flying? If so, I would check on-time history of your flight, is there a flight change involved? When is the trip - could there by weather issues? If not coming from too far, and there are regular flights, landing at 5 at LGA would be a risk I would take...at Newark or JFK, I would consider all of the other factors. Day 2 (the first Day 2) - there is a risk that you may have to wait in line for the One World Observatory. I do not think it is worth it. I would spend your entire morning at the 9/11 Museum.\\nDay 2 (the second Day 2) - Doing BOTH the One World Observatory and the Empire State Building is overkill in my opinion.\\nDay 2 (the second Day 2) - I think you could spend the entire afternoon in the Metropolitan Museum - 4-5 hours. Go to Central Park and Fifth Avenue during the morning of your last day before going home.\\nDay 3 - Why so many rides up to the top in your trip plan? It is expensive and you may have to wait in line.\\nIn general I think you have too much in your plan. I have lived in or near New York my entire life. It is my opinion. Good luck and have a nice trip. Thanks everyone for your reply.\\nWe are taking a direct flight from cali. Arrive Oct 17 - sunday JFK 345 pm. Yes i will skip the broadway show that day.\\nSo if I had one choice between Top of the Rock or Empire state , which one would it be? I truly cant remember which one ivebeen to. I think its Empire state.\\nOurreturn flight is 445pm on Thursday.\\nALso, is the NYC pass worthi it? Irs $136 per person.\\nEm\\nSan diego, Ca I would personally say ToTR because of its views of the ESB and Central Park etc.\\nLooking at what you have planned that you can realistically do, I don’t think the pass is worth it personally - way to work it out is to look at the admission of places that are included that you plan to go to and compare to the pass but look closely at the terms of admission on the pass - some have things like “Must be booked on the day” etc I also agree with less observation decks and more checking out the neighborhoods that make up the heart and soul of the city! I recommend visiting the American Museum of Natural History. It’s a great museum. In a year of the pandemic, this years list is out and a couple of NYC restaurants made the Top 100:\\nhttps://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50\\nhttps://www.theworlds50best.com/list/51-100\\nNo. 22 - Cosme - the highest rated in NYC\\nNo. 43 - Atomix\\nNo. 44 - Le Bernardin\\nNo. 55 - Chef\\'s Table at Brooklyn Fare Grr.. i will pay more attention next year because :\\nThe anonymous voting body is comprised almost equally by chefs and restaurateurs, food writers and “well-traveled gourmets,” according to the World’s 50 Best site. Each confidentially proposes 10 restaurants that they are required to have visited at least once in the past 18 months. (In New York City, mandatory citywide restaurant shutdowns began 19 months ago.)\\nIn an effort to mitigate travel restrictions and other pandemic-related dining and ranking roadblocks, this year’s list took into account selections submitted in January of 2020, before that year’s winners were determined, followed by what organizers call a “voting refresh” conducted this past March. Previous number one restaurants, like Eleven Madison Park, are ineligible.\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/the-worlds-50-best-restaurants-were-just-announcedthese-are-the-nyc-picks-100521 Maybe it\\'s me, but these \"best of\" lists are useless. I agree with you ISDW. Some people must have been travelling extensively all year, how? Yay - I found *one* spot in the Top 100 I’ve been to. (Not in NYC.) I want to go to Cosme. Their corn husk meringue dessert has been on my list for years.\\nhttps://www.eater.com/video/2017/7/27/16038030/cosme-corn-husk-meringue-dessert Its my annual reminder that Cosme still exists It still exists and is doing well. And they still have the same dessert! FYI Daniela Soto-Innes, the brain behind Cosme\\'s menu left last December Hi all, just want peoples opinion on this matter. I’m looking to visit New York from November 27th to December 4th. The US have announced they will be opening the borders again ‘early’ November. I’m struggling with the decision as to whether to book a flight yet or not. What are other peoples thoughts? Anyone else in this situation? Anyone gone ahead and booked? Details have not been made public\\nI would not book anything that is not fully refundable *upon your request* - not at the option of the vendor to offer refunds / rescheduling / vouchers Are you the betting type?\\nI\\'m sure there are many travellers and tourists whose urge to travel is so strong, they\\'ve already booked flights to the USA from any country currently on the banned list, and non cancellable tickets at that. That\\'s their prerogative, of course. Some may have vouchers from previously cancelled trips with a deadline, and they too may have rescheduled for a travel date for November.\\nHowever, nobody knows and can only guess when the actual date that travel will be allowed for those, including Brits, not currently able to do so for leisure reasons. But, don\\'t forget, that\\'s not the only hurdle you may face. Most Brits - certainly the vast majority over 40, got the OAZ vaccine. That is currently not recognised by the USA and that\\'s one of those areas on which politician both sides of the Pond have been noticeably silent about. So, if you are fully vaccinated but got the OAZ one, don\\'t count your chickens.\\nFurther, nobody yet knows what the proof of vaccination that will be acceptable by the USA will look like, given the different countries affected have their own local ways or recording this.\\nSWT \".....the OAZ vaccine. That is currently not recognised by the USA....\"\\nThat\\'s just not true SWT. The OAZ vaccine is recognised by the WHO, so is recognised for entry to the US by the US Government. The FDA hasn\\'t authorised it for use within the US. A completely different thing. Please don\\'t spread negative falsehoods. Note that some venues in NYC that require proof of vax, like theaters, are also taking WHO-approved vaccines, and some list them. The list I saw included Astra Zeneca plus a couple vaccines that I believe are same as AZ, but produced somewhere where they have different names, like Covishield. Also on the list were a couple Chinese vaccines, including Sinovac. Also, I think people from the countries with the largest number of tourists to NYC will likely not have huge problems getting their proof recognized as that will get sorted out quickly due to the sheer number of them. Think UK, Ireland, Brazil, China. I think it\\'s visitors from places with fewer visitors where it may take more time for \"proof checkers\" to verify.\\nI believe the EU has a standardized digital pass for its members, but doubt that could be scanned/read here, so people from EU countries may need to have paper proof from their national health authority. #3, you should practice what you preach. As of a few days ago the AZ was not approved for entry to the US from the UK. In fact nothing was because they are still deciding what will be accepted.\\nIf they have announced what is approved for entry since what I read a few days ago I will stand corrected and agree you are right. But as of the most recent information I know of you are not confirmed correct, or incorrect, it\\'s not known yet to the best of my knowledge.\\nEdited: 4:18 pm, October 02, 2021 I think a lot of people do not understand that as far as the US \"not recognizing\" AstraZenica, the issue is that AstraZenica has not even applied for FDA approval in the US. They totally mucked up their data in the US and cannot get it together to submit an application. They have talked about this for months about how they are finally going to get it together to apply properly, but they have not to date. I read one article that says the hope to seek FDA approval (for use in vaccination in the US) sometime this Autumn. If I recall, either European countries do not have as rigorous approval processes or they didn\\'t mess up their application and data to get UK approval, like they did in the US. This is AstraZenica\\'s decision, they decided to wait to seek full FDA approval, not the fast-track emergency use which other vaccines originally got (and that they mucked up). The full approval requires more data and takes longer. They probably figured at tyhis point, they weren\\'t going to sell a lot under emergency approval given there is enough supply i the US of other vaccines.\\nThe CDC decides which vaccines wiil qualify when they finally announce the rules, but they have stated they intend to authorize any COVID vaccine authorized by the FDA or the WHO to be considered \"fully vaccinated\". So I wouldn\\'t worry about that point. Indeed Dr Anthony Fauci has \"suggested\" that U.K. citizens vaccinated with the AstraZeneca jab will be allowed into the United States.\\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/09/21/britons-astrazeneca-vaccine-will-allowed-us-suggests-anthony/\\nIt would be illogical for the United States to reopen it\\'s borders, and then deny entry to a large proportion of U.K., European and Canadian citizens.\\nI would go ahead and book a flight, but make sure it can be refunded or altered without penalty, just in case something unexpected happens.\\nEdited: 10:01 pm, October 02, 2021 When has \\'logic\\' been a reliable benchmark when dealing with politics? I would arrange for your ESTA and hold off until the official announcement before booking flights/hotel. With gentrification and the constant change of various neighborhoods, I can imagine that a lot of old-school graffiti on trains and buildings has long since been done away with. I would like to take some photos that show this homage to the 70s and 80s via street art and graffiti in all of its forms. Yes, some graffiti is just horrible, and other graffiti is a true work of art. It all depends and is subjective to each person\\'s artistic preferences.\\nI found a subway station that has a super long entrance walkway that is just covered in layers and layers of graffiti. I might try to visit it when I am in NYC.\\nAre there any areas/neighborhoods that you know of that have a lot of graffiti or murals that would be great to photograph? Welling Court Mural Project. It is in Astoria, near the Astoria Landing Ferry Landing, the Socrates Sculpture Park, and the Noguchi Museum.\\nhttps://www.wellingcourtmuralprojectnyc.com/ The proper name for this is called Vandalism -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

Some people think he’s a vandal, others think he’s an artist. The Bushwick Collective and the Welling Court Murals are both great but the Bushwick Collective is much bigger.

Most of it is very recent and definitely not from the 70s and 80s though.\\nThe East Village also has a few and easier to access from within Manhattan.\\nhttps://www.villagepreservation.org/2020/01/28/east-village-street-art-lives-on/\\nhttps://www.runstreet.com/blog/manhattan-street-art\\nAnd the Lower East Side (and other areas) has a very cool 100 Gates Project, where the roll down store shutters and gates are painted by different artists. This should be seen before the shutters come up for the day or after the stores are closed at night obviously. Some are very cool.\\nhttp://100gates.nyc/about/ I\\'m sorry, but this question seems like a contradiction to me. Are you looking for old school NYC graffiti...or an area with \"homages\"?\\nThe Bushwick Collective is NOT old school NYC graffiti. While that area is cool for looking at art/graffiti these days...and the men and women who produce those pieces are very good(I\\'m an old school graffiti dude who knows many of them), that\\'s \"gentrified\" graffiti.\\nIf you are looking for old school graffiti, there are several areas in the city where it can still be found.\\nBanksy is definitely not old school NYC graffiti. Not even close! Agree w Ter - there’s a difference between “street art” (which is what you’ll see in Bushwick and Welling Court) and old-school graffiti.\\nI think that if you keep your eyes open in less-prettified/gentrified sections of the city you’ll see old school graffiti - elaborate tags, etc. - but I can’t think of any particular areas to suggest. Maybe the East Village? It’s pretty gentrified, to be sure, but it still has a lot of the old stuff (as well as new artsy stuff). Although it\\'s very modern, the Kelsey Montague mural in NoLiTa is very pretty and great for a photograph or selfie.\\nhttps://kelseymontagueart.com/interactive-map/\\nAnd more very pretty ones in SoHo, NoLiTa and Chinatown. The article also mentions the 100 Gates Project : https://carriecolbert.com/guide-nycs-best-murals-soho-nolita-chinatown-2/ Agree with Linda and Ter, there is no graffiti on trains, that is illegal. Sometimes there are things scribbled on the entrance to subway stations, removed very quickly, but I took a photo of a brilliantly lewd one a few months ago that I caught before it was removed (so, keep your eyes open when walking around- you never know when and where you\\'ll catch sight of something).\\nAs far as street art: There is always something interesting in the playground around Hudson and Houston-Clarkson streets. I always notice it because it\\'s close to one of my favorite restaurants and I was there last night. Huge scale public art. There\\'s still plenty of street art in SoHo that sprouted up during the pandemic. I never escape from that neighborhood without adding to the photo roll on my cellphone.\\nI was a little underwhelmed by the much touted mural on Doyers St, but you may like it, read up on it first. There\\'s also some vertical artwork on the street. I like taking that minor detour anyhow, when in that neighborhood. https://secretnyc.co/doyers-street-mural/ Hi heading to NY this December for just a week, what currently is the best sim to buy to use in our Irish phones dáta and voice, thanks? Last time I was there I used a Pay As You Go (PAYG) AT&T SIM card. I\\'m not sure if it was the most \"bang for your buck\" but it worked. Was there about a week. If you want to buy something before you go try king sims\\nOtherwise get a local one as above I normally get a sim from Best Buy using Simple Mobile. I think it’s $50 but includes unlimited calls, texts and data I keep topping up my t-mobile SIM, and use the same sim and number that I\\'ve had for the past 15 years.\\nIt\\'s $3 a month to keep it alive when I\\'m not visiting (oh ok, I\\'ve not visited in a few years), and when I visit, I top up $50 and that gives me unlimited everything at 4G speeds..\\nSaves me having to think about anything, might not be the cheapest for a tourist, but I don\\'t have to search around. We will be visiting New York the week end before Christmas. Arriving on Friday and Depart on Monday. We have tickets to see the Rockettes on Saturday at 5 (A life long dream of my 47 year old daughter) and also plan on the 911 museum on Sunday. Does any one have any suggestions for Dinner on Friday, Saturday or Sunday or other interesting things to see. We are staying 3 blocks from Radio City Music Hall. There\\'s a lot you could see, from big Christmas trees to ice skating to Holiday Markets to store decorations.\\nHave a read of this information thread that lists many things from last year, things could be different this year, but you will only have time to choose a few things. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13419686-Christmastime_in_NYC_2020_What_s_On_Dates_Updates-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThere are also the usual famous sights like the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge etc that are in the same general area as the 9/11 Memorial and Museum that you might be able to fit in if those interest you .\\nAs for eating, there are thousands of places to eat. Lunch can be near wherever you\\'re sightseeing at the time. Dinner can be near the hotel (where are you staying?) or somewhere before the Rockettes. For dining recommendations we need a budget/entrée & food likes & dislikes. Dinner in the $$$ or $$$$ range. Can you define that in numbers? Also you didn\\'t give us likes & dislikes. It wouldn\\'t do any good for us to recommend something you don\\'t like or can\\'t ear. We eat most anything. Entrees between $20-$30. Our Hotel is near Rockefeller Center.\\nr **Can you define that in numbers?**\\nThat made me laugh. **Dinner in the $$$ or $$$$ range.**\\nJust so you know, when in NYC, ^ is probably referring to $100 + range.\\nEdited: 7:46 am, yesterday agreed $20-$30 is $$ at most in NYC.\\nAt least the reply wasn\\'t \"you know, something moderate\"\\nEdited: 8:31 am, yesterday I really do not appreciate the sarcasm. Just wanted ideas for dinner. I am assuming total cost will be about $100 or so per person. Who has good veal picatta in Manhattan? We are staying mid-town and are not looking for an expensive dress up place. TIA I think someone asked the same question within just the past month or so. Try doing a search in the New York City Forum. Thank you, Grandrue; I found it. I’m seeing Il Cortile, Forlini’s, Tony Di Napoli - Midtown, and Pietro’s, but I don’t recall any comments about whether the veal was good (i.e., tough rather than tender). I also couldn’t tell if these are restaurants that welcome casually dressed diners. Tony Di Napoli\\'s is casual although I wasn\\'t very impressed when I have eaten there in the past. Didn\\'t have the veal though. First, am not sure I understand what you mean by not getting dressed up. I would not suggest shorts and a tank top at any of them (though in an article on Forlini\\'s I saw a guy in a tank top and tattooes, but with slacks). If it\\'s a suit and tie you want to avoid, and I have not been to all of these places recently, I think you should be okay with \"smart casual\" (like slacks and a shirt with sleeves) at most of them, with the possible exception of Pietro\\'s, but am not really sure on that. If a place has some sort of attire rule, it should be on their website.\\nIf I were you I would try to find reviews for these restaurants -- try sites like eater, yelp, opentable, etc. I thought, in connection with that other post, whether here or in an online review, I read someone complaining about the lack of tenderness of the veal. I have an 11 year old and we are planning on seeing a Broadway show in November. I see that we need to have either a pcr test 72 hours prior or rapid test 6 hours before the show.\\nWe are not in the area so I am afraid we will not get the results in time so we might have to do a rapid test when we arrive.\\nIs there a place around Times Square we can do this? Why not CVS or some place like that in Binghamton before you leave?\\nIn my state they are still giving free tests to residents of the state and turn-around is rarely over 36 hours. Is there anything like that near you?\\nI would not want to be running around the city looking for a rapid test just before the show.\\nGood luck? They are in the process of approving vaccinations for younger children. I\\'d check with the local health department to see if that\\'s an option. Can\\'t you just get those over the counter rapid antigen tests at CVS or Walgreens- such as the Binax tests? These are easy and your kid can take one within 6 hours of going to the show. #3 - you can use an OTC test, but the results have to show date and time. I’ve yet to find one that does that. Look for the nearest LabQ Diagnostics mobile van - they test for free.\\nhttps://labq.com/covid-mobile-testing/ yes, there is a van near TImes Square that does that. It\\'s at Broadway Plaza.\\nhttps://www.timessquarenyc.org/whats-happening/cts-mobile-covid-testing-van Any idea what the cost for a test for international tourists? Thank you for the info. Does anyone know if the testing site in Times Square is a PCR test? We received an email regarding The Rockettes show that we are scheduled to see. The email from the Madison Square Garden advised that children 12 and under do NOT need a negative test. They need to be accompanied by a vaccinated adult and wear a mask except when eating and drinking. I think it may depend on the venue. We received a similar email to OP regarding a Broadway show we\\'re seeing in November with our two 11yos. Coming from out of state and the timing is just wrong enough that we\\'ll need to test them once we arrive in NYC, not sooner. Hoping that mobile one is still hanging out as we also have yet to find a rapid OTC test that provides a date/time. I\\'m planning on bringing my 11 & 14 year old sons to New York for a weekend in November, taking the train up from PA. We already have a show and a trip to the Statue of Liberty planned (different days) so want to fill in around that with other small things. Both kids enjoy trains, and would love to see train related places. New York Transit Museum\\nGrand Central Terminus\\nEdited: 2:49 pm, yesterday Buy subway passes so you can ride as much as you\\'d like without worrying about adding up the fares.\\nAnd while they might love trains, try the tram to Roosevelt Island. That\\'s a pretty neat experience. NYC Transit Museum\\nAlso the End of the High Line you get a great view of the Long Island Railroad Yard\\nAlso go to Queens Plaza in Long Island City and Walk a little down Queens Blvd, you will cross over the Sunnyside yard which is a major yard for Amtrak and NJ transit Take the PATH train or ferry over to Hoboken and walk around Hoboken Terminal. NJ Transit trains and the light rail at the far south end. If you walk south past the light rail onto the Hudson River Walkway there\\'s a park called Newport Green not far along with a sandy \"beach\" and a carousel. They may be too old for this but the New York Botanical Garden Holiday Train Show begins Nov 20. Boarding the Metro North train at Grand Central Terminal is always a thrill for this train buff. The trip itself to the Garden is nice crossing the Harlem River. Take Path Train to NJ and then Hudson Bergan Light Rail to Libery State park\\nYou need to walk into the Park to the Statue of Liberty Ticket office, , That building is an Abandoned Rail Terminal for the jersey Central\\nSomeone made a video about it (Not me)\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo1NQLCsafs&ab_channel=RayOutThere\\nThey still have signs over the abandoned platforms of trains long gone The Transit Museum in Downtown Brooklyn sounds like the best option, already mentioned by others. It\\'s a museum in an old subway station, is underground with many old subway cars from eras gone by plus all sorts of hands-on exhibits for trains and buses. Train enthusiasts would love it.\\nOnly open Fri-Sun from 11.00am to 4.00pm. https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/knowbeforeyouvisit/\\nThere is also an annex of that museum in Grand Central Terminal. Wed-Fri from 11.00am to 6.00pm. Located just off the Main Concourse in the Shuttle Passage, adjacent to the Station Masters’ Office.\\nAnd even though you won\\'t see any trains, the High Line is an old above ground train line that has been turned into a 1.45 miles (2.3km) stretch of park. It\\'s very nice. Train tracks have been left in places so your boys might like knowing the history of it and walking and trying to spot the old train tracks.\\nhttps://www.thehighline.org/photos/at-a-glance/best-of/ Another option is to do a tour of subway art. There are a few options. I did the one with Darryl and it was great. A few hours on the subway looking at the art on one entry fee...so well organised.\\nhttp://nycsubwaytour.com/\\n+ a squillion for the Transit Museum and Grand Central Terminal. I don\\'t know if the Transit Museum branch in Grand Central, which is really more of a souvenir shop, has reopened, but it has had, at Christmas, an incredible model train setup. There is a story behind this one, it may be privately owned, but I can\\'t remember it, but it is definitely worth seeing if it is still there -- I personally find it more interesting than that thing at the botanical garden. Wander around Grand Central, maybe take a look at the tracks, which are easy to see/get to from main concourse. I\\'m not sure, but I believe they may have resumed tours of GCT, and that is something your boys might enjoy. I also suggest you try to get to the real Transit Museum in Brooklyn.\\nI believe the NY Historical Society has a noteworthy collection of antique toy trains that are sometimes exhibited around Christmas. One more suggestion take the Subway to Rockaway, the ride from Howard Beach to Broad Channel to Rockaway is the best Subway Ride there is, It goes over Jamaica Bay and you get some nice views.\\nAlso Take the train over the Manhattan Bridge and/or Williamsburg Bridge, Also a pretty cool ride I note this hotel is still currently closed but is continuing to take future bookings.\\nI have a booking here over Christmas ( restrictions depending) and note prices for NYC are rising sharply.\\nI’m deliberating on whether it’s worth switching to another hotel sooner rather than later before prices go sky\\nhigh . Would anybody have any idea if/when it’s due to open? I’ve tried contacting the hotel to no avail.\\nWould anybody have any recommendations for a similar hotel around the same area?\\nThank you… The Warwick across the road. The Hilton Midtown is the largest hotel in NYC with over 2k rooms. I believe Rockefeller Center used to be in their name at one point. The location is not bad. Their website shows \"sold out\" until October 4/5 which I assume is the reopening. What is termed the \"average price\" is indicated and it goes up and down like the stock market.\\nhttps://www.hilton.com/en/book/reservation/flexibledates/?ctyhocn=NYCNHHH&arrivalDate=2021-09-26&departureDate=2021-09-27&room1NumAdults=1&displayCurrency=LOCAL&inputModule=hotel&WT.mc_id=zlada0ww1hi2psh3ggl4advbpp5dkt6multibr7_153669424_1003528_CPAvROAS_CPA&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMCKBhDAARIsAG-2Eu_-AV458STbecAmbpBYHSfujB5tgnk1Y4OJdQP4kP2rfnzCnjuTAi4aAmVwEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds I would book a Plan B that is refundable, but if the Hilton is your first choice, no need to cancel it until much later. I agree you should have a backup and think the Warwick would be a good alternative if open and the price is right.\\nNote the Hilton has been closed for a very long time, is a huge place, and I imagine getting things back to \"normal\" may take a while. If I were you, I would carefully monitor reviews from people who stay there in Oct and Nov. If they are not good, you might want to think of going to your backup. The Warwick right across the street from the Hilton is great! Small, boutique and fantastic corner bar! We stay at Hilton because we are owners there, but if we weren\\'t, we would definitely stay back at the Warwick. We own there and have been told Oct 4. We have reserved a unit for later in October. We booked for a stay 9-27-30 about a week ago my mom got a notice her reservation was cancelled so we called and ours was cancelled also. Thank goodness she received the notice or we would have just down up luggage in tow. We made new reservations at the Knickerbocker where we had stayed before Thank you for your responses.\\nI’m booked with BA as a package and got a very good deal but I suspect I’ll end up paying out more.\\nI’ve never been particularly keen on the look of The Hilton Midtown but the location swayed us as we’re travelling with a 12 year old who wants to see all of the sights.\\nWe almost booked Intercon Barclay but I’d read the immediate area was a tad depressing due to a lot of closures around.\\nI’ll have a look at the recommendations but think I’ll hang on a few more weeks and If it doesn’t open early Oct as planned I’ll look to switch.\\nThanks again. We’ve got a BA package deal too for late November at the Hilton midtown, I didn’t realise it was currently closed til I saw this thread, slightly concerned but fingers crossed they do open in October. I don’t fancy being on hold to BA for hours! Where would you go. At 70 I am sure it is my last 2 nights in Manhattan. Been a great trip. Had 5 star pizza, guacamole, and veal.\\nEverything else was good but not quite 5. What kind of budget are you looking at? Also, any particular neighbourhood?\\nEdited: 2:22 pm, yesterday And food preferences - likes / dislikes? I could probably name a few fish and seafood places that I love, but if you don\\'t ... Manhattan price not and issue but not crazy. Just one of your final two. Manhattan is quite a big place. Any particular part? And what does “not crazy” mean. Come on, give us something to work with South of 96st. Still have not found great Mexican. Kyma, if you like fish. (Greek restaurant.). The bar at Gramercy Tavern (great menu. You can get a table in the bar). Nur is a favorite. There’s always Balthazar (I stopped in 2 nights ago and had the trout and frites). If you provide a neighborhood or cuisine type, that would help For GREAT Mexican, you want Cosme.\\nFor very good, one of the Empellon restaurants. https://www.empellon.com/ Indonesia would be good. A couple of us on this board with vastly different flavor profiles all like Wayan (French Indonesian) https://www.wayan-nyc.com/\\nAn old time favorite is Indochine. https://www.indochinenyc.com/ I know this has been asked before in some form, but we’ve just booked a 2022 visit to NY from the 1st-5th of September. I was wondering if any major attractions/activities are closed for the weekend or Monday and should be done early?\\nAny advice would be appreciated.\\nWe don’t intend to do much shopping, but we’ll take a look at Macy’s, apple store and a few on the way up/down 5th Avenue as we explore the city a little more this time around. The major attractions are all open on Labor Day. I would treat the entire wknd as a holiday wknd....including Monday. I know I always do! Unless you are a union member & are taking part in their activities (any union) basically Labor Day is a free day off for most of us. The only thing you might need to be aware of is that this is considered the last day of the summer season so, if the weather is at all warm, any beaches you might go to would be packed. Labor Day wknd is a great time to visit the city....especially if the weather cooperates. Don\\'t worry about having things to do.

I have a hotel booked at Hotel Edison. Dinner reservations one night at Carmines other than just sight seeing and possibly a show not sure what else we should do. Are there any interactive dinner/shows or comedy like shows that are appropriate? Kind of looking for an “Experience” like dinner - lots of laughs and memories to be made. Any suggestions of the out of the ordinary touristy destinations are greatly appreciated!!

Museum of the Moving Image http://www.movingimage.us/\\nWhat do you have in mind for the special meal? Something that makes them feel grown up? A view? A novelty / theme place? Also, normally I try not to get hung up too much in budget. But Carmine’s is notably less expensive than many other places I might recommend. So please note if you have a cap on budget. Something like Casa LaFemme, which has belly dancing performances on weekends, would run closer to $55pp (although you can order a la crate for less) without alcohol (for adults), tax, and tip. https://www.casalafemmeny.com/\\nWhich also leads to the question: NYC kids are 16 going on 35. Are these kids sophisticated, ready for grown up type entertainment or are they still entertained by more kid stuff? For the film lover, how about visiting the Museum of moving images in Queens? Their permanent Jim Henson exhibit is great. We will be there Nov 12-13th Oh WOW had no clue that existed!! Thank you!! They are very mature for 16… I will look into that recommendation- thank you!! Unclear when they\\'ll reopen but also look at https://www.paleycenter.org/visit/ I am going to be staying solo for a month in Manhattan and I am trying to figure out where. I am a 23 year old female. I like to walk a lot but I tend to feel unsafe at night when alone.\\nI know almost nothing about the safest places in Manhattan, but I was viewing apartments on Hells Kitchen and the lower side of the city (dont really know all the neighbourhood names), but today it occured to me that the upper side might be cheaper and quieter.\\nThe other thing is: I save money in accomodation but spend it on transportation that way?\\nWhat would you guys recommend? Depends on where you will be spending most of your time. If you have some sort of job or something you will be commuting to I would start by looking at neighborhoods with easy access to that location. Upper east and west sides are likely to be cheaper given they are heavy residential areas with more apartments, amenities and there are people walking the streets pretty late. I wouldn\\'t stay in areas that are mainly commercial because they can become more desolate as the night goes on. You can look at some neighborhoods downtown but you will likely be paying more. Hell\\'s kitchen for the most part is fine but it really depends on where in hell\\'s kitchen. The southern portion can get sketchy and the far west portions aren\\'t really ideal if you want easy access to transit. You don\\'t want to have long walks to and from the subway if you will be using transit as that would get old really fast. If you are looking at Airbnb type accommodation, it is generally illegal in NYC, EXCEPT for stays of \"over 1 month\". So if you are looking at 32 days you are safer, but there are still lots of scams and other reasons why an apartment rental might be illegal.\\nUnder 30 days isn\\'t going to be legal in general. Even for 30+ days the tenant or condo/coop owner may not have the legal right to sublet without landlord or board approval Even for +30 days if the Airbnb owner is habitually renting to others for less than 30 days they could be shut down just before or during your stay.\\nBe careful or you could find yourself in NYC with no place to stay. It won’t be cheap but it is probably safest to look for some sort of corporate housing. There is no best location unless you’re here for a job or class a d want to be nearby. What is your budget? What are you coming to do? >Even for +30 days if the Airbnb owner is habitually renting to others for less than 30 days they could be shut down just before or during your stay.<\\n^An Airbnb host renting an entire apartment are operating illegally IF the building is occupied by three or more families living independently.\\nIf it is occupied by one or two families living independently then its LEGAL .\\nOn Airbnb, (if this is where you are looking,) even though you are planning to rent for over 30 days-\\n——to ensure LEGALITY you must look for a rental in a building occupied by one or two families only ,no more.\\nThis way it will be legal all around ,legal for under 30 days and legal for over 30 days.\\nThese buildings are uncommon in Manhattan. It will be hard work to find a legal one and in my opinion will give you lot of worry and stress that you could be breaking the law.\\nIts hard for a typical person to securely come to know if the rental is a legal one.\\nAnother detail of Airbnb rentals, even if you believe you have secured a legal rental , the host may cancel on you at the last minute. You get your money back, but you are left scrambling for accommodations in budget at the last minute.\\nAlso the cleaning fees for some Airbnbs are exorbitant.\\nMy advice is to stop considering Airbnb rentals in New York City altogether if that’s what you were doing.\\nWhat is your budget for the month? Paula, if you are concerned about safety in Manhattan, which is very safe, you are not going to reveal more about yourself. But you seem to not know the first thing about NYC. (That\\'s okay, if you\\'ve never been, and are just starting your research. But it\\'s an impediment to making decisions.)\\nWe can\\'t know what you are \"doing\" unless you tell us. But it is quite unusual for someone in Manhattan (especially a tourist (?)) to go more than one day without taking a subway or a bus somewhere. It\\'s common for residents to take two to four transit rides EVERY day. It\\'s a BIG city. As noted, your walk to transit can be a big factor in underserved (like 10th or 11th Avenue, or the outlying boroughs) areas.\\nYou should start by studying the neighborhood names so that you can ask understandable questions. It is very hard to understand the subtleties of residential housing in Lower Manhattan versus the Upper West and East Sides. We need to know more about your desires and plans. And, yes, the subject of lawless internet housing startups cannot be avoided. The vacancy rate in NY, even with Covid, is always lower than in other major cities, creating heavy demand for apartments and for ... income. @7 plus 1.\\nPaula, I agree with post 7 Concerning understanding and knowing Manhattan geography.. It was the first thing I thought as well.\\nThis forum Can help.\\nThe more you know about New York City the better.\\nIf it was me , I would check out or buy books on New York City and learn as much as I could.\\nA guidebook Can be gotten from the library ,try to get the latest edition.\\nEdited: 3:21 pm, September 29, 2021 No, you’re right. I dont know much of manhattan. It will be my first time there and my second in the US. Im not travelling for work. Just to get to know the city. And i appreciate the replies explaining the deal with Airbnb. What would you recommend for me to rent there? An hotel its too expensive.\\nMy budget for the accommodations its 3500-4500. I dont know if its too low for a month. What do you think?\\nThank you all for your help! My hope for you is that you could find private room in a decent/safe low cost legal hotel or hostel.\\nWhat are your dates?\\nNY Moore hostel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn has private rooms with private WC/bath\\nThe cost varies by date, right now in October price $149. Plus tax.\\nhttps://nymoorehostel.com/the-hostel/our-story/\\nAdditionally For Manhattan look at :\\nhttps://ymcanyc.org/guest-rooms\\nThe West side YMCA\\nThis place offers ALL private rooms some with WC/bath some with shared WC. Again the price varies by date,\\nRight now the price for the Private WC./bath room is $159 plus tax.\\nThe cost for private room whit a shared WC/bath is lower.\\nEdited: 3:26 pm, yesterday I arrived in New York Tuesday afternoon and love being back, even if it\\'s a short visit. My hotel, Sixty LES, is in the Lower East Side and I buzzed around the neighborhood after checking in. Stopped at a nearby restaurant for Asian take-out (delicious!) and chatted with staff, one of which is from Los Angeles. I grew up in San Francisco and talked about California a few minutes. I buzzed around the neighborhood enjoying street life in the area.\\nOne hazard to this hotel location is that Katz\\'s Deli is one block away, which is dangerous for one\\'s waistline if you like Corned Beef Reubens or Pastrami sandwiches that feed a family of four. I did go in Wednesday late morning to get lunch/dinner as take-out and it was fabulous. Also, want to plug Lowery Coffee Supply on Lowery Street, which makes fabulous coffee drinks.\\nLate Wednesday, I met up with Brooklyn Mel - anyone remember him?? - and joined him and friends on a beautiful sunset bike ride around Red Hook, Brooklyn Park, the piers, etc. Brooklyn is beautiful in the fall and the ride during sunset was great. As night fell, we rode for another couple hours and saw Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, Statue of Liberty, tugboats on the water and the WTC all beautifully lit and colorful. Definitely one of those Kodak moments.\\niPhones stepped in instead. We had a 9:00 PM BBQ dinner and chatted away enjoying the wonderful food and good company. Also, I love how many people are on the subway at night, e.g., going to work, coming home from work or errands. The F line and the R lines were super clean. Great job, MTA!\\nThis weekend, I\\'ll meet an old friend from SF. I hope to reach (rent a bike) in Central Park, if possible, visit the Tenement Museum and the Jewish Museum and get myself back to The Met. The weather is mild, e.g., high 60s-low 70s during the day (this week) and missed the rain. =>\\nIt\\'s great being back in New York, as I so love this city. I spend the days simply, walking here, walking there and taking it in. Quick FYI, was on Broadway yesterday and car horns did not stop honking. Life in the city I love!\\nGlobe Sounds great, especially the sunset bike ride! You solidified my plans to bike the waterfront tonight on the way to dinner. Very nice report. What a nice bike ride.\\nYes, I remember Brooklyn Mel. He was on here when I first started as a newbie and was a very friendly and helpful guy. Hope he\\'s been well. Great report ! Thanks for writing.\\n“….walking here walking there…” sounds So fun.\\nIt’s joyful to read your report enjoying the city! One significant downside of my hotel room is that there is a restaurant and bar below on the street and the noise (people & music) is excessive.\\nGranted, it’s Saturday night and it was a warm, beautiful day today. Makes sense that people are enjoying the weekend. My recommendation would be to reserve a room as high as you can in this hotel. My room is on the 6th floor and it seems like I’m on the ground floor, as I can hear/repeat conversations people are having. >> One significant downside of my hotel room is that there is a restaurant and bar below on the street and the noise (people & music) is excessive.\\nSo now you know what it’s really like to live in New York. ;-) Nice trip. Thanks for your trip report. So true BPNYC. You have to be reaaaalllly high up not to hear the noise (or not face the street).\\nHave a great time! It was a warm, beautiful weekend as long as you\\'re okay with humidity. Personally, I like it. I met a friend at Grand Central Terminal, as he came in from New Haven and we had lunch Saturday. Another beautiful day and we walked around the neighborhood afterwards and caught up. It was wonderful.\\nOne thing I love about New York is how flat it is (or seems) until you turn around and see the incline behind you. I walked from my hotel to GCS and back, just had to make sure to walk in the shade. It was a terrific afternoon. Today was spent running errands. Took the subway to Macy\\'s and got a few things.It\\'s annoying\\nthat you/I cannot purchase 90% cotton socks or peds in stores any longer. Online only.\\nMonday is a work day, with meetings, etc., but also made dinner plans in Brooklyn with friends, which will be nice. And love how quick efficient the subway ride is, Going back and forth is easy and straightforward.\\nEdited: 12:47 am, October 04, 2021 Hey, I remember Mel, and I recall we met in San Francisco once too.\\nI should root out Mel\\'s details and meet up with him when I\\'m in NYC next March (can you believe it will be 3 years since I was last there - thank you pandemic).\\nGreat to get some LES recommendations as well, I\\'m staying at the Nolitan next time so can add some of these to my list (no doubt I\\'ll need a good coffee first thing!)\\nM My final day today in New York and it was quite a trip! Yesterday and last night, plans to get together with friends got sidelined somewhat. It was raining and work demands took over for everyone; however, last night dinner plans in Brooklyn had computer snafus. Computer broke and the appointment at Apple took hours, as the staff was like a new hire and didn\\'t get the assistance he needed from other staff per my friends.\\nSince I hadn\\'t eaten since breakfast, I opted to have dinner at an outside table at Al Di La in Park Slope Brooklyn. The food was fabulous. I ordered spaghetti with clams and garlic and a side of kale with lemon and chili pepper flakes. The food was wonderful and as I was walking down the street to the subway, I pass both my friends who were no-shows. Turns out, we all went back to their place so they could eat their take-out and we all enjoyed an hour visiting on the couches sipping tea. A broken phone and a broken laptop, it doesn\\'t get much worse than that. We had a really nice visit filled with laughter, few good curses and joy that the day was over. I left close to 11:00 PM and walked to the subway and reached my hotel close to 1:00 AM local time.\\nThere\\'s not much any of us can do when life turns on a dime, aside from implementing a Plan B, which each of us did , and ended with quite a nice night. It was a great trip and so glad I visited this beautiful city with some really terrific strangers willing to answer a question, provide directions or simply nod hello as you walk by. I love this city and am eager to come back, again, soon!\\nGlobe\\nP.S. M4RKM, BrooklynMel says hello! =) Does anyone know how long it will take until the crown of the Statue of Liberty is reopened to the public, considering it has been closed since March 16, 2020. I do know that the pedestal reopened on July 1, 2021 after being closed since March 16, 2020 and the Statue of Liberty Museum and Ellis Island Immigration Museum reopened August 24, 2020. Liberty Island reopened on July 20, 2020 after the monuement was closed since March 16, 2020. So, does anyone know why the crown of the Statue of Liberty is still closed when the pedestal has been open since July this year and what will have to happen for the crown to reopen? I was going to ask you that question as you seem to be the foremost authority on observatories and viewpoinys The crown is a small space likely with poor ventilation with people huffing and puffing from their climb. They may have felt that it might be prudent to wait a while. You may have already seen this website:\\nhttps://www.nps.gov/stli/planyourvisit/reopening-covid-details.htm What will have to happen for the crown to reopen? I think you\\'d have to ask the NPS for an answer to your question. As has been said before on this forum on a variety of subjects - our crystal balls seem to be broken. How long was it closed after 9/11/01? I just looked it up on Google. The crown was closed for 8 years after 9/11/01. Going up to the crown and back down involves two sets of narrow stairs where you are very close to the person above you and the one below you. And everyone will likely be huffing and puffing and breathing in and breathing out germs. And as mentioned in post 3, the viewing area in the crown is small -- 6 visitors plus a docent would be a crowd. Don\\'t expect the crown to reopen soon What is the pedestal like that makes it safe to reopen? I\\'ve got a trip planned for the end of March 2022, how far in advance should I apply for an ESTA, thanks You can apply for it right now if you wish. You can wait until the new entry requirements are outlined by the US Govt.\\nIt will be good for 2 years once approved.\\nMake sure you apply via the official site:\\nhttps://esta.cbp.dhs.gov\\nEdited: 11:23 am, yesterday My trip is in December and did mine last week as wasnt sure how long it would take to be approved or if covid restrictions would affect anything. It was approved really efficiently within a few hours so I probably didn\\'t need to so it so far in advance, but I like to be organised! If you\\'re planning on returning within 2 years, I\\'d do it around 2 weeks before - as long as you know you fit the criteria.\\nIf you think this is your only trip to the USA in the next 2 years, do it now and you won\\'t have to worry.\\nIf you have any concerns about the Esta criteria, do it now, then you have time to visit the embassy to get a Visa..\\nI\\'ve got a trip planned in Jan and March 2022, and won\\'t do mine until late December at the earliest, but I\\'m not overly worried it as I still have a few years on my Global Entry (so I have a known traveller number and it shouldn\\'t be a huge issue getting one for me).\\nEdited: 12:49 pm, yesterday You can get an ESTA now, and I would advise doing so as soon as possible.\\nI am going to the US at the end of April 2022, and I applied for my ESTA as soon as the change to the travel rules was announced a couple of weeks ago, and it was approved in less than an hour.\\nDo make sure that you only apply through the official site\\nhttps://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/\\nOn this site, the cost of an ESTA is US$14.00,\\nEdited: 1:50 pm, yesterday Thank you all for your replies, very helpful. Note that some, on another forum, have reported problems with that website, but by waiting a day or two managed to complete the task. So don\\'t be surprised if you encounter a glitch; just be patient and maybe wait a day or two. Will be flying into La Guardia late from Greece and need a hotel close by to stay overnight and catch connecting flight next day. Please advise. Thanks. Do you mean JFK? There are no flights from Europe arriving at LaGuardia. Are you sure you\\'re landing at LGA? (Unlikely as the perimeter rule doesn\\'t permit flights from that far away. Maybe arriving at JFK?)\\nIf you need a place to sleep for an LGA departure there are a number of adjacent hotels\\nThe ones a bit east near Main Street Flushing have dining options within walking distance https://goo.gl/maps/1NqSwQGDq17E7fUp7 There are several hotels \"across the street\" from LGA, but these are in a somewhat isolated place in terms of other businesses. Since you are coming in late and may not have time for other things, this may not matter to you. These hotels often provide car services to the nearby airport. I would be certain LGA is the correct destination. Not every hotel with \"LaGuardia\" in its name is actually so close to the airport. Staying on E 50th street and looking for recommendations on where to eat on NYE?\\nWe are a family of 5 - mum, dad, 18 yr old and 2 kids age 17 and 12. (1 is fussy eater so nothing too fancy).\\nWould we be better off eating out early?\\nStay close to accommodation?\\nWould we be mad tying to get to Central Park? In fact are the fireworks even going ahead this year? How far east?\\nEdited: 12:07 pm, October 04, 2021 You definitely want to stay east of 5th Avenue, as you will find it very difficult to get past the barricades they put up there to control the crowds for the Ball Drop.\\nToo soon to know if there will be fireworks this year.\\nLiterally dozens of restaurants within a 10 minute walk of Park and 50th for every preference and budget I believe we are close to the Rockerfeller centre.... Inside the Exclusion zone could make things difficult. Can you find out for sure so we can give you advice? It makes a huge difference, and also restricts your motion significantly\\n5th Avenue is the split between streets with the \"W\" and with the \"E\" before the number, so if you truly are on East 50th, then no worries about the exclusion zone.\\nEdited: 2:15 pm, October 04, 2021 We are staying at Fifty suites just off 3rd Avenue. Would we be better off eating out early?\\n-Not necessarily. The city will be very crowded(especially if Times Sq is a go) but the further away you are from the main area, the less you will notice it.\\nStay close to accommodation?\\n-Again, not necessarily. I have spent many NYE in the city and once I was not in the TS area, I was fine.\\nWould we be mad tying to get to Central Park? In fact are the fireworks even going ahead this year?\\n-Not at all. Thousands of people make that a part of their NYE every year. I don\\'t believe the fireworks have been confirmed as of today. I could be wrong. If the CP fireworks (which will hopefully go on) interest you, finding someplace to have dinner adjacent to CP but outside of the TS frozen zone is probably best.\\nI don\\'t see any particular reason to have dinner early - a later dinner someplace convenient to the park would be simpler IMO\\nFinding cabs on NYE is difficult (and cabs that hold 5 are uncommon) so after the fireworks you\\'ll want to head back to your hotel by walking over to the subway line that runs along Lexington avenue https://new.mta.info/map/5256\\nSometime late morning or early afternoon consider a walk through TS so you can see the area before the frozen zone goes into effect https://www.timessquarenyc.org/times-square-new-years-eve/nye-faq **Sometime late morning or early afternoon consider a walk through TS so you can see the area before the frozen zone goes into effect**\\n^\\nI highly suggest this....BUT early/mid morning. I am talking before 10am.\\nI have volunteered in the area several times on NYE and always try to walk through the area in the AM. By the time I am done...11am...the place is packed and many of the streets in that immediate area are closed off. Fifty Suites is well away from the Restricted area. It isn\\'t really that close to Rockefeller Plaza, either. A good 10 minute walk away Thanks for all your comments.\\nA 10 minute walk is fine by us.....\\nI have a new concern now....we don\\'t actually fly into New York until NYE. We fly into JFK and arrive around 3pm. Are we going to be ok getting taxi to our accommodation or will we have issues? Hi all, quick question for you. What is the best way to see the 5 boroughs of New York in one day? I have seen some tour companies offering excursions by coach / minibus but rather suspect this will be a rush job. I have been to NYC once and am returning next month for a short break Any way you do that will be a rush job. Why do you want to do that?\\nCircle Line boat around Manhattan you can SEE all 5 boroughs, NYC is a city of over 300 sq/mi\\nI cannot think of any way you can have a meaningful & enjoyable tourist visit to all five boroughs in one day\\nI am intrigued that you are apparently seeing bus tours that claim to offer that(?). What is on their itinerary? Can you provide links? Look, I\\'m a sort of \"encyclopedic tourist\", who wants to do a \"complete\" job when I travel. But there is simply no value to such a product. What you want to do is to spend your limited time in NYC seeing things that are meaningful to you or of interest to you.\\nJust as a made-up example, why would a drive-by of the Brooklyn Museum and Prospect Park be a superior use of your time than a physical visit inside a museum that is world-class and covers something you feel passionate about. ( I don\\'t mean Trolls or Ice Cream of course, I mean arts, science, design, ethnic history ... )\\nIt\\'s perfectly true that people brought up in Manhattan like me are a little snooty about \"the outer boroughs.\" But I\\'m glad I had a summer job in the Bronx (and at the Queens World\\'s Fair), and visited my grandparents there in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s. And I\\'m glad my elementary school bussed me to the Jacques Marchais museum in Staten Island. But it took most of a day.\\nEdited: 10:14 am, October 02, 2021 As others have said - you can’t “see” all 5 boroughs in a day (or in a lifetime, really). If as some sort of fun self-challenge you want to set foot in all five boroughs in a day - or even see one characteristic destination in each one - then that’s easy to do. Let’s say you’re starting in Manhattan - grab a bagel and lox somewhere near your hotel (check). Hop on the 4 or D train - whichever is handier - and go up to Yankee Stadium in the Bronx (check). Take the 4 back down to Grand Central (another Manhattan “check”) and transfer to a Flushing-bound 7…take in the elevated views of Queens and get off according to your interests…could be Jackson Heights for food and residential architecture, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park for the general vibe & the iconic Unisphere, could be Flushing Chinatown (checks all).\\nThree down, two to go…settle in on the F (which you can get at Roosevelt Av/Jackson Heights) and ride back through Manhattan (options to get off at Bryant Park or Lower East Side) and then on to Brooklyn. You’ll get impressive views when the train emerges from underground and climbs to the highest subway station in the world at Smith-9th. You could call that your Brooklyn “check,” but why not continue on to Prospect Park? Or get off earlier (or reverse course at Smith-9th and backtrack) at Carroll St to stroll picturesque Carroll Gardens/cobble Hill/Boerum Hill…or even earlier at York St to see Dumbo and walk the bridge back to Manhattan.\\nI’ve saved Staten Island for last…get yourself back to Manhattan by whatever means (foot, bike, ferry, subway), then catch the Staten Island ferry and soak up the views. Get pizza (Staten Island has a distinctive style) or Sri Lankan food if you want before ferrying back to Manhattan.\\nFinal check!\\nThis is just an example, obviously - the point is it’s not hard (and could even be fun) to put together your own whirlwind tour, as long as you’re aware you’re barely scratching the surface.\\nEdited: 10:55 am, October 02, 2021 Sign up to run the NYC Marathon next year.\\n(Linda, that’s impressive. I remember as a kid when we hit 5 boroughs in one day a few times because of various school activities. My poor Irene’s).\\nEdited: 11:23 am, October 02, 2021 In 6, that was supposed to be “parents”. Don’t know what’s up w auto correct. #8: hahaha, I wondered about that! I thought maybe “Irenes” was a classic brand of children’s shoes. Admirable but a pointless exercise mainly due to the diversity of areas within each borough. Imagine visiting a Glasgow suburb and saying you\\'ve seen Glasgow. Thats most likely what you\\'ll do in each borough.\\nInstead, consider this. Visit Sunset Park in Brooklyn, particularly 5th ave (in the 40\\'s), and 8th ave (in the 50\\'s). You\\'ll see two distinct neighborhoods in one (there\\'s actually a third but concentrate on these two) and youll get a much better feel of outer borough life than doing what you are trying to do. And a world class cemetery (Greenwood) to boot if you have the time. We can help further with the itinerary if needed. Staying near the Central Park/midtown but willing to travel for an authentic Italian caffe - like the coffee bar where you stay and drink espresso. Not necessarily the standing part but the authentic cappuccinos you get in Italy Check out Bar Pisellino at 52 Grove St, corner of 7th Ave.\\nOtherwise, Sant Ambroeus has a few caffe/geletaria locations Caffe Reggio which is not only an authentic Italian caffe but also was featured in many movies Supposedly Cafe Figaro, which was a real institution for decades, is being reincarnated (although completely new) in the same location https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2021/01/12/greenwich-village-hot-spot-le-figaro-cafe-plots-comeback/amp/ Zibetto Espresso Bar has a few locations, two on 6th Ave in Midtown and one on Park Ave not far from the ESB (check whether this one is open though).\\nhttp://www.zibettoespresso.com/about/ Plus 1 for Cafe Reggio Il Buco Alimentari & Vineria if you around. Zibetto on 6th Ave. & 56 st. Mentioned by Aynat is closest to where you’re staying. Via Quadronno on the upper east side (Madison & 73 st.) is another place . So this is a win for all of the people who don\\'t want to swipe/scan their phones/credit/debit cards to utilize OMNY!\\nIt\\'s basically a Metrocard...for the OMNY platform. Very good option for NYC and I applaud the MTA for not \"pushing\" the 3 options on the millions of people who use the subway every year!\\nPlus it\\'s a nice souvenir for tourists. Not as nice as the current Metrocard IMO, but still a keepsake.\\nhttps://www.curbed.com/2021/10/omny-card-launched-mta-nyc-reveal.html#comments Oooh exciting.

This will be my 4th visit but first time staying dt. We want to dive into the surrounding area. Looking for any restaurant suggestions with a cool vibe/scene or bar. We\\'re in our early 40\\'s, enjoy whiskey bar/lounge type places, any kind of cuisine and hotel bar scenes. Not sure what things look like with covid regulations in place. Any recommendations are appreciated! I stayed downtown on my last visit, I really enjoyed the meal I had at the Fulton, good food and amazing views. There seemed to be a very lively bar upstairs.\\nI also enjoyed a late night snack and wine at The View at Battery Park. Bear in mind that I haven\\'t been since the pandemic started so all my experiences are from awhile ago.\\nThe Fulton is a good suggestion, if you like fish and seafood. One of my favorites too.\\nNear your hotel:\\nMerchants River House\\nLiberty Bistro\\nIf you\\'re willing to walk to Tribeca, there are SO many good options in that area for dining. You could easily eat your way around the area for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks in between during your entire visit and trying a new place for every meal. A few of my favorites there are:\\nFrenchette\\nLocanda Verde\\nSarabeth\\'s\\nGigino Trattoria - it\\'s not spectacular, but a solid spot that is a \\'local institution\\' when it comes to Italian restaurants. Very homey.\\nThe Odeon is an institution in the area.\\nBubby\\'s - fun and casual. The Conrad is kind of on the line between the general Battery Park/Financial District area and Tribeca, on the west side. Seamore\\'s across the street (sort of, just ask) always has a good bar scene when I walk by, although I\\'ve never walked in - just lots of people. There\\'s Oculus Beer Garden just north of the Oculus. The bar at The Beekman Hotels Temple Court is absolutely gorgeous, and sometimes a good scene (hard to say with Covid, I was there a few weeks ago and it was not very crowded, I think crowds are slowly returning). Locande Verde does have a bar scene, as does Frenchette. There\\'s also a bar near Duane St Park called Weather Up that\\'s fun.\\nCity Harvest might be fun for you, on the water, a little further up at Pier 26, very walkable from The Conrad.\\nWalk across from west to east on Fulton St and that will put you at the Seaport, there is a big open bar in the middle that has a happy hour scene, and R17 on the rooftop of Pier 17 is nice.\\nFelice which is the restaurant spilling off of Gild Hall has a happy hour bar scene that sometime re-energizes later in the evening. Get a table in the bar area or eat at the bar - it\\'s very social. Crown Shy is more upscale and also has a good bar scene. They are both in the other direction, further south/east from The Conrad. Also check out the bar at American Cut. If you end up in the South St area I would also try Stone Street - we enjoyed it there pre-COVID whilst staying at the Conrad\\nEdited: 2:38 am, yesterday through October 9.

Note though children under 12 are not allowed at fall season performances, they can attend Nutcracker performances if they present proof of negative result on PCR test done no more than 72 hours before performance. I assume they would do away with this if it becomes possible for kids to get vaccinated, though it is unlikely many would be fully vaccinated before the performance. People who have medical or religious reasons for not being vaccinated also allowed if they have the same proof of negative PCR result, though I believe they have to contact the ballet ahead of time and provide proof for their exception.

The Queens Museum also has one of if not the largest collections of Tiffany lamps on display. They were made in nearby Corona to the west. The former Tiffany Studios factory stood until 2012 when it was demolished for a school. Small shards of glass were found and sorted by color and placed in plexiglass bins mounted on the wall of the school as a sort of artwork.\\nFlushing is primarily about food unless the 34 bank branches near the subway interest you. There are definite ethnic areas with a sort of invisible Great Wall of China along Union St. dividing the Chinese from Koreans to the east. There is also a south Asian area south of the downtown. The Bowne House and the Quaker Meeting date from the late 1600s. If you have a car, combing the Queens County Farm with Flushing Meadows Corona Park is an enjoyable day trip. Go to Astoria and see the Hell Gate Bridge which is a smaller version of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Walk under the bridge (it\\'s a nice walk, it\\'ll feel surreal seeing the bridge if you\\'ve ever been near the Sydney Harbour Bridge), go to the Welling Court Mural area, walk to Socrates Park or the Noguchi Museum, have some Greek food in Astoria then if you have time go to the Museum of the Moving Image (excellent).\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Gate_Bridge\\nhttps://secretnyc.co/best-greek-food-astoria/\\nTake the ferry to Astoria from Manhattan, that\\'s another good way to get around and kids would love it.\\nhttps://ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/astoria/\\nOr, reverse the day and start at the Museum then work back towards the water and end the day with the ferry trip. Hoping to walk through chinatown & eating as we go. It appears that Xi’an foods has to go - for soup dumpling/dumpling shops (joes, vanessa’s, shu jiao) offer to go & is there a place to pause or sit to eat outdoors? We are fully vax’d just want to do a DIY walking food tour. Chinatown parks are great! My husband and I frequently bring food to Columbus Park and Seward Park. They have benches, some tables, and (decently clean, for public) bathrooms. They\\'re also great for people watching. Columbus Park is convenient to most places, but for maximum enjoyment I would try to eat the dishes as soon as you get them, preferably in or near the establishments. In the park it will be saucy, messy and uncomfortable for the type of food you are planning. And the longer you wait to eat, say Xian\\'s cumin lamb noodles, the worse they\\'ll become There’s a little street called Doyers St, entrance on Division Street. There’s a dumplings place on that street that ALWAYS has a line. I don’t like dumplings so have never eaten there. But it’s a fun little enclave and worth checking out what’s on the street. (Also a great “speakeasy” called Apotheke on that street. **say Xian\\'s cumin lamb noodles, the worse they\\'ll become**\\nDefinitely agree with ^.\\nWhen I first started going to the other Chinatown location many years ago, I would get an additional cumin lamb noodles to go. It was just not the same at all. Are there any codes available yet? Put yourself on the mailing lists for Playbill, TheaterMania & Radio City & you\\'ll be among the 1st to get discount notifications.

It\\'s a bit early to get reservations for Christmas & there is little way to predict what still will be open but it\\'s a start. This thread is from the FAQs on the right of the screen & it should be updated in a month or so for 2021. Stewart is at 31st street. In 2019 restrictions started at 33rd street. Any suggestions for the best place to eat on Christmas Day evening - ideally family friendly and relaxed. Are you looking for something Christmas / holiday specific in terms of a meal, and if so, what type of meal? I know my traditional kind of Christmas meal differs wildly from a lot of what my UK friends eat for example.\\nOr are you looking for a family friendly meal of any kind, and if so - likes and dislikes for the family when it comes to food? Hi - any kind of family friendly meal to be honest so long as the food is good and it\\'s a nice atmosphere. No real dislikes - the kids love Italian, Chinese, Mexican and American food. A LOT of Chinese restaurants will be open on Christmas Day. In (Manhattan) Chinatown (there are other Chinatowns in both Queens and Brooklyn as well), but also all over the place in Manhattan. I hope others have suggestion for places, it\\'s been awhile since I had a meal in Manhattan - my latest experience is from Sunset Park in Brooklyn.\\nBear in my mind that I haven\\'t been to NYC since the pandemic started so all my suggestions are \\'old\\' in that sense and you need to look at their menus to see if you like them.\\nFor Mexican, a couple of my favorites are:\\nTacuba\\nABC Cocina - which is a bit more adventurous when it comes to dishes so look at the menu to see if it fits everyone.\\nCheck to see if the above Mexican ones are open on Christmas Day.\\nSome of my favorite Italian places are (sadly, the one I had my non-Christmas meal at during my last Christmas visit is now closed):\\nAgain, you need to check to see if these are open on Christmas Day too. I can\\'t remember from my holiday research which ones that usually are - my more recent trips have been during other seasons.\\nBabbo\\nMaialino - a bit more upscale perhaps\\nGnocco\\nGigino\\'s Trattoria\\nMonte\\'s - if this one is open, it\\'s a very family friendly place that has been operated by the same family for several generations.

It\\'s from the FAQs on the right of the screen & the 2021 listing hasn\\'t yet been posted (it should be posted in a month or so. Does anyone know if the Michelangelo Hotel remains \"temporarily closed,\" and, if so, any news about when (if?) they plan to reopen? The direct hotel website states that they are closed, but also allows that future reservations may be made, albeit at a discounted rate. I\\'ve also noticed that many of the 3rd party booking sites are offering the hotel so I\\'m hoping they have not closed their door forever! Have you tried calling them? I\\'ve done that for a few NYC hotels where it was hard to tell if they were truly open or not.\\nYou are wise to question third party offerings. I would never use one of those companies, even the most reliable ones, during Covid. The hotel has been temporary closed due to Covid and may be reopening with the international travel restrictions being lifted. Hotels.com is not taking reservations until after October 17 2021, date for reopening is tentative and subject to change. It seems a bit risky to book ahead without a solid reopening date! I did try calling and it seems that you can leave a message for the GM, but there was no chance of getting a live person. I actually made a fully refundable reservation directly through their website, AND have a back-up reservation elsewhere just in case...but we plan to visit in early December, so I will keep my fingers crossed and will keep checking for updated info. Thanks! My wife and i are coming to New York City and are celebrating new years eve in the big city.\\nWe are 32 qnd 27 years old from Belgium and are looking around so see what New York has to offer on NYE.\\nWe know about the ball drop on Time Square and the boat cruises on the Hudson but we were wondering if there are other less known but evenly as beautifull places in the city to spend new years eve. We are staying in a hotel on E27th street near 5th avenue.\\nWe are not really party people so we are not really looking for a club or a big party. If I return to NYC for New Years sometime in the future, I\\'d do what I did the last time I was there for the holidays. Attend the New Years eve gala at the Met opera. Lovely!\\nNot less known, but a bit less crowded than the ball drop: The fireworks in Central Park, if they will be resumed this year that is. There are parties for which you need to buy tickets, restaurants and bars that you can just walk into, casually.\\nYou need to think about whether you want to be all dressed up, or be casual, whether you want to spend $1000 per person, or pay for a couple of beers and a glass of champagne. Look on websites like EventBrite.com, get the Fever app, pulsd.com, and for restaurants, opentable.com. But it is much too early now, start looking in November (towards the end) for events and pricing at restaurants etc. Next Sunday(Oct 3), Brooklyn, NY will again host one of the biggest street fairs in the NYC!\\nThe Atlantic Antic runs from 4th Ave all the way down to the water. It touches Ft Greene, downtown Bklyn, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill.\\nThe many stores lining Atlantic Ave will be setup on the sidewalk and loads of attractions and events are planned. Food and drinks will also be available!\\nThis event is always/usually held on the first Sunday in Oct and I have been attending for years...as I live a few blocks away. This is really a can\\'t miss event if you are in the area!\\nVenture down Smith St or Court Street and explore the neighborhoods! Stop at Bar Tabac on Smith St and you will probably see me there hanging with the regulars!\\nBut don\\'t stop there....\\nThe Brooklyn Book Festival has \"Festival Day\" on Oct 3! This is also a great event right along Borough Hall. There will be multiple vendors/authors/publishing houses set up selling/giving away and speaking on a wide variety of.....books!\\nI always attend Festival Day. There are usually food trucks set up towards the post office/Cadman Plaza Park.\\nKeep going......down to DUMBO/Bklyn Bridge Park for Photoville!\\nAnother stellar event that I always get to. Bonus....a magnificent view of the city skyline in the background!\\nStill game?\\nCheck out the Brooklyn Flea in DUMBO! You can get some stellar pics under the Manhattan Bridge arch. Grab a brew. Peruse the vendors. Listen to some music. Eat!\\nTake a pic of the bridge and the Empire State Building sandwiched between! This is a great photo op if you don\\'t visit the area much!\\nWe really know how to throw a \"party\"!\\nhttps://patch.com/new-york/parkslope/circus-joins-brooklyns-atlantic-antic-block-party-2021-return\\nhttps://brooklynbookfestival.org\\nhttps://photoville.nyc\\nhttps://brooklynflea.com/markets/dumbo\\nhttps://triptins.com/manhattan-bridge-view-spot-dumbo/ Great information!! Thank you. Hi ter, this festival, (and your whole thread), sounds so great, and I wish I could go. I can’t believe I have never heard of it before. We did go to the Smith Street Soup Festival a few years ago, but that was a tiny (different) happening compared to this. (But so fun, too!)\\nI do highly agree with your recommendations of making a day of it and exploring more. I can vouch for poking about the shops and restaurants of Smith and Court Streets and the brownstones of the side streets and soaking up that whole cool vibe of the area. Also for Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Brooklyn Flea.\\nWow. Wish I had a fall trip planned. ✈️🍂🗽🍂😎 I just moved my \"Brooklyn Day\" to this Sunday! Now I have too much to do in one day! I\\'ll be in DC otherwise I\\'d be there. ** I just moved my \"Brooklyn Day\" to this Sunday! **\\nNote that this is for NEXT Sunday....Oct 3! **We did go to the Smith Street Soup Festival a few years ago**\\nYep...the Soup fest was fun. Smith St/Court St on the weekends is always fun.\\nI live down the block/just off of Smith in the heart of Boerum Hill, and at times, I forget about the smaller events until I walk outside. **Great information!! Thank you.**\\nNo problemo! The photo exhibits in Brooklyn Bridge Park sound great!! I almost forgot.....don\\'t end your day at the Brooklyn Flea.....\\nHead to the Time Out Market/Empire Stores for some more perusing, food and drinks. Rest up on the rooftop with some more of those stellar views of the city skyline.\\nThen.....and only then....if you got a jolt of energy relaxing on the rooftop.....walk back into the city over the Brooklyn Bridge!\\nhttps://www.timeoutmarket.com/newyork/ **The photo exhibits in Brooklyn Bridge Park sound great!!**\\nIt really is.\\nI haven\\'t been as yet this year but they had each exhibit in shipping containers which made the presentation very unique:\\nhttps://youtu.be/iUHHKuKuiMk\\nThis was opening day...2021:\\nhttps://youtu.be/CQToYNndGrA\\n^\\nNone of the vids are mine. Hey!\\nMy boyfriend and I are travelling to New York from 30th December for 5 nights and would love some advice on the best things to do at this time of year including on New Years Eve.\\nWe want to try and avoid Times Square itself unless there\\'s any hotels/bars doing events with a good view of the action but are open to any ideas with a party and fireworks!\\nThanks so much. We don\\'t know what New years eve will look like yet, so it isn\\'t really possible to plan for specific events. May have a better idea by November how things are looking. States like Florida are posting record daily numbers of covid cases. Anything you book I would make sure is refundable. If you aren\\'t doing times square there is typically a midnight run in central park with some fireworks as well. It is cool. There are often other events all across the city, cruises, special events at clubs etc. Some events can be pricey. It really depends on what type of environment you want. I would book whatever restaurant you want in advance though. The first thing that you need to realize is that if you are coming from the UK, you will not be able to board the flight to the US....as of today.\\nYou need to monitor the situation...and hopefully you have refundable air/hotel/etc.\\nWhat would I do? I would wait until Oct/Nov to understand the situation and take it from there. As others have mentioned, the pandemic situation is quite unpredictable at this time. There are few places with views of the Times Square ball drop and those are in great demand and of high price. It is better to watch on TV especially if the weather does not cooperate. The period you mention is a busy time for tourists in NYC normally. The Met Museum can have lines out the door. The Rockefeller Center tree draws huge crowds even after Christmas, normally. Plan your trip, but as suggested by others, keep refunds in mind if you must cancel. As Ter1413 has said - you can\\'t fly to the USA if you\\'re a UK Passport holder at the moment. The borders are still closed, and there are no reports of when, or if they will reopen.\\nDon\\'t book anything you can\\'t cancel.\\nWhen the borders open, then I\\'d come back and check out what could be happening Assuming the border is open and you\\'re able to come (though I agree with others that the situation is constantly changing so make sure your plans are flexible), what kinds of things are you interested in? Are you thinking more outdoorsy stuff like ice skating or walking through the parks or boat trips, more indoorsy stuff like museums or shopping or theater (crossing my fingers that Broadway and other theaters open back up as planned!), or a mix of both? For NYE, are you hoping for a big event, or something smaller and more lowkey? Keep in mind that the cost of the few bars and restaurants with a really good view of the ball drop will be in the hundreds of dollars per person and hotel rooms with good views will be in the thousands of dollars. And if you decide to stay on the streets of Times Square jammed in with a million or so others to watch the festivities, you would have to arrive hours, many hours before midnight to get a good viewing place -- and there will be no bathroom facilities (wear adult diapers), no food vendors, few if any place to sit down, and if you leave the frozen area for any reason, the police will not allow you back in. Better to watch the festivities on your hotel room TV or a TV in a bar or restaurant away from Times Square **Better to watch the festivities on your hotel room TV **\\nI laugh each and every time someone suggests this.\\nWhy come to one of the great NYE cities and sit in your hotel room? A bar/restaurant? Yes. Definitely not your hotel room. Not to mention, the OP already said they want to avoid Times Square unless they can find someplace with a view, so it sounds like they understand the reality of NYE in Times Square. Hey!\\nThanks so much for your replies so far.\\nCompletely understand the current travel restrictions and have booked with an airline / hotel that are all fully refundable or moveable should we be unable to travel.\\nHappy to pay up to a few hundred dollars per person for a good meal / tickets to an event on NYE suited to a young couple looking to have a memorable evening but without the crazy crowds of Times Square.\\nDefinitely don’t want to be sat in our hotel room though for sure!\\nI’ve seen a few boat trips advertised with views of the fireworks from the Statue of Liberty but not sure if these are any good or we should avoid?\\nJust looking for genuine recommendations for places to go and make the most of our trip.\\nAlso plan to book tickets to a Broadway show, visit tourist locations such as Empire State, rockafella, basketball game etc.\\nGenuinely all ideas welcome!\\nEdited: 11:07 am, August 16, 2021 I was in New York today (I live in New Jersey and go to New York often). For restaurants, Broadway and other shows, probably stores - you will need to show proof of vaccination or you will not be able to enter. Not sure about museums.\\nAlso wearing masks inside is required even if you are vaccinated.\\nWith respect to New Year’s Eve in New York, I would recommend the week before Christmas as a better experience.\\nIn 1985 I went to Times Square to watch the ball drop and was mugged by a gang of 10 teenagers.\\nEver since 1985 I just watch NYE on TV. But Christmas time in New York is special and safe. Any recommendations for restaurants with plenty of dairy-free/no lactose options? Any location is fine. Thanks for any input. 🙂 Try searching yelp. Should provide a number of options. Indian, Chinese, well, almost all Asian restaurants would work, wouldn’t they? Kosher meat restaurants would be a great option.\\nAlso, please note that most restaurants have become very sensitive to food allergy issues. I’m asked almost every time if there are any allergies. You can even order pizza without cheese, although I would be concerned about cross contamination in small pizza places.\\nAnd of course, vegan restaurants. There are more and more every day.\\nEdited: 3:37 pm, October 03, 2021 Hi Risa, yes, those kinds of foods should work. Did you have any specific suggestions or recommendations? Edit: Maybe I should specify that I’m wondering about specific restaurants that others who are also lactose intolerant like? I think it’s more about menu items than restaurants, honestly. Pretty much any restaurant can accommodate you. Maybe you could help us make suggestions by telling us a little more about the kinds of food you like or are interested in trying, and where in the city you’ll be staying and spending time. I know you said “any location,” but it’s a big city with literally thousands of places to eat lactose-free meals.\\n(One caution - my nephew was vegan for a while, and on that basis I’d suggest being careful of Indian restaurants because of the use of ghee for frying and yogurt in sauces and marinades.) I agree with the above, I am lactose intolerant and have never looked for restaurants that cater to that issue, I just don’t order items that I know have dairy in them when that might be an issue. Thank you! I totally forgot about the ghee and yogurt in some Indian foods 😬 👍\\nEdited: 7:32 pm, October 03, 2021 Northern Traveler Thanks!\\nEdited: 7:33 pm, October 03, 2021 Check this list of dairy-free restaurants in the entire state of New York from Alisa Fleming, who writes the Go Dairy Free books and blog:\\nhttps://www.godairyfree.org/dining-out/new-york-dairy-free-restaurants\\nA good, well-trained chef can modify most recipes to eliminate lactose. But I have found that in some restaurants, the order takers are not so well trained and don\\'t understand what lactose intolerance is. I have had to explain it to them and tell them they must relay the information to the kitchen. I have had dishes served to me that were swimming in butter because the order taker didn\\'t tell the chef that I am lactose intolerant tantalus - you are awesome; thank you so much! ❤️ My husband, daughter (age 12) and I will be in NYC this month and are torn between two hotels - Moderne Hotel and M Social Times Square (both are booked with refundable reservations). We have a junior suite booked at the Moderne and a 2 double bed “City View” room at M Social. Which would you recommended overall? I prefer the Moderne\\'s location a little further north and closer to Central Park but I don\\'t think it\\'s been modernised in the last few years (I could be wrong though). Some reviews mention maintenance issues.\\nThe M Social is a little more modern and has a terrace bar that looks down towards Times Square.\\nThe Junior Suite at the Moderne is a bigger room size if that is important to you, but the City View room at the M Social is still a good size by New York standards.\\nFor location, they both have good subway access nearby.\\nI think I would choose the M Social but that\\'s just my taste and preference.\\nEdited: 6:02 pm, October 03, 2021 The hotels are only 5 mins. Walk from each other so I don\\'t think either is better than the other from that point of view. You don\\'t mention what the bedding situation is in the jr. Suite and I don\\'t know. I think it comes down to which has the more appealing bed setup for your family and how important a view is to you. Frankly, a hotel with 2 queen beds would be preferable to me. In the same general area, the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square has double queen rooms and higher floors have views. Aynat62 this is very helpful; thank you! nywhiz Thank you very much! We\\'re 2 weeks out and I can\\'t wait!!! We\\'re flying in 9:30 am on a Sunday to LGA, and it being our 25th Anniversary, first trip to NYC and first/last time flying First Class, I was wondering if the Ubers were cleaner/nicer than a taxi. I\\'ve looked at pricing and nothing I\\'ve seen leads me to one option over the other. We\\'re not against using cabs for getting around or anything like that, but if the Ubers in NYC are as clean as the ones we had in Chicago, it\\'s a no brainer for an arrival. Thanks again for your help! Ubers tend to be newer and are very clean. Taxis have to comply w cleanliness rules and are pretty clean but not always in great condition, giving them a less appealing impression. But they’re clean. That\\'s a tough question to answer. From my experience, some are amazingly clean. Some are disgusting. Most are in between those two extremes. Just like the Ubers we used in St. Louis earlier this year. Both are clean. Ubers are usually nicer cars and more comfortable, but in terms of being clean my experience is they are both clean. Very cool, thanks again for the info. Be aware at LGA you must meet your car service at the designated area adjacent to the terminal https://www.laguardiaarirport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides\\nThere are Yellow cab dispatcher lines curbside at each terminal\\nFor a return to the airport a car service can drop off at the curb In my experience, they’ve always been very clean and the drivers are professionals. The thing you have to realize is that in a lot of other places, Uber/Lyft drivers are doing it as a side gig, in NY for many it’s their sole business. Since you are flying first class, another option is a car service such as Carmel or Dial7. I\\'ve used both and they were both very clean and not that much more expensive than a taxi. In NYC the app service vehicles & drivers are licensed & regulated as \"for hire vehicle\" car services https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/businesses/for-hire-vehicles.page I believe the OP is back from their trip.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13688242-Trip_Report_9_26_9_30-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nEdited: 1:25 pm, October 04, 2021 My friends and I are doing a girl’s trip to NYC November 6-9, and we would like to have brunch that Sunday. We will be staying near Times Square so something in that area would be preferable, but is not a must if you know of a place that’s worth the Uber ride. We don’t need anything too terribly fancy but mimosas on the menu is always a plus. All recommendations are appreciated- thanks in advance! If Norma’s is open I would go there. In general, the best brunches are in more residential areas. The only reason to stay in the TS area is if your plans for the rest of the day is there. Most every restaurant that serves brunch will have mimosas. Cookshop (in Chelsea near the High Line) and Buvette in Greenwich Village are 2 places that make a lot of brunch lists.\\nIf you do need to stay in midtown, Toloache is a Mexican place I like that does weekend brunch.\\nhttp://www.toloachenyc.com/assets/50brunch2.pdf\\nEdited: 3:02 pm, October 03, 2021 My top three would be Norma’s, Sarabeth’s, and Bryant Park Grill, in that order. You could also go to Cafe Un Deux Trois which is supposed to reopen this week, a classic in the immediate neighborhood. No brunch recs though you can\\'t really go wrong with a great bagel and finding a nice spot to people watch!\\nYou\\'re going to use the subway while in NYC, right? Your Uber comment has me wondering. How about brunch on a rooftop? It\\'s very New York. On a mild November day it might be nice.\\nCantina Rooftop is not far from Times Square and has Mexican food and drinks. The Haven Rooftop is modern American cuisine. The Refinery rooftop is another option. 230 Fifth is a popular place.\\nTake a look at this list with many other mentions: https://www.therooftopguide.com/rooftop-news/rooftop-brunch-in-new-york.html\\nAs with anything in these times, check what\\'s still open and their hours, if they\\'ll be open in November, and make a reservation if you can. One thing to consider is that Sunday is the NYC Marathon. You can head to First Avenue north of the 59th Street Bridge and find a place for brunch and to watch the marathon.\\nIf that\\'s not your thing then Norma\\'s and Sarabeth\\'s are both good suggestions. But Sarabeth\\'s on Central Park South may be difficult to get into because of the marathon so you might want to choose a different location. Balthazar on Spring St. also is well known for Brunch. Odeon downtown and Cafe Luxembourg on 70th between Amsterdam and West End both have nice brunches.\\nOther than Norma\\'s, also close to Times Square, I like Joe Allen for brunch and it\\'s fun people watching pre-theater. It\\'s on W. 46th St. My first choice would be Charlie Palmer in the Knickerbocker Hotel, but they may only be doing the buffet brunch for hotel guests at the moment. The buffet is actually very good for a buffet, but the full a la carté menu is the real star. Bryant Park Grill is also very good. I believe it is hard to find a place that accepts weekend brunch reservations. That means a long, annoying wait in line. In an imprecise way, food that can be seen from Times Square is likely to be inferior. (Personal opinion, not a statistical survey.) We are going to buy the extra ticket for the planetarium, so I\\'m trying to get a sense of how long we should dedicate to this museum. Same question for the MOMA?\\nThanks! Really depends on you and how slow or fast you want to move. Recommended times for natural museum of history is 3 1/2 hours if you are doing the planetarium as well. For MOMA recommended times are 2 1/2 hours. Some people do it in like an hour but they are rushing through just to cross the item off the check list. I don\\'t go slow in museums but I remember last time I was at the MOMA I didn\\'t even get to see like a whole floor of exhibits due to running out of time. I\\'d say at least 3 hours for the MNH but you could spend more time if you are really interested in certain areas, and as Red said, like to take your time. Hours and hours and hours. If you check out the museums online, you can get a sense of what might be of interest to you, and what you might want to skip over. Doing this will help you use your time more efficiently, but you are likely to discover exhibits or areas that you want to spend a little more time with. In many visits to AMNH, MOMA, and the Met, I have found browsing to be the most enjoyable, and so I always allow at least a half-day at each, with no deadline for exiting, to allow for those unexpected pleasures. If you don\\'t have that kind of time luxury, I would target specific exhibits/rooms/areas by advance online research, and then use any leftover time (if any) to wander. Going through one of these museums while clock-watching is depriving yourself of one of the pleasures of going to these places--the joy of unexpected discoveries. The AMNH is one of the largest museum buildings in the world and one can spend much time depending on one\\'s interests. They recently reopened their gems and minerals gallery that seems to be visually spectacular. Then there are the popular dino bones and the life-size whale model in the fish gallery. So much depends on the visitor that a suggested time is meaningless. One thing I use to factor how long to spend in a museum is that I get \\'museum\\'ed out\\'. A half day is enough for me, although I have been known to spend all day in the Met Museum and the National Gallery of Art in DC if I have a long break at lunch time.\\nAnother factor is the size of the crowd. The last time I went to the AMNH the crowds were so huge I was exhausted after a few hours and had to leave. That was before Covid so I don\\'t know what there ticketing arrangements are to provide for better physical distancing. At least 2-3 hours. With the larger museums it\\'s usually a good idea to look at the floor plan prior to your visit and either pick up a brochure when you arrive or download their visit aids beforehand https://www.amnh.org/plan-your-visit/museum-maps We are staying at the Courtyard by Marriot in Chelsea, arriving in the city around 6. What are some locally-owned, yummy restaurants within walking distance. I\\'m traveling with a 16 year old. After dinner we will visit the Empire State Building. Suggestions welcome and thanks in advance. Do you like Korean food? There are a ton of places on W32nd St between 5th and 6th Aves. Yes and we\\'d also love seafood, upscale hamburger, Italian, etc. Local and fun atmosphere There’s a Greek restaurant on that block. It’s adequate. There are better ones. But if you get stuck, it’s not bad. Shukette just opened up in that neighborhood, if you like Israeli food. My favorite restaurant block in the city is E 20th, it’s a 10-15 min walk. There’s Nur, Gramercy Tavern, Sona, Barbounia, Rezdora, a Rotisserie place all on one block. If a ten minute walk is ok, I can give more suggestions. On the way to the ESB with a little detour, Five Guys might suit you for a burger. It\\'s on Madison Ave at 32nd St. Also, very close at 6th and 30th is L\\'Amico. Great pizzas and pasta. That goes without saying ;)\\nBTW, its a little off-topic but could lead to an interesting discussion but I think calling Shukette Israeli may raise an eyebrow or two. Gaonnuri is an upscale (but affordable) Korean somewhat hidden on the top floor of an office building on 32 st. near 6th Ave. on your way to ESB. Great views and good food. On another day you might like to try Upland, an easy walk southeast from your hotel. Burgers, salads, pizza, pasta etc.\\nhttps://uplandnyc.com/ Hill Country is excellent BBQ\\nilili is terrific Lebanese food Advice requested on which deck(s) to visit at night. Tickets for just 86th cheaper by $33 than doing the 86th and 102 combo. I am visiting in early October the night we fly in with my daughter. Walking over from the Courtyard by Marriott in Chelsea. Please advise as I\\'d like to purchase tickets in advance off the web site. What would I get for $66 more to do 102nd deck? A view from a slightly higher floor. If I recall correctly the 86th floor deck is much larger and is an outdoor deck with an enclosed space in the center. In May around sunset it was incredibly windy and cold. The 102nd floor deck is much smaller and entirely enclosed. I liked the view from the 86th floor better it just seemed closer. That was my thought exactly! This is super helpful thank you! This is a Youtube video about the 102nd Floor. Although it\\'s a small space, the windows are all floor to ceiling now. It\\'s been renovated for a few years. See if you think it\\'s worth it:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh1OPJ0Vwns\\nOne thing I don\\'t like about enclosed observatories is that the interior lights give a reflection on the window glass which means photos aren\\'t as clear as outdoors. You\\'ll notice that in the video. That might not bother you though. Instead of the Empire State Building, consider going to the Top of the Rock observatory in Rockefeller Center or The Edge observatory in Hudson Yards. They have much more room for visitors than ESB. Better views all around, too\\nESB often does a light show on its facades; you have it to be a distance away from the building to see it best, and the best view is the straight shot you get from Top of the Rock. As for The Edge, its glass floor protruding from the building will leave you dizzy looking straight down 1,000 feet or so to the street. Go to an observation deck in the late afternoon before dark to see NYC and stay until after sunset to see all the lights.\\nCheck the ESB light show calendar:\\nhttps://www.esbnyc.com/about/tower-lights/calendar\\nTop of the Rock:\\nhttps://www.rockefellercenter.com/attractions/top-of-the-rock-observation-deck/\\nThe Edge:\\nhttps://www.edgenyc.com/en Thanks for sharing the video. Helpful! Can\\'t wait to go. Thank you for your suggestions. My traveling companion was recently at Top of the Rock but I was unfamiliar about The Edge which looks amazing. From the web site it looks like we can eat down below after visiting the observation area. Do you know which restaurants may be more casual and offer traditional American fare options suitable for a teenager? I was thinking JIBS or Hudson Yards Grill. Any opinions welcome. Later this month, we will be arriving in NYC on a Thursday night and leaving Monday morning. We are a group of 8 including 4 adults and 4 kids ages 12-15 (all vaccinated). We love the theater and love food. Other than that, we’ve tried to plan a few cultural things and are skipping some of the more touristy attractions which we have already done (Circle Line Statue of Liberty, part of Central Park, the Met) or don’t really care about (Empire State Building, Top of the Rock). Here is our rough itinerary, things in bold have been booked already:\\nThursday:\\n3pm arrival at LGA\\nCheck-into The Knickerbocker\\n9pm dinner Korean BBQ at\\nFriday:\\nBreakfast: Russ & Daughters cafe (order on the way or before leaving hotel)\\n10:45am Tenement Museum Tour\\nChinatown\\nLunch: Dim Sum\\nToy Tokyo (one of the kids is a huge Anime fan)\\nNYU/Washington Square Park (one of the kids wants to go to NYU)\\n5:45pm dinner at The Harrow\\n8pm Wicked\\nSaturday:\\nBreakfast near hotel or MoMA\\n11am MoMA timed entry\\n2pm Little Shop of Horrors\\nChelsea Market (lunch/snack)\\nHigh Line\\nLittle Italy\\n8pm dinner at La Mela\\nSunday\\nEataly\\nNYSE/Charging bull\\n2pm 9/11 Memorial\\n5:30pm dinner at Buenavista\\n7:30pm Hadestown\\nMonday\\nLGA - flight home 12:30pm\\nAny suggestions are welcome, especially about logistical problems with the general timing or distance between activities.\\nWe need something to do the first night from about 5-9pm before dinner while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. Maybe Central Park, the Rooftop Bar at the Knickerbocker, walk around Times Square?\\nBest method of travel for a group of 8? We will try to walk as much as possible too. Can 4 people even fit in a regular Uber/Lyft? Are they still not allowing passengers in the front seat? Should we buy a subway pass? For the 1st night, I wouldn\\'t walk around Times Square as you\\'re both staying in the area & doing theater.\\nWould Grand Central Station be of interest? I admit to being at a loss other than that.\\nDefinitely look into a subway pass. I\\'m not an expert on them but check out the website of the MTA. What time are you planning to have lunch at the Chelsea Market? Our meal times are a little off this day. We will be eating something after the 2pm show to tide us over until our later dinner that night. So, around 4:30, not really lunch. The Knick is fantastic, you should love it. Request a room ending in 29 if you’re a light sleeper, those are in the back and much quieter. The rooms facing 42nd/Broadway have great views but can be a bit noisy. My wife and I were just there over the weekend for our anniversary, we go there all the time for breakfast and the rooftop bar. The Martini Suite is excellent but wasn’t available this weekend, we had one of the other suites. Definitely visit the St. Cloud rooftop bar, it’s our favorite in the city and there are few places I’d rather be on a summer evening. Even right now, it was very warm Saturday night but Friday was a bit chilly, it was very comfortable because they have heaters and blankets. The atmosphere, service and drinks are excellent. You may also want to have breakfast at the Knick one morning. They just reopened and aren’t doing the full menu yet (my wife loves the pancakes) but the buffet is actually very good. Ganja, Lisette and Rolando, who work the breakfast service, are lovely and will look after you very well. I would say all of the staff at the Knick are lovely, we’ve always had great service there. Tyra and Victoria at St. Cloud are great, I,dot know the hostess’ name but she’s very sweet and always gives us a great table. One more mention: if you like tacos, you should definitely try Los Tacos on W 43rd, just a short walk from the Knick. They are the best in the city and totally take me back to Mexico City. It gets very busy but moves fast. There’s also one in Chelsea Market, since you mentioned you’ll be there. Enjoy! Yes....use the subway. It is much easier than trying to coordinate travel/arrival times with 2 cars. I am visiting Oct 7 - 11 and for that timeframe the cheapest I can see is 269USD/ticket, on seatgeek/box office pricing for left/right orchestra. Is this pandemic pricing? I need 2 tickets and I can\\'t remember paying this much for any of the shows I\\'ve seen before and I believe Hamilton doesn\\'t even go for this much anymore. Do they release tickets in waves, trying to sell the most expensive first, am I better of waiting closer to the dates? I am a bit baffled. And can\\'t find any discount codes either :( I see lots of tix at SeatGeek (the official seller) for $199 each on the 7th, and a few for less money than that. Hamilton tickets go for much more. There are also very few bway discounts now. I expect that will change when more shows have opened. Yea I think people kinda had unreasonable expectations about what broadway tickets would cost. The popular shows are still popular. They don\\'t need to discount their prices. The difference is now you actually have a chance to buy the tickets where before sometimes it wasn\\'t even possible to find tickets. The less popular shows may have discounts when they open, but if the economics are not sustainable for those shows they would just close. Hadestown uses dynamic pricing, which means that when demand is high, prices will be higher. That also means they won\\'t discount. Instead, when dates aren\\'t selling well they reduce prices. (Back in September 2019, I was able to get an excellent orchestra aisle sest for $123 including fees, by buying a weeknight performance just 5 days in advance.)\\nUnfortunately for most of your dates, there are few tickets left, hence the high prices. The Thursday night performance is the only one with reasonable availability. IMO the $119 side mezzanine seats are good value - for this show there are advantages to the elevated view from the mezzanine. However if October 7 is your arrival date, it may be risky to buy tickets in advance because of possible travel delays. Thanks all for the feedback. We won\\'t be able to make the Oct 7 performance so I guess I will have to bite the bullet on this one . I guess we are lucky to even be able to see live entertainment during these times (and it is much needed and appreciated). The show will tour to Toronto in the next couple years. If the price in nyc doesn’t work for you, wait until it comes to you. Also, it seems like you are coming the Columbus Day weekend, which is typically a busy weekend and the beginning of the fall busy period (in a normal year there is often a lull between Labor Day and Columbus Day and a fair amount of discounting on Bway). I will be there Sept 20-25, will the TKTS booth be back up and running? Hadestown and Hamilton are the only open shows I haven\\'t already seen.I am sure Hamilton will be out of my price range, so Hadestown it is. I would be shocked if either of those shows were discounting at the TKTS booth or elsewhere in the next few days/weeks/months Hey! Please help NY\\'ers!\\nIm stuck between New York Palace or the Itinercontinental Barclays hotel? Can anyone recommend which one is better? Hoping to visit December 15th - 20th for 5 nights.\\nThanks! I don\\'t know which hotel is better but if you\\'re thinking of the Cathedral View rooms at the Palace that would be my choice. Plus they have a big Christmas tree in their front courtyard which adds to the Christmas vibe. I haven\\'t stayed at either, but the Palace is usually very festive at Christmas. Also note that though the Barclay is a very nice hotel, three other hotels close to it are currently closed, making for a rather gloomy stretch of Lexington Av. The Marriott Eastside and the Maxwell, across Lexington Av from it, have both closed for good and are awaiting new owners. The Waldorf Astoria, across E 49th St, is closed for an extensive gut renovation.\\nEdited: 12:55 am, September 22, 2021 Would you recommend any other hotels at christmas 5*? Well if you really want to splash out, some 5 star hotels that are also well located for NY Christmas activities like the tree at Rock Center include the St Regis, the Peninsula, the Plaza, the Pierre, the Marriott Essex House, the Mandarin Oriental. The last four also border the southern end of Central Park (the first two are about four blocks from the park, while the Palace is 9 or 10 blocks from the park, but closer to Rock Center than the others). There is also a Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South, near the Plaza and the Essex House. Thanks so much, you\\'re so helpful! If It was you, where would you choose? For a lovely room and good christmas spirit? Because I live here I have never stayed in any of them, though I have been in several (actually, I did spend a night in the Peninsula many years ago, but before it became the Peninsula and was known as the Gotham). The St Regis is THE original St Regis, home of a very famous bar and a NY classic, so I might be interested in staying there. But I think I might have a look at recent reviews for all of them, and also look at reviews for Christmas season 2019 to see how others experienced them during the festive season.\\nI wouldn\\'t rule out the Palace. Check the reviews. Although it is a modern 70s or 80s tower, it incorporates a group of beautiful historic townhouses that the hotel developers planned to demolish until the landmarks people said they couldn\\'t. We\\'re pretty much sold on \\'The Palace\\' due to how they dress it for Christmas, the only issue is apparently due to COVID, all their restaurants are closed, no minibars in room etc. But, if it gives the christmas spirit we don\\'t really mind as we wouldn\\'t eat in the restaurants in the hotel anyway.\\nIt\\'s such a hard choice! **all their restaurants are closed, no minibars in room etc. **\\nI really would not worry about that if spending Christmas in NYC. I would want to be out and about as much as possible. There is also a liquor store 5 min away from the hotel:\\nhttps://beekmanliquor.business.site\\nAlso, there are countless places to eat when visiting. And a large triptych painting over that St. Regis bar, \\'Old King Cole\\' by Maxfield Parrish.\\nEdited: 9:19 am, September 22, 2021 Me and my daughter, I\\'m in my 50\\'s she\\'s 30 are heading to New York next Feb, I\\'ve been before but her fist time.\\nWe have booked a package thru BA , staying at the Stewart Hotel, at time of booking the reviews were great but no they are quite bad.\\nI have the option to change the hotel\\nAnyone recommend some decent hotels, central to most attractions.\\nLast time i stayed we were a bit to far away from everything.\\nAlso my daughter is a crazy lover of shopping, you think its worth trying one of the out of town outlets.\\nWe are staying for 4 and 1/2 days 5 nights\\nMany thanks I can\\'t recommend a place to stay, but keep in mind that many hotels are operating with the same reduced services they adopted during the lockdown (some are said to see this reduction in service as a good way to increase profit). Many employees have been laid off and not called back to work.I can see how this might result in a lot of bad reviews (and the problem has been made worse in some cases by poor communication by hotels of these changes). If your daughter likes to shop you might want to try to stay in the same neighborhood to be close to Macy\\'s. That is also a very central neighborhood that is good for public transit. Whatever you do, make sure you check the hotel\\'s website for info on changes. I have heard of some hotels doing room cleaning only upon request made at least 24 hrs ahead. Some that say they include breakfast either have no breakfast or give you something in a bag. Many gyms/fitness rooms are closed. Room service has been suspended at hotels that offered it and some hotel restaurants closed. If there is anything that\\'s important to you, you need to confirm its status with the hotel.\\nI am not an expert on outlets, but have been told that a lot of the merchandise at them is not what you\\'d buy in a retail outlet, but special merch made for the outlet, like cheaper quality to go with cheaper prices. There are so many places to shop in NYC and so many deals to be had, I personally am not sure outlet shopping would be the best use of your time.\\nEdited: 4:36 am, September 25, 2021 Brilliant, thanks for that great insight, times have been so tough for the hospitality industry.\\nI agree with the outlet advice, I don\\'t really want to waste most of a day travelling to a outlet centre, she will definitely love Macys I am sure.\\nmany thanks again for your reply : ) Do you have just a few hotels to choose from for your package? I would be curious to know what they are, and if you have to pay extra. I think you can likely do much better than the Stewart. This is one of the downsides with packages imo. How much of the package is allocated to the hotel costs? Without knowing what the hotel budget is, suggestions are difficult.\\nWhere were too far out in terms of location for your last stay?\\n+1 for Mcwhippet\\'s questions.\\nDepending on what the daughter likes to shop, various areas might be great for this. I like areas where there are better food options than the area near Madison Square Garden where the Stewart is located, but that\\'s based on my travel preferences.\\nSoho, Union Square and Flatiron are all nice areas to look for hotels in and there are many good restaurants, quite a bit of shopping and subway stations in those areas.\\nFinancial District is an area where you sometimes can find bargains for good hotels. At least that\\'s been the case for me. Since the Manhattan island is narrower here, many hotels are near the subway hubs in the area (look at map before booking though) which easily can take you anywhere you need to be. And within walking distance you have some of the early history of the area as well, with some of the typical tourist attractions as well. It depends on your attraction list. Manhattan is a big island, attractions are all over, and in other boroughs as well. Staying near a subway station is key.\\nStart with your attraction list, that might narrow things down a bit, or not. BTW, your subject line says February 2021 and you posted your query in September 2021. Do you mean your trip is February 2022? >>Anyone recommend some decent hotels, central to most attractions.\\nLast time i stayed we were a bit to far away from everything.\\nAlso my daughter is a crazy lover of shopping, you think its worth trying one of the out of town outlets.<<\\nYes I agree please tell which hotels are available to you in your package.\\nI’m also curious as to where you stayed last time That you felt was too farout?\\nThat will help in getting proper recommendation for a new hotel as well.\\nYour outlet shopping question : with the amount of time you have in the city ,I would say no to the outlets ,there’s plenty of shopping to be done in The City.\\nEdited: 3:23 pm, September 25, 2021 Hi\\nMany thanks for your replies ....\\nWe have a list of 90 hotels to choose from in our BA package but am looking to keep within some sort of budget, I think we will probably choose one in the Times Square area ( which they have a lot of on their list )\\nAny recommendations here as the list is endless !!\\nThanks for pointing out i had put the wrong year on the thread.\\nAttractions on the list to name a few are\\nTop of the Rock\\nCentral Park\\nBrooklyn Bridge\\nStatue of Liberty\\n9/11\\nBroadway show\\nMy daughter also fancies doing a helicopter ride\\nLast time I stayed. it was not so much as far out from everything but a far walk to the areas we wanted to explore, the hotel was a Courtyard by Marriot one i think. Just a footnote.....\\nHere are some of the hotels recommended in our package\\nNew York Hilton midtown\\nDouble Tree by Hilton Times Sq south & west\\nArlo Midtown Times Sq\\nWyndham New Yorker\\nHotel Hendricks\\nM social hotel Times Sq\\nSheraton Times Sq\\nHotel 57\\nMillennium Hilton One Un Plaza\\nInside Melia NoMad\\nArlo NoMad\\nMoxy\\nGild hall A Thompson Hotel\\nMillennium Hotel Broadway, Times Sq My daughter has also booked a BA package in Feb staying at the Barclay Intercontinental. She stayed there on her last trip and loved it. N ot sure how it compares price wise but may be worth a look Hi everyone,\\nI have decided to live in New York during 30/40/50 days, from November to the end of December.\\nI don\\'t have any specific needs, in fact I work nimbly with my computer from home or from any bar/library.\\nI would just like to \"live New York\".\\nI had a look on the web and on old posts going back to 2013 and found some official pages that seem to make available rooms in shared apartments at prices ranging from $900 to $1500 per month (talking about Manhattan).\\nMy maximum budget (for rent) is just 1500 dollars.\\nHaving said that, I would like to ask if you consider such prices actually real or if they are scams.\\nI would also like to ask if you specifically suggest any pages where I can do research and book a room right away.\\nThank you very much!\\nRoberto ***I would just like to \"live New York\".***\\nThen you\\'re going to need a bigger budget.\\nOne suggestion though, think about quality over quantity. Why not come here for a shorter trip, stay in a legal hotel, and take in the city that way. Nobody is giving you an apartment in Manhattan for 1 month for $1500, they cost more than that when you lease, Month to month will cost more, It even costs more than that in Brooklyn and Queens Hi,\\nThanks for your answer!\\nWhat do you mean for \"a legal hotel\".\\nIt\\'s illegal rent a room during 40 days?\\nAnyway maybe I was not clear.\\nI\\'m not interested in a whole apartment, but just in a room.\\nThanks again! Look for private rooms on airBnB, look for ones with many reviews, and a rating of at least 4.5/5.0. You might find something, but likely for more $$$.\\nBut be very careful, avoid craigslist etc, they are even more difficult than airBnB can be.\\nPlus you must make sure you have good travel, medical, insurance.\\nEdited: 7:57 am, September 30, 2021 https://www.nyhabitat.com/ offers both monthly furnished rentals and monthly rentals with roommates. Upon checking there are accommodations within your budget. It will be up to you to do your research on the requirements for such rentals. As well as how reliable is a particular rental, the area it is located etc.\\nEdited: 8:15 am, September 30, 2021 Great! Thanks both, Although Airbnb and nyhabitat were exactly the two pages I was checking.\\nAirbnb seems a bit more expensive though I suppose there is the advantage of the platform as a guarantor to avoid scams.\\nHowever can someone confirm that Airbnb is illegal only for renting whole apartments (without the presence of the owner) for less than 30 days. Have I understood correctly?\\nThanks again! Most AirBnB Style short term apartment rentals are illegal in all five boroughs of NYC\\nThey are illegal in any residential building with three or more units. The only potentially legal ones are in one or two family houses - which are uncommon in areas that are desirable or convenient for visitors https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/articles/liz-krueger/answers-new-yorkers-concerned-or-confused-about-illegal-hotel-law and https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/about-illegal-short-term-rentals.page\\nThe source of the offer does not matter - the legal classification of the building does. **No internet middleman, even otherwise respectable or well known ones, vets listings for compliance with local laws**, leaving visitors vulnerable.\\nThe spare room rental situation is different - but not uncomplicated https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/information-for-hosts.page #7 is regarding the illegal hotel law\\nAn apartment rental tenant or condo/coop owner may not have the legal right to rent under the terms of their lease or ownership agreements without landlord or board approval Thank you!!!\\nI read with much interest the articles you shared! You have been enlightening.\\nIn my case I don\\'t fall into any of the illegal situations described:\\nI am making contact exclusively with people who rent rooms without locks in their apartment for more than 30 days :) Roberto, I understood exactly what you stated in your post. You want a room, not an entire apartment.\\nMy understanding is that a room in a shared apartment is perfectly legal. I don\\'t know what the going rate is but I imagine you could find something decent for $1500/mo.\\nMy advice is to vet the roommate(s) well. Communicate by phone, not just email. Make sure there will be compatability and that the apartment rules and limitations are well understood. One month isn\\'t forever but you want to have a comfortable, safe, and enjoyable visit.\\nThink about neighborhoods and what your goals are during your stay.\\nI wish you a wonderful visit! In the \"mega\" airport category, JFK is 2nd best after 1st place Miami, and Newark is 5th from the bottom. Of \"large\" airports, LaGuardia is the second worst just above the lowest ranking airport in the entire survey, Philadelphia\\nhttps://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2021-north-america-airport-satisfaction-study Yay!! Glad the airport I chose has good service. :) LaGuardia ranked last of major US aiports?\\nAnd the Sun rose this morning Are you sure that\\'s not a typo and JFK isn\\'t ranked second WORST after Miami? LaGuardia was a nightmare for years. My grandmother passed away in November 2016 (week before Thanksgiving). I left my home on Long Island at 1pm to pick up my brother at 2:30pm. The parking garages were torn down, traffic was horrific, and I circled the terminal 5 or 6 times. I met with my brother around 4:45pm near a cargo building. It took all day to get my brother and prepare for a funeral the next day.\\nThings are better today but that day always sticks out in my mind. The only rating that matters is the experience that one has at a particular airport. The survey is complete nonsense. JFK terminal 7 is a complete dump. Hello oh wise ones!\\nI\\'d really appreciate some advice on my itinerary. My partner and I will hopefully be visiting from the UK on 17 December and flying home 21st. We\\'ve both been to New York before so no have already done many of the tourist sites. We are staying at the Moxy Times Square.\\nDay 1 - our flight doesn\\'t land until 8pm so no plan other than to go straight to the hotel using the LIRR, maybe get some food locally, depending on the time.\\nDay 2 (Saturday) - starting the day in Hudson Yards and then walk the High Line, check out Chelsea Market and then head to to Greenwich to explore.\\nMid afternoon take subway to Grand Central Station as we have 4pm reservations for the Summit One Vandebilt\\nEvening: head over to LES, we both love live music so was thinking about Rockwood Music Hall or Arlenes Grocery.\\nDay 3 (Sunday) - Head over to Brooklyn, eitber taking the ferry to Dumbo or walking over the Brooklyn Bridge.\\nHave a wander around Brooklyn heights before heading to the Timeout Market for lunch.\\nPM - explore Dumbo, watch the sunset in Brooklyn Bridge Park.\\nHead to Deiker Heights to check out the houses.\\nEvening - dinner back in Manhatten, OH wants to eat at Cote so was considering making a reservation for around 9pm to allow us time to get back from Brooklyn and freshen up before heading out again.\\nDay 4 (Monday) more of a relaxed day, mainly Shopping, Christmas windows and Bryant Park Christmas market.\\nEvening - we have tickets for Billy Joel at MSG.\\nDay 5 (Tuesday) Get breakfast. Check out and then head to Central Park, spend the morning in tbe Park before picking up any last minute shopping on the walk back to hotel to collect bags and head to airport (- flight is at 6.30)\\nWith your exopert eyes how does this look.? Would also welcome any recommendations of places to eat in LES, (we love food so all cuisines and budgets considered!)yor alternatives for live music places, bars close by to MSG that we could go after Billy JJoel and anywhere nice for drinks before or after Cote\\nThank you in advance! Sounds busy! And potentially very cold with all those outdoor activities. Well organized by locations, though. It looks like a good itinerary. Some additional Christmas time suggestions which probably can fit into your itinerary (I have lived near New York my whole life).\\nStop in Macy’s Department Store at 34th between 6th and 7th. Very fun place to go during Christmas season. Ride the escalators up and down.\\nGo to Rockefeller Center and see the Christmas Tree and Ice Skating Rink.\\nWalk on Fifth Avenue in the evening and watch the light and music show at Saks Fifth Avenue and then visit Saint Patrick’s Cathedral.\\nGo in Central Park near 59th and 5th. Stop in the Plaza Hotel first to warm up and across the street at the GM Building go underground to the USA’s largest Apple Store.\\nBring your proof of vaccination or forget your whole trip.\\nHave a great trip. More suggestions later. The thing I hate about the Forum is that you can’t toggle back and forth to the post as you write a reply. Other than that it is great.\\nI would walk over the Brooklyn Bridge. That is a unique experience. If you want something interesting then get to Flatbush Avenue and try the Cheesecake at Junior’s. Brooklyn Heights promenade and the view of Manhattan is worthwhile. I would get back to Manhattan earlier and forget the park and sunset. That is a summertime activity.\\nMaybe go to the Brooklyn Bridge and Brooklyn as early in the morning as possible so you get back to Manhattan by lunch time. Then at Grand Central Station you can go to the lower level and have a quick lunch at the Oyster Bar at Grand Central. Sit at the counter which is faster. If you want to save money then just order a bowl of New England Clam Chowder with some rolls or crackers. The Oyster Bar is a unique New York experience.\\nI am going to have to reread your post for some more ideas and comments because I can’t toggle to it. My last round of ideas and comments.\\nYou do not include Wall Street and downtown in you itinerary. Visit the 9/11 Memorial and possibly the 9/11 Museum. Go inside the new World Trade Center complex and the Oculus and shops. Eataly is an Italian place with good food located inside the World Trade Center complex and a unique experience. You can eat there or get food for take out (UK = take away). Then you could walk to Trinity Church and see Alexander Hamilton’s grave, walk on Wall Street to see New York Stock Exchange, walk to Battery Park to see Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island from a distance.\\nResearch the Immersive Van Gogh exhibit on the East River. It is expensive but worthwhile. Then you can walk along the East River under the Manhattan Bridge and Brooklyn Bridge to the South Street Seaport and Wall Street.\\nLittle Italy and Chinatown are very busy during Christmas.\\nI have done all these things and much much more.\\nGood luck with your planning. One last thing. Go to TKTS at Times Square at 11 am to see what Broadway shows you can buy tickets to at 50 percent off or better. Do not count on finding desirable last minute Broadway tickets during Christmas week. If you want to see a show, book it in advance. +1 not waiting to get Broadway tickets unless you are very non-particular about what you see. Discounts tend to vanish during the holidays, If you must buy discounted tickets, do it online on Playbill or TheaterMania as you can buy a month or so before & have a better selection of shows & seats. Your Sunday seems very light, aimless, and cold to me. Maybe head to the Brooklyn museum in the morning and then stop off in Brooklyn heights etc and condense those walking plans by a few hours? Post #6 and Post #7 may be correct. Save my Post #5 suggestion for a future trip weekday not during a holiday. There is another TKTS at South Street Seaport which is less busy. You can always stop and read the board for 2 minutes and see what is offered. Anything is possible. That may be a tough time for Broadway discounts - in general since re-opening I\\'m finding discounts tougher to come by. I thought that the South Street Seaport tkts location may have closed as it is no longer listed on the tdf website.\\nhttps://tdf.org/nyc/8/Locations-Hours So I have some friends coming into the city this wknd and they are asking where they can get a good burger.\\nI will take them to LI Bar on Atlantic Bar(near my casa) during their visit.\\nPlease recommend me some other spots for a good burger. They are not the fancy $65 burger crowd. They are just looking for a laid back place with a good cheeseburger/fries and some drinks.\\nThey will \"venture\" into the city every day so any recs will be helpful.\\nThanks in advance..... Forgive me if this is obvious but Shake Shack & Minetta Tavern. I thought 5 Napkin Burger was very good. I’ve never not had a hot juicy burger at Paul\\'s da Burger joint .\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5929105-Reviews-Paul_s_Da_Burger_Joint-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nEdited: 11:41 am, September 03, 2021 I recently had a burger at Black Tap, but it was overseas. I see they have a few locations in NYC. The burger I had was really really good, so I will likely try their NYC locations. JG Melon has great burgers along with P.J. Clarke. Shake shack is alright but its an international chain and I have had many better burgers in NYC. Shake shack is more of a convenience thing where if I want something better than mcdonalds but still want take away. It is definitely a solid burger but not something I recommend to visitors unless they simply don\\'t have them where they live and never had them where they travelled. Kinda like when I go out west I will go to in-n-out burger. Not the best burger in the world but definitely still good and worth the experience of trying\\nEdited: 12:08 pm, September 03, 2021 When reading the title of the thread, my first thought was Minetta Tavern. I generally like the Keith Mcnally restaurants (my preference obviously shines through here), but when reading the not fancy expensive burger crowd I ruled that one out.\\nFor a laid back place with a burger and simply hang out, my take - again my preferences - would be someplace at a local non-chain diner type place. That\\'s the type of place where someone like me would love to hang out for a bit when not going to a fancy place nor wanting to break the bank. I\\'d say there are many places so finding one near where you\\'ll want to spend the rest of the evening would be the key factor so I won\\'t name names.\\nAnd now for the suggestion where I don\\'t have much input on specific places, since these aren\\'t really my cup of tea most of the time, at least not in NYC: An Irish pub. Plenty all around town, would perhaps fit if you like beer with the burgers.\\nDo you like sportsbar type places? Mudville 9. Been dropping in for a beer and something to eat when I\\'ve stayed nearby. Can\\'t recall what I had, but it worked well for what it was. They have a bunch of burger options, I think my friend might have had one when we were there. Very good beer list. And an institution in the area.\\nhttps://mudville9.com/#eluid301682de Park Slope Ale House is good - not go-way-out-of-your-way good, but a nice stop if they want to hang in Park Slope.\\nKorzo in the south slope is another favorite - if they want to try something a little different, this is (maybe) worth a detour. They stuff their burgers inside Hungarian fried bread for extra goodness (sounds heavy & greasy but it’s not). Beer is good there, too. What is hungarian fried bread like? I love a cheesy cheeseburger. This list puts Jolene, relatively new and one I haven\\'t yet tried, at the top. It also lisst your place and a few I like.\\nhttps://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/best-burgers-nyc #7: it’s a fried, somewhat puffy flatbread…Native American “fry bread” comes close, if you’ve ever had that. Or even South Asian puri (except thicker, with more chew).\\nHere’s a wiki description:\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lángos When we want the absolute, hands-down, BEST bacon cheeseburger in a NYC we go to (drum beat)…….THE CORNER BISTRO.....located in The Village at the corner of West 4th and Jane Streets. For more information, see:\\nhttp://cornerbistrony.com\\nCH Need to buy a couple baby gifts when we are there on our upcoming trip. Like to support independent shops, so prefer no chains. We can Uber elsewhere in Manhattan if you know of a really nice one. Thanks! https://anmeshop.com/\\nTake note of their hours. They open late. Actually I don\\'t think there are many chain baby boutiques, at least not in Manhattan. With the exception of a couple of very high end places that are part of French chains and are mostly on Upper East Side or Upper West Side, I think most such shops here are independently owned. We went to An Me and bought the gifts. Such a cute shop! And it was only a couple blocks from my favorite bakery and favorite bagel place. Thank you for the recommendation! Glad it worked for you.☺️👍🏻 If we have a 9am security check-in for the ferry leaving Battery Park (with pedestal tour), will we be able to do both islands justice and still be able to get back to our midtown hotel by 5pm? We plan to use the subway to/from Battery Park. The pedestal tours don\\'t run on weekends, and the one day we can get morning pedestal tickets is the one where we have evening plans. We are the ones that like to spend time reading museum exhibits, but we can be a bit quicker if we must. What time would we need to catch the ferry back to Battery Park to be at our midtown hotel by 5pm? TIA! Yes, definitely enough time. You\\'ll probably only need 3-4 hours for both islands, maybe 5 hours at the most if you like to linger and read.\\nYou would even have time to get back to Battery Park and have a look at some sights there before heading back to the hotel by 5.00pm. If you\\'re staying in Midtown, allow half an hour for the subway ride from the Battery Park / Financial District area, plus any walking to get to the station. Agreed, 3 hours is probably about right, more or less depending on interest. We went to SoL and Ellis Island on one of our trips. We left Battery Park at about 9am and returned by 4pm. We visited the Pedestal - it was when the Museum was in the Pedestal and we also looked at two of the Ellis Island Museum exhibitions thoroughly and did the 90 minute Hard Hat tour there. I found my entry in that visit\\'s Trip Report, so I will copy and paste it here for you to give you some ideas....\\n-----------------------------\\nWe were on the 9.10 ferry to Liberty Island, we loved the Museum in the Pedestal and the views. Crowds were pretty big - be prepared to be patient, especially at the crowded outside viewing area where everyone wants a photo of the Financial District. We didn\\'t do a walk around the Reserve, and we had an audio guide, but didn\\'t use it. I used it on our visit in 2008 and it\\'s great. Doing it might mean you spend longer at Liberty Island. Just a note, when we arrived at Liberty Island at 9.20 there were a few people lining up to get back on the ferry. Given the first ferry doesn\\'t leave Battery Park till 8.30am, they only spent half an hour or so on Liberty Island - so if you\\'re in a rush it is doable (I\\'d do a boat-by the Island on a Water Taxi or a cruise with Circle Line Cruises if I was that rushed.)\\nWe were on the 11am ferry to Ellis Island. We checked in immediately with the Save Ellis Island group and we\\'re able to swap from the 1.30 Hard Hat tour to the 12.30 one because the latter wasn\\'t full. Spent the intervening time visiting the \\'Through America\\'s Gates\\' part of the Ellis Island Museum. That is so interesting. Don\\'t miss it if you have tickets for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Of the 20 million who went through Ellis Island, 1% were sent back to their country of origin for legal reasons and another 1% were sent back for medical reasons. The exhibition is so well done. We saw it in 2008 and are very glad we\\'ve finally been able to see it again.\\nThen on to the Hard Hat tour....if you\\'re interested in history, architecture or medicine do this tour. It was amazing. Fred took us through the hospital, mostly the Contagious Diseases Wards as the Hospital Buildings are still dilapidated after 60 years of no use and maintenance.\\nEDiT - oh, And and I did see ART today...on the HH tour there are great stencils on some walls and windows .... by an artist called JR. Google them...they are beautiful - the Ghosts of Ellis Island.\\nAfter the 90 minute tour, we had a break and some lunch....take your own food...put it in the locker at the Statue of Liberty if you have Pedestal or Crown tickets - no food is allowed, and the only drink allowed is water.\\nAfter half an hour we returned to the Museum and looked at the exhibition called \\'Peak Immigration Years\\' (1880 - 1925)...very well done....great photos, but a lot to read too.\\nWe had about 15 minutes in another exhibition - Immigration Now exhibition (1945 - present) but it was too noisy in there with tele screens of people\\'s stories, so it was hard to focus on reading, so we headed off for the 3.10 ferry, missed that and caught the 3.30 one and back at Battery Park a little before 4pm (it takes ages to disembark if you\\'re outside up the top looking at the view...just stay and look at the view for longer). I have a 24 hours layover in NYC and it\\'s the first time I\\'ll visit there, can you guys please guide me what places should I visit and in what order to save time.\\nI\\'ll land at JFK at 5pm and planning to take air train and then subway to reach Manhattan. I\\'ll be alone and planning to drop luggage at store.\\nI am not into Museums kind of places, but would love to visit places like Manhattan bridge, Statue of Liberty, One World observatory (Not sure if I should go for the other one Rockefeller Center or not), Time Square and Vessel.\\nAlso, if you guys could advise on what are the cheapest option to spend few hours to rest and fresh up? I suggest getting a hotel in Manhattan, dropping off your luggage, going out and enjoying the evening. In the morning, check out, leaving your luggage at the hotel, then make plans for the Statue of Liberty, ticket required and purchased in advance. This is approximately a 3 hour excursion when you factor in Ellis Island as well. This woud be my suggestion, Take the Subway downtown to Battery park and take the Staten Island Ferry, you can see the lower Manhattan Skyline and the Statue of Liberty . Then get on the 1 train at Battery Park to Times Square\\nSee times square and then walk to 6th Ave up to 50th St and Rockefeller Center and do top of the Rock, See top of the rock (probably the best of the Observatories), After top of the rock, go to 5th Ave and walk up 5th Ave to Central Park, walk down central park to the Central Mall, The famous fountain and Bow bridge are there. If you still have time walk to Lexington Ave and take the downtown train to City Hall, the Brooklyn Bridge is there and you can walk across the Brooklyn Bridge Travelling with my mum from the UK mid December (hopefully, covid dramas permitting). I’ve always wanted to see the Dyker Heights lights and she would love it.\\nThe tours seem a bit pricey and have mixed reviews. I’m confident travelling and organising things by myself so is there a reason why we shouldn’t.. I presume the area is safe enough? I know it’s a mile from the subway which we’re both comfortable to walk, and there are maps online we can follow to see the best houses etc.\\nJust wanted to check if there was any reason a tour would be preferable? The only plus I can see is you don’t have to sort out your own transport which I kind of enjoy anyway, and you maybe get a bit of history about it all which we’re not too fussed on.\\nEspecially with the covid situation and the UK still have high cases, I feel doing it DIY is one less thing we have to book and worry about should everything need to be called off.\\nReally excited to hopefully be back state side after several years! Me and my mum last visited New York together in May time so I’m much looking forward to showing her all the sights when it’s festive. If anyone can chime in on whether the Rockettes show is worth seeing for getting in the festive spirit too it would be a bonus!\\nThank you! Very easy to do on your own. It\\'s basically visiting another NYC neighborhood and taking a route that you choose when you arrive. It involved about 1-2 Miles of walking in a residential neighborood. Its a very safe neighborhood This is what I hoped to hear thank you. I assumed it was a safe neighbourhood given how lovely the houses are. We’ll make an evening of it by ourselves in that case. Thanks so much! This might help you decide https://freetoursbyfoot.com/dyker-heights-christmas-lights/\\nThe buses aren\\'t allowed on the residential streets where the displays are - you get out and walk. There is one guided tour where you meet the guide in the neighborhood\\nI\\'m not sure how much being guided would enhance the experience Yes, very easy to do it on your own. I did and liked being able to pace it according to my own schedule. There are several ways of getting there by subway depending on where you\\'re starting from. Can be combined with a local bus too for some options.\\nDon\\'t know how much has changed because of the pandemic, but before that some of the main routes for decorations were on 11th Avenue to 13th Avenue and from 83rd to 86th Street in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn.\\nI took the R subway train to 86 street in Brooklyn and connected to a B1 bus there to get closer to the area. This worked out well for me since I stayed near a subway station for the R in Manhattan. But look at Google maps and you can see some other subway stations near-ish Dyker Heights as well. The guide IMO will help you from getting lost, this is not really an area you can ask for help getting around like Manhattan Thank you - I will likely download google maps offline to my phone ahead and i\\'m generally pretty good with directions!\\nWe\\'re staying at Citizen M times square so nice and central, just need to check the closest subway line. We enjoy walking though. Hopefully i\\'ll get better weather than my last December visit which was rain the entire time! I live in Dyker Heights. It\\'s so achingly safe that it\\'s downright boring. I can see little reason why a guided tour would be necessary. You\\'re just looking at houses from public sidewalks. There is little danger of getting lost. The streets and avenues are nearly all numbered on a Manhattan-like rectangular grid. For food and drink before or after, 3rd Avenue in Bay Ridge offers many great options. I\\'ve done the R train and B1 bus combo. It was easy, and when I got on the bus I asked the driver to alert me when we got to the lights area and they were happy to do so. It must be a well known area. It was a snowy night as well which made eveything look even more special.\\nThe other subway option that you could do is the D train. But you would have to walk around 20 mins to the lights area.\\nFrom the CitizenM the D train might work the best for you because you won\\'t need to change trains. Go to the 7th Ave station in Manhattan and allow around an hour and 15 mins to get to the lights.\\nTake a look at google maps and put in an estimated time to leave and you\\'ll see the options.\\nEdited: 6:04 pm, September 29, 2021 I don’t live in Dyker Heights, but agree with #8! In addition to the suggestion of 3rd Av for restaurants/bars after, you’ll find a ton of choices on 4th and 5th Av’s. Karam - on 4th Av across the street from the 86th St R stop - is a good choice for Lebanese food…pretty sure that’s where I went after my last lights excursion. I`m clueless. Looking for advice on everything ! Looking to stay late February , flexible with amount of days and budgeting 200 euros a night or accommodation. Looking to stick to tourist things and ideally a show and shopping. Any advice re accommodation etc is very much appreciated . Prices really do vary by date, if you can post approx dates, the number of beds you need and budget in USD the hotel experts will be along to help Also, ask the tweens to do some online research or purchase a travel book(buy one with a recent published date) and have them pick out what they would be interested in doing/seeing.\\nIt is difficult to suggest what would be appropriate not knowing anything about your family.\\nSporting event? They may not be interested.\\nIce skating? Maybe they are.\\nLego store? Maybe they aren\\'t into that.\\nSneaker shopping? Maybe they are.\\nProvide a lot more details for better responses. For first timers I would advise staying somewhere in Midtown where lots of attractions are reasonably close together and within walking distance. Don\\'t stay on 7th Ave in Times Square, it\\'s too crowded and noisy at times. **Don\\'t stay on 7th Ave in Times Square, it\\'s too crowded and noisy at times.**\\nBut the OP/family may be from a small town that doesn\\'t have anything like Times Sq and love that area.\\nNeed much more info..... My advice is to install a travel app on your phone such a Citymapper. Use it when researching hotels to see if they’re convenient to what you want to do.\\nI would start in Manhattan. Using the subway ,city buses, cabs and walking will get you to where you need to be. Times Square area is a fine place to (briefly) visit, for us, but would never want to stay there or any area adjacent to Penn Station (personal preference). I would go closer to Central Park if you are using Times Square as your guidepost. I think something handy is to pull up google maps and turn on the street level view and \"walk\" around the prospective hotels. Is that what you\\'re looking for vibe wise? Are there good shops and restaurants? Close to the subway? You don\\'t need to be close to any specific attraction if you are close to the subway. The main tourist attractions are scattered all over so there is no one central spot to stay.\\nOn 2 separate kids, both of my tweens hated Times Square and couldn\\'t wait to get out of that area. It would have been challenging if our hotel had been there. And they are city kids but TS overwhelmed them.\\nEdited: 11:42 am, October 01, 2021 >I think something handy is to pull up google maps and turn on the street level view and \"walk\" around the prospective hotels. Is that what you\\'re looking for vibe wise? Are there good shops and restaurants? Close to the subway?<<<\\nI agree. After I use my Citymapper transportation app to understand if my hotel is conveniently located . Done by doing sample trips to where I want to go and understanding what mode of transportation works.\\nI go on google Street View and “walk around “ hotel locales.\\nI do this for All perspective hotels. Especially done when I was a newcomer to New York City.\\nAdditionally on Google you can use the “ search nearby “ method for restaurants for any hotel. What age is a tween these days? Around 12? Am I correct in assuming they will both be fully vaccinated by then? Kids are 10,12 . 12 year old fully vaccinated 10 year old is not as not available in Ireland yet . Thanks for reply . Dates are 4 nights anytime from feb 19th to 25th 2022. Budget approx 250 usd a night for 4 beds . Have a few questions ahead of our (hopeful) trip mid December!\\nI’ve stayed in a few Citizen M’s in Europe but only solo.. I know they are compact rooms, but will they have storage for two full sized suitcases?\\nCan anyone comment on the area of the hotel.. it looks like it’s on the edge of Times Square towards Colombus Circle which should be well placed for the Christmas market there if it’s still there this year..\\nAs we’ll be jet lagged my mum and I have a tradition of eating at a 24/7 or early opening diner or similar. I can see the Times diner & grill may fit the bill but if anyone can recommend any other options that would be great, it doesn’t have to be diner food, just something that’s likely to be open around 5am!\\nAnd any other recommendations for food or just sees nearby would be much appreciated! Scared to enter full planning mode in case the trip doesn’t happen but not sure I can help myself :-)\\nThank you! You\\'re right about the location, it\\'s not far from Columbus Circle and the southern edge of Central Park. Around a 10 minute walk from the hotel.\\nPick-a-Bagel opens at 6.00am. That\\'s on 8th Ave/53rd St.\\nFor general eating, Toloache for Mexican is close. Bibble and Sip is good for coffee and pastries. Don Antonio for pizza. Ippudo for ramen. There are lots of places to eat on 9th Ave too, just head there and see what looks good. Here\\'s a video of a walk thru of the rooms. For a split second as he enters the room there seems to be a space as you enter for luggage, but whether it will hold 2 cases Idk. There\\'s storage drawers under the bed, but not sure a suitcase will fit.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKkzOjkk0jE&t=312s\\nAre you sure this room setup is going to work for you and Mum?\\nThe area is fine though.\\nEdited: 9:19 pm, October 02, 2021 There are lots of reviews of the property on TA. More than a few comment that the hotel is a good option for single travelers.\\nThere are mentions of some type of drawer under the bed to store “ a” suitcase.\\nThe rooms are all the same size. 150 square feet. Even by NYC hotel standards that’s not a lot of space for two people for multiple days IMO.\\nEdited: 9:31 pm, October 02, 2021 Thank you all for the responses. I have been wondering the same thing. I booked it because I could get 7 nights for $1835 which seemed reasonable and the area looked central. Thought it might be a cute quirky place to take my mum, but knowing it’ll be a bit cold I wonder if we’re better off with more space.\\nI am going to have another look on booking.com but if anyone can recommend any other places in a similar area (or somewhere central for a festive atmosphere for under $2000 for 7 nights I’d be interested to know.\\nOn our last trip we stayed at Four Points by Sheraton in Chelsea area and keen to be somewhere a bit more lively and festive this time around.\\nThanks for the help! Rates fluctuate by date. When are you coming? Sorry that wasn’t helpful was it! We will hopefully be landing on the 11th and have a late return flight on the 18th.\\nI’ll see what else is around.. good bonus of the rooms being refundable! booking.com shows square footage of rooms, Not for every single one, but for most. This is true at least on the American version of the site. Thank you I will look into that. It’s still coming up as the nicest central option without massively upping our budget. Me and my mum are comfortable being in close quarters so as long as we can squeeze the luggage in we should be fine. we have a limited time visiting NYC. (2 adults, 1 teen, and 2 20-somethings)\\nThinking a night-time bus tour seeing lots of the sites might be fun. (or other suggestions for a friday or sunday Night?)\\nWe\\'ve done them before in DC (monuments - WONDERFUL!) and Chicago. Just wondering if anyone thinks they are worthwhile in NYC. thanks for thoughts!\\nalso vax cards. The app - can people from out of state download and use it? Can a real card be used instead? (can\\'t use the app on my outdated phone it seems). The Excelsior pass can only be used by those vaccinated in NYS but there are alternatives https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page We did a night bus tour in 2019 on our arrival evening. We also had a pretty short time to visit. Highly recommend. It was me and my then-15 year old daughter. We felt it was a great way to see a lot of the buildings, bridges and locations. The tour guide was super knowledgeable, a life long New Yorker who had many great stories and pointed out so many interesting sights. It was a great overview and a fantastic way to start off our trip. Hi all,\\nFirstly I apologise if these questions are asked frequently, I am on my mobile so can’t see the FAQ’s.\\nI have also tried google but not getting very far so I hope my fellow travellers/locals can help.\\nFingers crossed we will be able to visit again providing the US give a reopening date soon, I have flights booked flying to Orlando, spending 10 days then to NYC on the 24 Nov to spend Thanksgiving in the City before flying back to London on the Saturday evening.\\nSo I have a few questions…\\nTo get a decent view of the parade I understand you will need to be on the street around 4/5 in the morning, we will be staying around the Times Square area, so can only guess that the streets around there will fill up first and fast. Am I best to head up to Central Park West or is the whole route just as busy that early in the morning.\\nThanksgiving dinner, I have done some research, but there is not a great deal for 2021 when googleing. I have looked on opentable and seen loads of restaurants available but when I look direct there is no mention of a Thanksgiving meal/menu on the restaurants website. So are there any recommendations? We are not one for fancy/pretentious restaurants and hotels, and would prefer something more authentic.\\nThese are my main questions at the moment, but if anyone has any other wisdom to impart on a Thanksgiving newbie that would be amazing!\\nI just hope we get to come and share this amazing time with you! Hi Andy. I was in New York for Thanksgiving in 2016 and went to the parade. Here’s a bit of our experience:\\nWe had a late night before the parade, so despite wanting to be there for 6:30-ish, we didn’t make it until about 8 am or so. I thought we wouldn’t see anything, but I thought we still had a pretty decent view, considering. We were behind a few rows of people, but could still see floats and marching bands, and the balloons are so massive, you can’t miss them. I have some photos linked in a trip report. I will see if I can find them.\\nI would take the subway up to Central Park West. That’s where we were, and I think you would have a better experience. Again, I will check my trip report, but I think we were at 72nd Street. I didn’t find the trains overly crowded at all, but part of that may have been us arriving later.\\nI really think arriving at 4 or 5 am is not necessary. I think you would be perfectly fine with 6 or 6:30 for a really good spot. Just my opinion.\\nFor dinner, OpenTable will have a devoted Thanksgiving page, but when I checked ten days ago or so, it wasn’t up and running yet. Within a couple of weeks it will be. I think it’s still a bit too early to see menus on websites. Some will post or link them right to that OpenTable. A lot of places won’t be taking reservations more than 30 days out. Also, be prepared that you may need to give a credit card authorization at some places to hold your reservation.\\nWe ended up at Cookshop for our dinner. We loved it and I think it would suit you quite well, but there are tons of places for a low-key dinner. I am thinking The Smith would work. They have four locations and Jacob’s Pickle would be good, but I think they would fill up really quickly. Just found my trip report. Unfortunately, the link to the photos doesn’t work any more. A couple of changes to my post above. I say in the report that the subway was “jammed”. I don’t remember that. And we stood just north of 70th Street, not 72nd. (Same difference, I’m sure.) You should be able to see the FAQs by scrolling to the right hand side of the screen & magnifying quite a bit.\\nYou are too early to see Thanksgiving. Reservations open about a month ahdead/ Okay, I was able to put some photos together from the trip in imgur. I haven’t used it before, so hopefully it works. The parade photos are from a 7:45-ish arrival, so you will see I have people ahead of me, but still a bit of a view.\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Fm27Vez Thank you, your pictures look great and certainly had a half decent view considering the time you arrived. https://vegemite.com.au/australia-youre-doing-it-wrong/\\nhttps://rosaspizzanyc.com/\\nSo, Rosas Pizza in Williamsburg reckons the Aussies have been eating Vegemite wrong for 97 years by spreading it on toast. Giovanni says it\\'s better on pizza!\\nI can kinda agree with him because for those that don\\'t know what Vegemite is, it\\'s a savoury, salty, black, sticky, very umami flavoured spread. It\\'s sometimes used in stocks to add a flavour profile similar to a beef stock, but for most Aussies we just spread it on toast as a breakfast item.\\nAnd you never spread it thick like peanut butter unless you want a heart attack. The thinner you can spread it, the better, just for a hint of umami.\\nAdd sliced cheese on top and grill / broil it and it\\'s an added bonus.\\nSo cheese pizza with a Vegemite spread would be yum and Giovanni could be onto something there! Sorry, but no. I’m an adventurous eater - no problem w offal, slimy sea creatures, grasshoppers - but one must draw the line somewhere, and I personally draw it at vegemite pizza. 😉 Have you tried Vegemite, Linda?\\nI actually draw the line at offal, grasshoppers etc so I\\'m opposite to you. Vegemite is a walk in the park if it\\'s a thin spread. Too thick and it\\'s yuck. I’m pretty sure I’ve had vegemite (an ex lives in Sydney & I visited him there many years ago). I’ve definitely had Marmite, which I think of - maybe wrongly? - as similar.\\nAnd you should try chapulines (grasshoppers) -they’re delicious! Thank you for this Aynat.\\nI\\'ll give them three weeks To be fully Australian, don’t they need to put pineapple, beetroot & a fried egg on it? Yes, Marmite is similar to Vegemite.\\nPineapple on pizza....yuck.\\nBeetroot on burgers.....yum.\\nFried egg on anything.....yum.\\nI tend to think the Vegemite trend won\\'t last. It\\'s too different even though it\\'s a savoury spread. New Yorkers just ain\\'t ready for it! Ive never gotten a gift with so many instructions on how to eat it. \"...and if you still dont like it, try it this way...\" - repeated 7 times\\nI still keep it in case I\\'ll need to build a bunker Haha, some say you could also use it for axle grease.\\nGuess what I just had for my breakfast? Wholemeal toast with butter, Vegemite and a fried egg on top! Delicious. I rather eat pizza with pineapple. For breakfast Isn\\'t it also something, or a type of thing, they give people in hard times/famine to prevent starvation? Sort of like spam? Slept in on Monday, it was our Anniversary and we went exploring. Two blocks East of our hotel was Grand Central Station. Just stunning, the history in that building. Figured out the subway, got our passes and got on the #4 to Wall Street. Came up from the station in front of Trinity Church and was disappointed to discover that it\\'s closed, including the cemetery, due to Covid. We walked around the block though and saw many of the headstones from the 1700\\'s and got a good picture of Alexander Hamiltons grave, unfortunately Eliza\\'s is ground level and you can\\'t see it from the sidewalk. We walked the Wall St. area stopping at Federal Hall and the NYSE. From there we headed to the 9/11 memorial. We walked around taking it all in, I took no photos, it didn\\'t feel right. We didn\\'t go into the museum, I don\\'t know if I ever will be able to. From there we went back on the subway to head back. We went into the library to see an exhibit they had called Treasures, very cool. Went from there back to the hotel for a nap before dinner. We were both still tired and hungry so we decided to try the restaurant at the hotel, Madison and Vine for our Anniversary dinner. It was delicious and close.\\nWaking up Tuesday, we grabbed donuts at Dunkin and ate them on the library benches then back to Grand Central and the #4, this time to 161st Street in The Bronx. Yankee Stadium was a place I wanted to see, and it was worth the side trip. We went to the park across the street where the original stadium stood and took it all in. Headed back to get changed to be at the Ed Sullivan Theatre by 3 to see a taping of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. It was amazing. Afterwards went back, got changed, and since it was dark we headed to 30 Rock to go to the top. Tickets are much cheaper online but I didn\\'t care, it was still worth it. Pictures, pictures, pictures, so many pictures of the skyline at night. Went from there to grab food at the Kati Roll Company at 39th and 6th. Great grab and go Indian Food.\\nSlept in Wednesday and headed towards MoMa, but ultimately decided not to because we knew we\\'d lose track of time and miss our reason for coming to NYC in the first place. We had 2pm matinee tickets to Hadestown. Wow, just wow. The Walter Kerr Theater is small and with a single intermission, the one Mens bathroom line was long. Worth every dime and minute. After the show, we went to the Drama Bookshop and dinner at Artichoke Basille\\'s Pizza. Great food.\\nThursday was checkout and head to the airport. Uber showed up and we got to LGA incredibly early. I took the front desk guy\\'s suggestion for time to leave and it was generous. If you want an accurate time, Google Maps was right on the travel time and LGA\\'s website was accurate for security wait. We went through quick and easy. LGA is nice, much, much nicer than STL where we flew out of. Got home safe, sound and in time for dinner.\\nThank you all for you support and suggestions. It was a wonderful trip. Hope this helps ayone who is heading that way. Great trip report. It sounds like you two had a great time. So glad you had a great time. Happy anniversary! Really enjoyed reading this - thanks! Yup...good stuff(except the Yankee Stadium part!) Another great read. Sounds like you had a wonderful time and yes, Belated Anniversary Bests.\\nHere\\'s the link to the first installment if you missed it.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13688242-Trip_Report_9_26_9_30-New_York_City_New_York.html In case you were unable to get inside Federal Hall, it is an architectural shocker with a domed rotunda---not what one would expect from the exterior. @ter1413, That\\'s funny! @Fox11354, Federal Hall was closed with the steps fenced off. Thanks for that, it\\'ll be on the list for the return trip. Thank you all for the well wishes, it was an amazing time. Happy anniversary and thank you for the great trip report\\nI went to the Drama Bookshop on my last trip as I was so happy that it had finally reopened and I will definitely go back on my next trip. Nice trip. Thanks for your trip report. thanks for the report. we are heading there in 3 weeks from the midwest with a teen. I am glad you mentioned uber; trip advisor\\'s \"how to get from LGA\" to manhattan, only mentioned taxis! so that is a big help to know uber\\'s available. And good to hear about Hadestown. thanks for sharing Hi\\nI am due to visit with my child who is under the age for the U.K. vaccination program. I have seen that Broadway /MSG require them to have a PCR test within 72 hours or the rapid antigen testing within 6 hours showtime.\\nMy question is would a U.K. PCR taken before travel be sufficient as it will be dated and timed ? Or if I could bring our rapid tests over and take a picture of date and time?\\nI have looked to see there is walk in places around Times Square but not sure if it’s wishful thinking of being able to use the ones from the U.K.\\nThank you When is this trip planned for? The vaccine for kids may be available in the next month and the rules may change. It’s booked for December, they are only just rolling out 12-15 and no plans for under 12 so he will be unvaccinated If it’s within the time period, the test should be fine, wherever it is taken. Many theaters have specific requirements and you should check what hours requires. https://thisisbroadway.org/pages/safety The US FDA and/or CDC is considering Pfizer for 5-11s at a meeting on Oct 14-15. So even if approved then, it would likely be November before it was rolled out in US, maybe longer in UK.\\nJust for safety\\'s sake, the OP might want to have child (and maybe self) get quick antigen test just before performance. A lot of COVID is transmitted in airports. In fact, legislation has now been proposed in US to require proof of vax or testing for domestic US flights, which are currently completely unregulated. So it sounds like you plan to go to a Braodway show the day after you get there? The rules say 72 hours so I would think even if taken in the UK, if it is official and dated, and time stamped, I don\\'t know why it wouldn\\'t count. 72 hours is 72 hours, after all.\\nThey aren\\'t very clear on the instructions, and I sure hope they wouldn\\'t just allow any self test without it being supervised and witnessed, otherwise it\\'s a load of nonsense. Anyone could jsut fake the results by dipping the swab in water or something, after all. Self tests are generally for use by people who really want to know themselves, so they don\\'t have an incentive to cheat. That\\'s why no airline, etc., will accept self tests unless they are supervised and witnessed (you have to have a video call appointment and an app to set them up). If you aren\\'t counting on one of those, I\"d just forget it as there isn\\'t any official dating and timing of results otherwise, either.\\nIf you are planning the video call, etc. antigen test I think you\\'d have to call the theater to ask them, unfortunately. Not sure how well they are answering, but of course you\\'d ask the 72 hour one first if that suffices. I suspect it would, but am just speculating. The results don\\'t say anything about how it has to have taken place after a flight or whatever, or has to be in the US.\\nI did see an article by a guy on this rule and he said he HAD to be the official monitored, video call supervised test if you do the self test. That makes sense. He didn\\'t state the source of his info, but he\\'s a journalist of some kind.\\nI would say you personally taking some photo of date and time of a self-test (not sure what that means), would NOT be acceptable., as you say you aantt o do.It shouldn\\'t be, acceptable\\n. Any legitimate test provides datesdresults on their end. in an official manner,\\nGiven this requirement, you\\'d think there would be many pop-up tent testing sites nearby, they could make a fortune even just be charging a reasonable amount, like $25.\\nIf you are coming soon, here is a van doing it in Times Square until Oct 31st, at least.\\nhttps://www.timessquarenyc.org/whats-happening/cts-mobile-covid-testing-van\\nIf it\\'s convenient and near you, you could try that maybe 5 hours ahead of curtain time? For those of us with teens in the UK, they are also going to be offered only one shot, as thing currently stand, so assume will not count as fully vaccinated by US standards. I’ll be interested to hear from other travellers of their experience once borders open. As more visitors from a wider variety of countries enter New York, it will be interesting how different local vaccination protocols are dealt with. Ok, just got back yesterday from my wife and I\\'s 25th Anniversary trip to NYC. It was both of ours first trip to NYC and this forum was invaluable to us in having a great trip, so I want to give back any way I can. The days are a blur so I\\'ll try to keep it in order.\\nWe arrived 9:30am Sunday at LGA on American, deplaning at Terminal B. First impression, LGA is gorgeous. The terminal is well signed and easy to find where you\\'re going. We got our bags and followed the signs for App Based Pickup to the Terminal B garage. Fired up the Uber app and in under 5 minutes had a clean, well maintained ride to the Hotel for $50ish before tip.\\nThe hotel we stayed at was The Library Hotel by The Library Hotel Collection. It\\'s a small, boutique hotel a block from the NYC Public Library at the corner of 41st and Madison. The room was really nice, and larger than others I had looked at. They had us ready for early check in and there was a bottle of champagne waiting in the room, with a card congratulating us on our anniversary. If you\\'re a library dweller or literature fan like my wife is (her Bachelors is in Literature and her Masters is Composition and Rhetoric) look this place up. If my wife could live in a hotel, it would be this one. Covid eliminated a lot of their social hours but the second floor lounge is incredible and the coffee is great. The rooftop bar is a great place to grab a drink at night as well.\\nSunday - After checking in, we got to walking, and boy did we walk. First impression is that the buildings around you are taller than you think, and get used to the smell of weed, it\\'s everywhere. Not a partaker but not offended by it either, just surprised, you do get used to it fast. Started at the NYC Library and Bryant Park walked 5th Ave to Central Park, stopping constantly to take pics of the sights. Walked through the first block of Central Park and back down 6th, taking in the sights. Started to get hungry so we stopped at Pizza Arte. Delicious brick oven sandwiches and with Covid most small eateries have converted the parking area on the street into outside dining. We left there and walked down 6th until we cut over to Times Square. Walked around until my wife found what she was looking for. In a former sporting goods store, just off Times Square the trade group that does costuming for Broadway and TV had an exhibit. She got more from it than I did, but it was still interesting. Both of us tired, we went back to our room for a nap. We woke up about 8 and headed out for dinner. I have to say my favorite part was walking after dark, I took pics galore. We ended up at a small bar/restaurant called Valerie. Great burger, salads, and spinach artichoke dip. We were asked for vaccine cards and ID every time we went in to a place that wasn\\'t a quick order and leave. Not an issue for us, it was expected. Headed back through Times Square to see it all lit up and take many photos. Headed back for much needed sleep.\\nI\\'m going to seperate this because I\\'m afraid of losing everything I\\'ve typed. Great trip report! I am looking forward to reading more about your trip. I keep hearing about smelling weed in NYC. Weed is legal recreationally in SF and you don\\'t smell it everywhere. I wonder if maybe only some areas of NYC allow weed dispensaries? Or are they everywhere? Funny.....I don\\'t smell much weed at all like some on TA have mentioned. Thank you for taking the time to post your report, looking forward to the rest.\\nOn our most recent visit to NYC in July, the weed smell was much more noticeable than when I was there in April and May. Perhaps it had to do with being outdoors in many park like settings, but often noticed walking many a sidewalk. I got the followup posted. Walking the area of 5th to 8th from 38th to Central Park the weed smell was prevalent, again I don\\'t care, but some do. It should really be expected in Times Square especially at night. We noticed they actually have a bus like mobile dispensary rolling around TS. Like i said you get used to it. Thanks for the comments y\\'all, I will definitely return. It was incredible. Re: weed (responding to Travel Chick) - there still aren’t dispensaries in NY (the state’s regulatory wheels grind slowly), so that’s not the explanation. I think it’s just that people all over the city enjoy smoking it, and it was widely tolerated even before recreational use was formally legalized.\\nI’m sure the prevalence varies across neighborhoods - more in parks, plazas and areas with lots of young people, less in office districts. This is great ...thanks for taking the time to write it up.\\nHere\\'s the second installment so they don\\'t get separated as the days go by and they get pushed off the first page\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13688283-Trip_Report_9_26_9_30_continued-New_York_City_New_York.html Thank you for that, I didn\\'t think of it. Thanks for your trip report. I\\'m planning a weekend trip for the first weekend in December (2 adults and 2 boys, ages 14 and 11). Looking to be in walking distance to some attractions and/or restaurants but obviously know we\\'ll need to use the subway or taxi to do other things. Looking for hotel recommendations in the 250-350/night range. 1 room, 2 beds.\\nWe\\'re planning to see a Broadway Show, Rockefella Center, Holiday Markets. Any other recommendations for tween/teenage boys welcome. We hope to have a somewhat relaxed itinerary so we can just enjoy the sights and decide on a whim what we\\'ll do (with the exception of Broadway, obviously). Is it for 2 nights, say Saturday and Sunday nights?\\nI took a look at booking.com for 3 adults and 1 child (the 14 y/o will be classed as an adult) and The William is showing a Double Studio for $810.00 in total. That\\'s a big room with two double beds and a small kitchenette with coffee machine, microwave etc. It\\'s a good location for walking to the Midtown sights. Grand Central Terminal is close for many subway lines.\\nTake a look directly with the hotel as well, to compare rates: http://www.thewilliamnyc.com/ The EVEN Hotel Midtown East is coming in at $668.00 in total on booking.com (free cancellation until 11/26) for two double beds but that\\'s a much smaller room, no kitchenette and further east. It\\'s reviewed as Fabulous on booking.com and Excellent on TA. My wife, two teenagers and I stay at either the Westin Times Square or the Sheraton Times Square during the Christmas holiday. Usually a weekend and two nights.\\nI have no idea about the rates as I use my Marriott Bonvoy points.\\nThe Westin Times Square is near Times Square and Broadway theaters and the Sheraton Times Square is near Rockefeller Center. The first weekend in Dec. is one of the most expensive (and busiest) of the year. Your money will go further later in the month. The tourist attractions you mention are in midtown.\\nThe Hilton Garden Inn Times Square and the Hampton Inn Times Square North are older hotels (but updated) with bigger than normal for NYC rooms and have 2 queen beds vs the more typical 2 doubles that you find elsewhere. Location is between Times Square and Central Park.so you can walk to everything you listed. There other hotels with 2 queens. The Knickerbocker is very nice but likely over budget for early Dec.\\nIn most hotels, the 14 year old may not be considered an adult.\\nThe Intrepid Air & Space Museum is popular with boys their age as is the Museum of Natural History. Just had a look and the HGI I mentioned looks sold out for that weekend and the Hampton Inn TSN is much more expensive. The San Carlos in midtown east is a good option to consider. Their decor is a bit dated but rooms are big, 2 queen beds and you\\'re walking distance to Rockefeller Center a d the Xmas tree.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d80112-Reviews-San_Carlos_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html Next month when in NYC myself and my wife would like to visit Washington. Any advice on the best way to do this? We have seen coach trips which take in all the main places one would like to see, but have also seen one which also stops off at Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell.\\nAre we best to organise our own transport via Amtrak or do any of the coach trips offer good value? Are all the sights in Washington DC within walking distance? Take that one day and add it to the one day you plan to see all 5 boroughs of NYC. It is 3.5 hours by train to DC. No way to do Philly, too, but if you leave NYC very early and return late you can get 8 hours in DC if that suits you. That would mean a 6AM train and a return around 9PM to NYC Following as I’m interested in doing the same thing. The major sites in DC are walking distance IF you enjoy long walks. Look at a map of the \"National Mall\" (a long skinny park lined with tourist attractions). The biggest tourist attractions not on the National Mall are the White House and the Jefferson Monument, which aren\\'t that far away (but in opposite directions). I would actually skip viewing the White House from outside if you have limited time in DC, but I realize why you might want to see it. The Jefferson Monument is really pretty.\\nIf you like museums, you really should spend a few days in Washington. The Smithsonian Museums are really good, and unlike NYC, they are mostly located in the same area (along the National Mall) and are mostly free.\\nIf you don\\'t care about the museums (or only want to go to one - I\\'d recommend Air and Space, as it is the most unique to Washington), you can get a decent sense federal district of the city in one very long day.\\nEdited: 2:13 pm, October 02, 2021 Lots to see in D.C. -- outstanding museums and historical sites. Better to stay at least overnight or several days. Philadelphia is 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 hours from NYC on Amtrak, so it\\'s better suited for day trips from NYC. Philadelphia also has great museums and historical sites -- great restaurants, too Agree with Daman and Tantalus. Similar to the notion of seeing 5 boroughs in a day, Washington is really more than a daytrip partly because of travel time and partly because there are so many big museums. BUT if you don\\'t think you\\'ll be back to the US anytime soon and are willing to have a long day and give up a day in NYC, several regular posters have done a day trip on their own by Amtrak train. I will look for their trip reports and post a link. Here,s a link to more discussion and Aynat\\'s description of her daytrip.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k10521225-One_day_to_D_C-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nWhat you should not do, IMO is take a tour bus. Traffic can be awful and spending most of the day on the bus vs a more comfortable train ride is the way to go. But be aware, cheapest Amtrak fares are I think at least 2+ weeks in advance. I was in Washington DC over the summer for a weekend. You could take early train to Washington DC to Union Station\\nAt Union Station take the DC Metro (Washington DC Subway) to the Metro Center Station , Its 3 stops. From the Metro center Station walk to The White House, then walk towards the Washington Monumenet.You can walk to the Lincoln Memorial, Jefferson Memorial , Vietnam Memorial and lots of other Statues and Landmarks on the National Mall here. After done in this section , Walk back towads the Capital (You can easily see everything)\\nOn the way towards the Capital, the National Mall is Lined by Museums of the Smithsonian you can pick 1 or 2 to visit if you have time , The Museum of American History and the Air and Space are the 2 best choices. When done , walk past the Capital the Supreme Court is Behind the Capital and then Walk back to Union Station and catch the train back to NYC Note the Air and Space Museum is currently under construction with many of the exhibits closed. If the Air and Space is Closed , then pick the Museum of Natural History in DC, Its similar to the one in NYC, which is why I didnt recommend it first, but they have the Hope diamond and its worth a visit, there are also lots of cool looking gardens as well, I had a whole day to wander on the National Mall, something I had never done before and the gardens and some of the Scuplues outside were really cool I\\'ve already gotten so much help through this forum planning my trip so feel like I am fine-tuning at this time. We are a senior couple traveling together. We have both been to NYC in the past but it was with kids and grandchildren. Now it\\'s just our turn. Not frantic to see everything. Want to have a fun and relaxing trip. Especially interested in Broadway so have planned around three shows. MET and 911 Museum are very important as are relaxing, easy meals and maybe stopping by a fun bar for a cocktail. Looking for any major flaws in my planning.\\nWe arrive JFK about 10:30 pm and will taxi to San Carlos Hotel. We\\'ll be lucky to arrive at hotel by midnight I would think.\\nTues, Oct 19\\n9am NY in One Day Guided Tour (6hour duration on mini-bus, etc.\\n7pm Come From Away\\nWed., Oct 20\\nHudson Yards, Citrovia, The Vessel if open, The High Line.\\nLunch at Chelsea Market (maybe Los Tacos), Little Island if open, Meatpacking District. Anyone know why Little Island is showing as closed from 10/17-10/23?\\n7pm Wicked\\nThur., Oct 21\\n10am 911 Museum (2-3 hours)\\nBattery Park OR Stephen Colbert if we make it off the waitlist.\\nFri., Oct 22\\nEllis Island ferry from Battery Park.

I personally wouldn’t do Stephen Colbert after the 9/11 museum. I personally needed some time after to get my head straight\\nEdited: 1:54 pm, September 30, 2021 Do you have the Ferry booked for Ellis Island? The NYC in one day tour….expect to spend a lot of time sat in traffic, not my cup of tea personally but if it’s something you really want to do then go for it The horse carriage rides - again not for me, they can’t go into the park proper (they stick to the roads) and in 2014 I stayed in the JW Marriott Essex House with a view of the park and to put it politely, I did not like what I saw You must have ferry tickets for Ellis Island. The museum is amazing so plan 2-3 hours there. 4 hours if you plan to get off at SOL too. Ferry is 30 minutes but you may have to wait and there is security too. Plan at least a 1/2 day for Ellis Island and longer if you do both islands.\\nNo horse carriage ride. They are not good for the horses.\\nThe Cloisters is great but needs a 1/2 day at least due to location.\\nSaturday AM has too much between 11:00 and 2:00.\\nRemember that although the subway is fast, you have to build in time to wait for trains. It always takes longer to get somewhere than you think. 9/11 Museum. I have been twice. I spent just under 4 hours each time. I saw Come From Away after viewing the 9/11 Museum and various memorials in the area. The play is uplifting and I found it a welcome reminder that as horrific as that day was there was also good.\\nI always go to the Met first thing Sunday morning when it opens. People don\\'t start showing until noon. In any case the Met looks it still requires timed tickets which you buy online so skip the line wouldn\\'t make sense. \"Anyone know why Little Island is showing as closed from 10/17-10/23?\"\\nIt\\'s not closed.\\nPer the website:\\n\"Timed Entry is required after 12pm on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.\\nTimed Entry is not required any other days.\"\\nThere are reservations available for Sunday 10/17 and Saturday 10/23. There are no dates listed for Monday 10/18 through Friday 10/22 because reservations aren\\'t needed. Thanks, TraceyW and RTRMommy for your input. I am reconsidering carriage ride. Have not booked Ellis Island Ferry yet. High priority event for us but I figured I have plenty of time before we go. Probably won\\'t go to SOL. Realizing that NYC Public Library, Morgan Library and Bryant Park may not all fit in before my 2pm matinee on Saurday. We will just adjust it to the time we have. Thanks to sgsatw for suggestion on entering MET early Sunday. Thank you to CTRH for clarifying entry on Little Island. The ferry first goes to Liberty Island, then Ellis Island, so it\\'s the same ticket. Book in advance as mentioned. Hi, we’re 5 friends heading to NYC to celebrate a 50th birthday, but we’re finding it quite hard to find accommodation. Any recommendations for apartment/ suites/ hotel rooms.? We’re going in March 2022. Budget?\\nExact dates?\\nHow many beds do you need? Hi, it’s for 5 nights, from 17th March to 22nd March a bed each would be perfect but it doesn’t really matter. Nothing too expensive. We use euros but converting to USD it’s about 1600 to 1700;USD.? Thanks for your reply Is that per person? For the whole party?\\nWould some of you be willing to share a bed so that you would only need 3 rather than 5 It’s for the whole party , we’ve been looking at booking.com and other sites and they’re coming up arounf 1500 to 1600 euros. Yes we would be willing to share, no problem. Thanks. Ii\\'d be curious to know what you found that comes in within your budget? $1700 for 5 nights is less than $300/night when you consider taxes and fees. Since there aren\\'t many places that sleep 5 adults, I think you have a problem. Most booking sites won\\'t even allow you to input 5 adults in for 1 room.\\nBest Westeen Hospitality has a 2 bedroom suite with a king bed, 2 singles and a sofabed, but the cheapest price is $460//night plus taxes. It does include breakfast a d you do get a full kitchen, but still well over $1000 above your budget. I thought Radio. It’s Apartments might work but that,s also over budget. There are some hotels with bunkbed rooms, but not for 5 afaik. Maybe a family rooms at the Tryp Times Square but I didn\\'t check.\\nYou,d likely be better splitting up into 2 rooms.\\nIf you’re using JFK airport, you might be able to find something in Long Island City near a subway stop. Perhaps they are looking at short term apartment rentals (and are unaware they are mostly illegal here)? Check out Best Western plus hospitality house Thanks will do that Yes we’re looking at short term we’re only there for 5 nights, going through booking.com and trip advisor we can get places easy for 4 people but not so easily for 5. Thanks , yes we are flying to JFK so I’ll look at Long Island city. I’ve been fortunate to stay with friends in many different areas of the city on my visits. Park Slope, SoHo, E 82nd Street, W 28th Street, E 38th Street, and W 50th. On my next trip, I’m staying at The Kimberly on E 50th. I’ll only be in town for a week so I want to make the most of the neighborhood. I’ve already scoped out local services and restaurants to some extent, but I wonder if you have any must-dos or hidden spots to recommend.\\nThanks for any tips!\\nKaki It\\'s not a particularly charming neighborhood. It\\'s offices and fast food places and a high end restaurant or two. There\\'s a cute little urban park at 3 East 53rd with a waterfall. And another one at 217 E 51st St. There\\'s a cute coffee place in a flower shop called Remi Flower & Coffee at 906 Second Av (at 48th St)\\nNot far from many midtown points of interest, MoMA, Grand Central, Chrysler Building, etc. If you like Japanese stuff there is Katagirl Japanese Grocery at 224 E 59th St. I go there sometimes if I want stuff from Japan and you can get Ramen/Sushi there as takeaway. Little further up by the Roosevelt Tram is Serendipity at 225 E 60th St. Their frozen hot chocolate is cool. Buttercup Bakeshop mentioned in the other thread has the best red velvet cupcakes I had in NYC. They are very rich though. \"They are very rich though\"\\nYou say this like it\\'s a bad thing. MeeMee, you never fail to crack me up. Hey, I\\'ve haven\\'t been in NYC in 21 months. I\\'ve got to amuse myself somehow (fingers crossed for an epic Christmas visit). Greenacre Park is nearby on E50th which is a hidden gem of an urban park with a waterfall and a cafe. I don\\'t know if the cafe is open though.\\nhttps://greenacrepark.org/\\nEss-a-Bagel is right around the corner on 3rd Ave. They have some of the best bagels in the city.\\nThere is an UrbanSpace food court on Lexington and 51st St which might be good for some casual food or lunch.\\nhttps://www.urbanspacenyc.com/570-lexington Actually, Greenacre Park, which is open, is on the north side of E 51st street between 2d and 3d Avs. The cafe is also open, though am not sure what the hours are. I happened to stop by there on Saturday and was surprised how crowded it was.It is an extraordinarily beautiful little vest pocket park that was underwritten by a member of the Rockefeller family -- the late Abby Rockefeller Mauze. I believe at one time the Rockefellers owned a lot of property in the area (I think they may have donated some of the land for the UN) and a number of them lived at nearby One Beekman Place. They do some extraordinary seasonal decorating at that park. I happened to be sitting in it a couple years ago in the day the day they were starting autumn decorating -- haystacks, pumpkins, gourds, etc., but am not sure if that has continued during pandemic. Also note Greenacre Park is not open late. I think it may be seasonal, like they close the gate at sundown or so, whenever that may be. Greenacre is one of the two I gave addresses for in post 1. The other is Paley. Sometimes easier to find with an address to plug into gps for tourists (or cabdrivers. 😉). According to The NY Post:\\nBroadway is back — and so is coronavirus.\\n“Aladdin” performances have been halted after unnamed members in the musical’s cast and/or crew tested positive for COVID-19. The Broadway show had just reopened on Tuesday but will now be shut down again\\n. I\\'m not a Broadway person, but I read that earlier. For those intersted, They are offering $50 tickets to Alladin\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/urv42b9m\\nFully refundable I wouldn\\'t be surprised if there were more of this -- that is, temporary closings. Huh, all cast and crew had to be fully vaccinated too. \"Huh, all cast and crew had to be fully vaccinated too.\" Explains why none of them are in the hospital or dying of covid. They may have not even been symptomatic because they were doing covid testing on cast as part of their protocols. Also, the performances of Aladin are resuming tonight because of their protocols and because they fortunately had the cast and crew vaccinated and therefore the virus didn\\'t spread like wildfire the way it would of if it was a bunch of unvaccinated people.\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/aladdin-shuts-down-one-day-after-reopening-due-breakthrough-covid-cases Luckily they are all vaccinated so it didn\\'t spread like wild fire and hopefully symptoms were mild. Breakthrough cases definitely still happen (though the % of cases is still much lower in vaccinated), it is in the severe illness and death where you see the really great effects of the vaccine. Can\\'t wait to get my booster next week.\\nThere likely will be more cancellations but hopefully they catch any problems early so it doesn\\'t cause too much disruption or illness. Backstage spaces are cramped and I\\'m not sure how much they could do to improve ventilation\\nPerfect conditions for airborne transmission The Pfizer vaccine is starting to fade and the head of Moderna thinks theirs will by winter. However, he thinks a third does may last a very long time, but we shall see. No vaccine has ever been proved 100% effective in preventing disease. I just received an email advising me that the performance of Jagged Little Pill that I was scheduled to see on Nov.3rd. has been cancelled. No explanation. But, can exchange for another show or same show at another date. Before the lockdown, masks, vaccinations, etc., around 25 members of the cast and crew of Moulin Rouge got COVID, some serious cases. Danny Burstein, who just won a Tony for his role, became seriously ill and had to be hospitalized for a week or two. Hi, I’ve got flights booked for NYC in April, I’ve reserved the Marmara Hotel which is suppose to be 5 Star with spa but lots of mixed reviews I’m also looking at the Ludlow which is 4 star but looks cool ?\\nWhich one would you recommend? Or a different hotel I’m staying 4 nights and want to spend around £1000 but happy to go a Up to £1500 if the hotel is amazing.\\nThank you in advance katie How many people and beds? What are your exact dates? What is your budget in USD? Any preferred neighbourhoods or facilities you want? Do you have any plans/reservations?\\nAll of the above will help the local hotel experts give you better answers Is this your first time visiting?\\nI ask because those 2 hotels are in totally different locales and The neighborhoods will have different vibes.\\nMarmara Park ave is in Midtown @ E 32nd street\\nThe Ludlow is in the Lower Eastside in Manhattan.\\nBTW there is another Marmara - The Marmara Manhattan on the Upper East side.\\nAt the top of your budget, however if I was you I would consider the Sherry Netherland Hotel.\\nFantastic location on Fifth Avenue between E 58 and 59th St.Super close to Central Park and the famous Plaza Hotel.\\nMuch better locale for a base, that the Marmara Park Ave or the Ludlow IMO esp if it’s your first time visiting.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d93559-Reviews-The_Sherry_Netherland_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html There are only 2 negative reviews I see here on TA of the Marmara Park Ave. Have you looked elsewhere? But know things since the pandemic are not the same in hotels. What make a 5* is amenities and service. Service in most all hotels is curtailed. What specifically are you wanting in the hotel? The 2 you mention couldn\\'t be more different in location and vibe. The Ludlow is in a hip area of the city and has that vibe while the Marmara is more traditional and most if not all their rooms are like apartments. If you want “cool” the Ludlow fits the bill. There are other cool options too like the Dominick in Soho, the Bowery hotel on the lower east side, the Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca that also has a nice spa. If you\\'re looking for cool, the Marmara isn\\'t it. The Whitby and the Crosby St. are owned by firmdale, the UK co. and cool but pricey.\\nNOTE the Marmara Manhattan is currently closed and not relevant to this conversation.\\nEdited: 4:27 pm, October 02, 2021 I just looked at your post from a year ago, and assuming you never made that trip, the Marmara doesn\\'t . sound like the location or vibe you want. Without dates, I don\\'t know what will fit your budget But\\nmrandmrssmith.com\\nis a site that specializes in boutique hotels. Not saying you need to use them to book, but they have good pictures and options.\\nEdited: 4:39 pm, October 02, 2021 Will be visiting Oct. 21 - 25 with family---including my 8 year old granddaughter---her first time in NYC! (She had the choice of Disney or NYC---so glad she chose NYC)! Looking for events she may enjoy. If you have any other suggestions--please tell. Has anyone dined at American Girl? Thanks!

If she doesn\\'t play with dolls, maybe you can give the store and the cafe a pass. Or ask her? I know whatever you do, you will make great memories. I spent a lot of time with one of my grandmothers and have such fond memories of the shows we saw together and the restaurants SHE liked and shared with me, most simple places, sadly all gone. But show Ellie your favorite places. **I feel like this is going to be an expensive trip for me!

I love carousels also----adding my favorite, Seaglass , for sure! Will write a trip report upon return! Is this itinerary doable for first time visitors? My bf and I are staying in Midtown and plan to walk/catch the subway. We both are in our early 30\\'s, fairly fit, love to eat lol. We like to start the day early and don\\'t mind staying out late to sight-see. We tend to take our time window shopping, taking pictures and snacking at different cafes/ to go restaurants, with an occasional dine in restaurant here and there.\\nI tried to not overbook because I know things happen and there will likely be new attractions we want to do upon arrival. These are the things we would like to cover (we also have additional sites not listed here in case we so happen to have extra time).\\nDay 1: arrive at JFK 1130 am. Visit QUEENS: Woodside, flushing Chinatown and Jackson Heights (possibly Astoria and Sunnyside). Possibly Queen\\'s International Night Market\\nDay 2: Stroll Greenwich Village and see Friends tv apartment, short visit to High Line, Chelsea Market. Visit Bronx Little Italy. Possibly visit Time Square on the way back to our hotel, if there\\'s time.\\nDay 3: Sunrise walk through Brooklyn Bridge. explore DUMBO/downtown Brooklyn. Visit 911 museum (free after 3:30 pm on Mondays),ground zero, Oculus. Ride Staten Island ferry to see Statue of Liberty, take it back to Manhattan.\\nDay 4: Visit Top of the Rock at 10 am. Stroll Central Park by bike. MET museum. Broadway show from 7-10 pm\\nDay 5: Stroll Soho, Chinatown and Little Italy Manhattan. Possibly visit Brooklyn or Queens again. Time Square\\nDay 6: Catch subway to Newark for 10 am flight It\\'s doable, but I have a slight suggestion....\\nInstead of wandering Queens with your luggage on arrival day I would go to Queens for a full day on your day 5, and just go to SoHo, Chinatown and Manhattan Little Italy on your arrival day after checking in to your hotel. You wouldn\\'t need as much time to see these areas but a full day in Queens sounds like what you are looking for.\\nHowever, this would only work if your day 5 is a Saturday because the Queens Night Market is only on Saturdays. If you really want to go there and your arrival day is a Saturday then keep your days as planned.\\nOn your day 3, I would suggest going over to Brooklyn via the subway or ferry and looking around then walking the BB back to Manhattan. The views are better this way, no need to keep turning around to look at the Manhattan skyline.\\nAnother query I have is your day 4 where you want to \"stroll Central Park by bike\". Will you have a bike? Then yes, you will be strolling the bike on the smaller paths where bikes are not allowed, otherwise you can ride on the major roads in there. It would help knowing when you are going. The itinerary is easier to do in October than February.\\nI would move Times Square from Day 2 to Day 4 as you will be in Times Square at night when you exit the Broadway show I think it’s more than doable, with plenty of downtime/time for serendipity. Aynat’s suggestion in #1 is a good one - reiterating my comment from your Queens thread, you’re really not saving any time by going to these neighborhoods on your way from JFK, and hauling luggage around will detract from the experience.\\nAs an example of what I mean by your itinerary having plenty of downtime, take a look at Day 2:\\n“Stroll Greenwich Village and see Friends tv apartment, short visit to High Line, Chelsea Market. Visit Bronx Little Italy. Possibly visit Time Square on the way back to our hotel, if there\\'s time.”\\nStrolling those neighborhoods & the High Line will take the morning. Heading up to Arthur Avenue (and having lunch there?), the afternoon. No need to stop by Times Square, as jcmtl points out, since you’ll be there on your Broadway show night. And even if you’re dying to see it and want to go multiple times (for many people, once is enough), chances are it’s close enough to your Midtown hotel to require just a very short detour.\\nSo what are you going to do with your evening?\\nActually, your evenings in general appear free - except for the Broadway show and, if you do it, the Queens Night Market - so think about what things you can do at night. Walking the Brooklyn Bridge at night is spectacular, for example (I think the direction you do it depends more on the logistics of your itinerary than any difference in facing/not facing Manhattan - the skyline stretches a long way, so you’ll spend much of the tine looking to the side anyway). So is riding the Staten Island ferry.\\nYou can also use evenings to return to neighborhoods you particularly like, or explore new ones.\\nEnjoy! Hello everyone. Thank you for your suggestions! I am visiting from October 16-21. My bf really wants to attend the Queens International Night Market which is held on Saturdays only, so I\\'m considering changing up our hotel book and staying in Queens our first night. This way we can have them hold our luggage until check in. We\\'d also have the next day to \"finish up\" in Queens before heading out to Manhattan for the duration of our stay. For such a short visit, I don’t think changing hotels makes sense. It would eat up time that you could otherwise use sightseeing & exploring.\\nIf the Queens Night Market is a priority (and though I haven’t been this year, I agree it’s great & worth doing), it doesn’t get started until the evening, so I don’t understand the urgency about dropping off your bags at a hotel in Queens. It’s not hard at all to get from midtown Manhattan to any of your destinations in Queens…it’s often easier, in fact, than to get from one part of Queens to another. (We outer borough residents know that the subway system is very Manhattan-centric.)\\nFor that reason - in addition to limited stomach capacity, as mcwhippet has pointed out! - I really feel you’d be better served by breaking Queens into chunks and seeing/eating different parts on different days. Have lunch in Jackson Hts on your way from the airport if you want (I know I’m in the minority on this, but my personal experience tells me it’s doable), check into your hotel in Manhattan, do a few Manhattan things, then head back to the Night Market in the evening. There’s your Day 1.\\nOn Day 2, just pick a cuisine/neighborhood and have dinner in Queens.\\nDay 3 is downtown/Brooklyn/Staten Island, so Queens is less practical (you could try Sri Lankan in SI, though!). Day 4 is busy & you have your Broadway show…but Day 5 is pretty much wide open.\\nTotally doable! Listen, I would be miserable dragging luggage around Queens and possibly the night market.\\nAs others have stated, it can be very easy to get between Manhattan and Queens. You would be much more comfortable dropping off your luggage and heading back.\\nQueens is not hours away.\\nSpending the night in a Queens hotel for such a short trip eats into what you could be doing. I agree that a hotel in Queens for one night doesn’t make sense in your situation. Not just for the length of time, but being a first time visitor too. I really shouldn’t have thrown out that idea without knowing more about you and your trip, so I’m sorry if I lead you down the wrong path. I think I was more just having a thought than giving a practical suggestion.\\nI absolutely agree with going to the hotel first and heading out from there. You are getting in quite early, so you still have time to poke about (Queens or otherwise) and still head to the Night Market.\\nA great thing about being in Manhattan and then heading out there, is the subway ride. Yes, it can be a long ride, but it is going to be all new to you. If you are anything like me, you will be thinking “omg, I am finally in New York City, and omg, I’m riding the subway! And this is one of the coolest things ever!” Something along that line. So just sit back and enjoy the ride, the people, the sights and the sounds.\\nI do agree with Linda to fit Queens areas bit by bit in the itinerary, and go back and forth from Manhattan, rather than trying to make a marathon “Queens Day Out”. I think it would be tiring and frustrating that way.\\nI also agree that your itinerary is very doable and it sounds quite lovely. Lots of room to tuck in some good yummy meals along the way! I\\'ll go ahead and keep my original booking and drop off my luggage before heading back to Queens. Thank you all for your help! You all rock! That’s great news! I think you will be happy with that decision. I would love to read a trip report (nudge nudge). Hope you have a great time! :) Do you know how you\\'re getting to Arthur Ave in the Bronx? It\\'s doable with public transportation but nothing will drop you right off in that section of the Bronx. So, my check out time is 11am and I need to be at JFK around 2 or 3pm. I’m not sure if the hotel will keep my luggage, so I’m trying to figure out what to do while carrying a rolling suitcase.\\nI’m thinking of maybe going and sitting in Central Park or finding a cafe I can sit in and journal, or post a trip report on TA. I do worry about carrying luggage on the train, not sure if that is super common or not.\\nAny fun excursions I could do in or near Chelsea for a few hours? Most hotels will hold it if you’ve been a guest and going back for the same day - be prepared to tip (and possibly pay - this varies) “ . I’m not sure if the hotel will keep my luggage,”\\nI’ve never stayed in a hotel that wouldn’t.\\nI’d call them to be certain. Your hotel will(should) keep your luggage. What time is your flight? \"I do worry about carrying luggage on the train, not sure if that is super common or not.\"\\nPeople carry luggage or other bulky items that on the trains all the time\\nJust observe the etiquette of not inconveniencing others by blocking doors, seats or aisles Your hotel (Which you mentioned on another thread) , will store the luggage before and after. It’s in the reviews. Don’t take my word for it , call the hotel. Leave your luggage and then head out and have breakfast. Do some last minute stuff and head back to the hotel to p/u your bags and head to the airport based on your flight time.\\nAs already stated, people carry luggage on the train all the time. As another suggestion, you could just head to the airport and spend some time looking at the TWA hotel and amenities in Terminal 5. You\\'ve probably heard about it if you\\'ve been hanging around on this forum. It\\'s very retro and looks space age. You can get food and drink there. There\\'s also a constellation plane set up as a bar.\\nFrom there you can take the AirTrain (free) to whatever terminal you\\'re leaving from.\\nhttps://www.twahotel.com/ Considering your location, I would simply leave your bags at the hotel and check out Union Square and/or Washington Square Park. You can easily fill a few hours at each/both and not be that far from the hotel. 3 Brooklyn Hotels are Reopening\\n(I couldn\\'t edit the incorrect title)\\nThe Sheraton, the Aloft & Hotel Indigo in Downtown Brooklyn are all transitioning back to 100% hotel usage. They were being used to house the homeless during COVID. We stayed at the Sheraton in August & I think they were already 100% hotel use at that time.\\nEdited: 1:13 pm, October 01, 2021 Thanks for the update AutumnHuntress.. Hi everyone! I booked 8 nights at the New Yorker hotel and I don\\'t know if the so called facility or resort fee is due for each night (as they call it \"nightly\" facility fee) or just one-shot per stay. I think they recently changed their rules and decided to apply it just one time per stay. It would be absurd to pay 320$ for services I won\\'t use a part from the wifi which should be included. Does someone have a recent experience at this hotel or know how these things? Booking and Expedia usually include 1 resort fee per stay in their bookings. From their website\\nWhat is the facility fee?\\nThe nightly Facility Fee of $35.00 plus taxes, is a mandatory hotel fee applied to all guests reservations.\\nThe fee includes premium Wi-Fi, unlimited domestic/ international calls, access to the business center (internet, printing etc.) and access to the fitness center\\nhttps://www.newyorkerhotel.com/faq/ **a part from the wifi which should be included.**\\nJust curious why you say it should be included? When \"services\" like this are included w/o a resort fee, they are often already factored into the room rate. It\\'s essentially part of the price. I think it\\'s dumb and while perhaps not technically dishonest or bait & switch it\\'s in that direction, the counter argument is probably that they are just providing an itemized bill, and the items are not optional whether you use them or not. If you have a cancelable reservation, you can pick one of the other hotels that don\\'t charge a fee or include it in the total price of your stay and compare it to what you can get elsewhere. Here,s a link to a list of hotels that do and don,t charge fees\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12580854-189_Manhattan_Hotels_Charging_Resort_Fees_214_That_Do_Not-New_York_City_New_York.html I\\'m sorry guys but the question was if I have to pay it for each night or just one time per stay. I\\'m totally OK with it if I have to pay it one-shot only. @ter1413\\nWiFi today is a basic and obvious service that every 4-stars hotel must offer to clients, same as air conditioning or cleaning service. In Europe hotels don\\'t charge you 40$ for basic services or services you didn\\'t ask for. Reach out to the hotel on Facebook. I see nothing online that suggests it\\'s a one time fee. **In Europe hotels don\\'t charge you 40$ for basic services or services you didn\\'t ask for.**\\nHave you noticed that this is the NYC forum....not Europe? You\\'re question was answered in the very first post and could have been by looking at the hotel\\'s website had you bothered.\\nPlease forgive subsequent posts for trying to provide more information and to clarify.\\nAnd I don\\'t think anyone here is determining Hotel pricing practices so if you want to argue about it you\\'ll need to talk to the hotel.\\nEdited: 9:29 am, October 01, 2021 “ I\\'m sorry guys but the question was if I have to pay it for each night or just one time per stay. I”\\nEach night. “ Nightly fee”.\\nWhether it’s called a “ resort fee “ or “ facility fee” or any number of other terms, the fee is per night.\\nIt’s an accounting/revenue tactic.\\nToo many people ( from the hotel’s point of view) are booking rooms through third-party sites like Expedia, Priceline etc.\\nThe hotel has to give these sites a percentage of the room revenue. But they don’t have to pay them a portion of other revenue. Such as room service, bar bills. Or…facility fees.\\nSo it’s still a $250 room. Whether it’s a $200 room with a $50 fee, or a $250 room without a fee.\\nEdited: 9:33 am, October 01, 2021 Going to the city tomorrow and was planning to eat at Ellen\\'s Stardust Diner.

In mid-2019, which Manhattan hotels charge resort fees, and which do not (also LIC)?\\nEdited: 2 years ago This is a guide for visitors and contributors who may not be familiar with resort fees, and a report on the current status of each of 403 TA-rated Manhattan hotels.\\nThe thread provides two alphabetical lists below of Manhattan resort fee and non-resort fee hotels. It does not include non-hotel temporary lodging. [The thread concludes with reference to Long Island City resort fee hotels.]\\nAlmost half of the hotels in Manhattan now charge a mandatory resort fee (sometimes called a facilities, service, residents, incidental, or destination” fee). Those mandatory fees are required by hotel billing and rate policy--not by law--and carry an extra tax on them. The resort fee is in addition to room rate, tax on the room rate, and any other taxes or fees required by law. (A refundable deposit for incidentals or in case of damage is not a resort fee.) Recently, the number of Manhattan resort fee hotels identified has increased substantially—about a ten-fold increase over the past 3 years, and more than a three-fold increase since early 2018.\\nThe thread may help visitors identify resort fee and no-resort fee hotels, compare hotels for full total costs, and if they wish consider whether total costs and amenities offer a value package given each visitor’s tastes. (Several suggestions for lower- cost lodging are contained in the introduction to https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12125890-2019_UPDATE_Age_18_Manhattan_and_LIC_Hotels_and_Hostels-New_York_City_New_York.html).\\nLIST 1 compiles 189 Manhattan hotels which recently HAVE charged resort fees. Within these 189 resort-fee hotels, those which do NOT provide complimentary coffee service in the rooms as standard (115) are designated with ∎. In other words: 47% of the 403 Manhattan hotels surveyed DO charge resort fees; within those 189 resort fee hotels, 61% do NOT provide complimentary room coffee service. LIST 2 compiles 214 Manhattan hotels which recently have NOT charged resort fees. These comprise 53% of the 403 hotels surveyed. The lists and some policies will change over time.\\nFurther discussion of resort fees is provided at https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12395870-182_Manhattan_hotels_charging_resort_fees_204_that_do_not-New_York_City_New_York.html An objective approach to the general subject of resort fees is described in Post 52 there, and at https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k11167955-o50-2018_Update_56_Manhattan_Hotels_With_Resort_Fees-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nA statistical survey of traveler opinion on resort fees is provided at https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/business/luxury-hotels-urban-areas-cities.html\\nLooking ahead, 63 Manhattan hotels tentatively scheduled to open through December 31, 2021 are at https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12398907-63_New_Reopening_Manhattan_Hotels_June_2019_2021_31_months-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nResort fees can be researched—with this 63-hotel list or to review current policies—using the hotel’s site (or inquiry) or 3rd-party sites showing resort fees (sometimes with taxes) on a lst or later web page.\\nThe input from many contributors has been vital in the development of the thread, and is greatly appreciated. Contributor comments on the lists and discussion of resort fees are welcomed and requested, including experience, opinion, corrections and revisions.\\nLIST I: 189 MANHATTAN HOTELS WHICH HAVE RECENTLY CHARGED RESORT FEES\\nNote: ∎ designates resort fee hotels which do not provide complimentary coffee service in the rooms as standard. (In some, coffee machines may be provided subject to request and availability, and in some coffee may be available at any complimentary meals or in public locations during the day.)\\n[For ease of visitors in finding hotels which have changed names, a property is listed under both recent names, but without repeating a number.]\\nManhattan Resort Fee Hotels\\n1. ∎ ACE\\nAffinia 50 (see FIFTY NYC)\\nAffinia Garden Suites (see Gardens NYC)\\nAffinia Manhattan (see Stewart)\\nAffinia Shelburne (see Shelburne)\\n2. ∎ Algonquin\\nAlise (see Staypineapple, an Artful Hotel)\\n3.

I would like to avoid flying if I can Here is some information:\\nhttps://www.afar.com/magazine/canada-has-reopened-for-travel-from-the-u-dot-s-what-to-know\\nAmtrak is not showing any trains for this route. It seems Megabus made the trip in the past. The ride is something like 11 hours. The US land border from Canada is closed to non-essential travelers and non-US citizens (including Canadians). Thus the usual train and bus options (both noted above) are not available at this time (since obviously there would hardly be any travelers heading to the US). Even if the current closure is lifted later in October, no telling how long it will be before these transport options are re-instated.\\nFlying is your best option. There are flights between various NYC airports and Toronto pretty much every hour.\\nEdited: 1:18 pm, October 01, 2021 Porter Airlines was usually the least expensive option between Newark (EWR) and Toronto. I just checked and it seems that Megabus is not going to Canada. You may take the Flix bus or the train to Buffalo and Niagara Falls and cross the border from there. If the land border is closed, it\\'s closed, n’est-ce pas? Unfortunately as mentioned, train travel is out. Amtrak/Viarail cross-border services in the east or west have not returned since the start of the pandemic.\\nFor bus options, you can checkout www.ourbus.com, it seems they have a route between NYC and Toronto. I was curious so hit up their chat bot. After disappearing and returning 5 minutes later to supposedly check with a human, they say that route is operating. They also provided a link to border crossing info: https://www.ourbus.com/newsdetails/Cross%20Border%20Travel\\nI haven\\'t been up to speed with the border crossing requirements these days, so I don\\'t know what the rules are, especially if you\\'re from the UK.\\nThey do show tickets sold out for certain days, so they are at least selling tickets... If you try it report back to us? Will be in NY with the family in October. I have narrowed down my hotel search to the Cambria in Chelsea or Executive Le Soleil. I would appreciate any insight between these hotels as I have not stayed at either. Thank you in advance for your suggestions. They,re both considered good hotels and not that far apart. In most recent reviews, Executive Le Soleil is doing a better job providing speedy service. Neither hotel is providing daily room service but Exec. Le Soleil seems to be handling requests faster. Read reviews carefully. Thank you for your input. I have read all reviews and they are both highly rated. Due to Covid it feels that there are less reviews available from 2021, so wanted to get opinions from locals who may have a better feel for each hotel currently, including the areas they are located, I know Manhattan has changed since Covid hit. I am not familiar with Executive Le Soleil, but have stayed at the Cambria Suites in Chelsea numerous times in the past several years. The only negative I have with this hotel is that the bathroom sinks are tiny which isn\\'t a deal breaker as all else is so nice. It just means you can\\'t spread out toiletries on a vanity top, which I prefer during a stay. The staff has always been welcoming, friendly and delivers excellent customer service. The rooms newer and clean. The nightly rate is most always affordable compared to many other hotels. And I love the location! It\\'s away from the madness (IMO) of TS, yet easy walk to many areas and the 28th and 33rd subway stations are a short walk away. Yesterday I booked our annual December holiday stay here again.\\nI just looked at the Google reviews for both. It seems the ELS has a number of more recent negative reviews. The pandemic doesn\\'t seem to have diminished the desire of NYC developers for hotels. A new building at 150 W. 48th St.between 6th and 7th Aves. will have 3 Hilton hotels: a Hampton Inn, a Home2 Suites, and a Motto. The new Hiltons will have a total 1046 rooms and are expected to open late 2022:\\nhttps://newyorkyimby.com/2021/09/1046-room-hilton-tower-nears-completion-at-150-west-48th-street-in-times-square-manhattan.html We probably lost 10 times that number of rooms from hotels that have shut down the past year and a half.\\nI expect some office buildings will become hotels and apartments This is the trend in hotels. Lots of different brands, often in same building, and fewer of the big 4 star business hotels, like Marriott Marquis and Hilton midtown. We have two brand new hotels in Flushing that have put off their openings for about 1.5 years now. Hotel Indigo is to open \"soon\" and the Renaissance/Trangram is now waiting until March 2022. The second has a saltwater indoor pool that seems an uncommon thing. Moxy hotels are also reproducing. We will see two new ones -- in Lower East Side and in Williamsburg -- next year:\\nhttps://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article117690.html And soon a RIU Plaza at 145 W. 47th\\nhttps://newyorkyimby.com/2021/09/riu-plaza-hotel-nears-completion-at-145-west-47th-street-in-times-square-manhattan.html know it\\'s def not recommended to drive in Manhattan, but I\\'m wondering how difficult it is to drive AND park in the other boroughs? I will be in NJ and before I start my trip in NYC, I will be returning my rental in JFK. I don\\'t have to return it until 6 pm so I\\'m wondering if I can use my rental to explore these boroughs before settling in Manhattan.\\nThanks for your input! I live in Queens and I drive.\\nThe answer is it depends where you are going , Its hard to park in Long Island City, but its very easy to Park in Fresh Meadows. The same with the Bronx, depends on the neighborhood\\nIts easy to park at Pelham Bay Park or van Cortland Park. Not so easy in Soundview Howard is right, it depends on where you are going.\\nAlso, it\\'s the Bronx.\\nAnd another thing to keep in mind, traffic. I am not from there and could tell you more difficult cities to drive in. Sorry, still doing my research on where exactly I will be visiting, but I believe Astoria, sunnyside, woodside, etc. Be aware Queens can be a bit tricky to drive as there is a 50th St, A 50th Ave and a 50th Rd.\\nIf you can get the hang of it or have GPS then you should be ok, Depending where you are going in Queens and the Bronx, Public transportation can be a bit tricky, There are buses that go almost everywhere, but it doesnt mean there are good connections NYC is a major city and the settings can range from extremely dense to something that looks more akin to a residential suburbs. There are parts of Queens and the Bronx that are very drivable and nothing like driving in Manhattan. Then there are parts that are incredibly traffic heavy and may be too intense for some people. A general rule of thumb is the closer you get to Manhattan (even if you are in the outer boroughs) the more intense the traffic will be. Parking can still be difficult even further out in the boroughs if you are not comfortable with city street parking. I\\'ve driven the van wyck many a times when going to/from JFK and I always think of the below scene. This is really an impossible question to answer without knowing your experience/comfort level with driving in urban environments. Just because some people don\\'t have an issue with it doesn\\'t mean you won\\'t. Someone coming from Los Angeles probably isn\\'t going to have much of an issue except in some parts of Manhattan. Someone coming from a small town may not even be comfortable with the outer boroughs. Traffic is also a big factor. Again someone with experience in a place like LA is going to understand sitting in traffic. Someone who only drives in moderate traffic at worst is probably going to be in for a rude awakening if they hit a traffic snarl in NYC. Since you don\\'t mention where you are located it is really difficult to answer the question. Would really help to know what cities you have driven in if any where you felt comfortable. Astoria is going to be more dense than those other neighborhoods.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8AS_tisvQI Astoria Park is easy to park, the rest of Astoria So-So. Same for Sunnyside and Woodside. Its easier to park on a residential street than the main st. That being said Astoria, Sunnywide and Woodside are on the harder side to park IF you are driving in from NJ (?) have you looked at the route options for getting to JFK? Or are you coming from another direction? Depending on time of travel you may not have as much spare time as you hope\\nStreet parking is fairly competitive in the neighborhoods you mentioned (although there are some street metered spaces and small metered municipal parking lots) Be aware NYC has very confusing parking rules, Called Alternte Side of the Street parking, If you find a spot make sure you READ THE SIGNS Thanks for the response! Red259 You make a great point. My husband is a bus driver in Seattle. Not as much traffic and congestion but it\\'s pretty rough nonetheless.\\nEdited: 5:54 pm, September 24, 2021 Five days in mid or late April. It will be her first time in NYC. I\\'m guessing she\\'ll want to spend two days looking at the usual tourist attractions, but other than that we\\'re open to exploring on foot (both competitive endurance athletes) and public transit.\\nHer: Hotel must have an indoor fitness center.\\nMe: Early walks, pastries, coffee, slow breakfast while she sleeps and works out; then I come back and excitedly tell her where she MUST go, ha\\nTA hotel search shows several $300-ish/night with good reviews (maybe that will change when I search for room that are 220+ sq ft).\\nOf the options listed in my subject line, where should we focus to be relatively close to museums yet away from gridlock and being packed like sardines when we\\'re done playing tourist for the day and want to have a quiet evening?\\nOr am I asking too much to have a short direct line to the fun stuff and a quiet, clean, somewhat upscale but not pretentious non-touristy homebase in my price range?\\nEdited: 11:05 am, September 23, 2021 Staying in Chelsea, the Village (don\\'t say Greenwich), LES, SoHo are all good options for being away from the usual tourist attractions. They are all nice neighbourhoods with restaurants, cafes, bars etc.\\nHowever you won\\'t be relatively close to museums if you\\'re thinking of the big ones like The Met, AMNH, Guggenheim, MoMA etc. These are further uptown and will require a subway ride or taxi from those areas.\\nHave you considered the Upper West Side or even a hotel just south of Central Park? These are closer to the big museums but less touristy than say Times Square and Midtown. And your \"quiet evening\" makes me think more of the UWS. It\\'s a big family oriented area though there are locals and families everywhere.\\nMaybe even NoMad, Union Square and the Flatiron district would suit, they\\'re sort of midway between downtown and uptown and have lots of amenities in a less touristy area.\\nYour price range might be good on some days but not others because hotel rates fluctuate. But if you\\'re seeing hotels you like in your price range we can offer opinions. You\\'re expecting too much. As Aynat says, most of the museums are not in those areas and those areas don\\'t have lots of hotels period; add decent sized rooms, an in-house gym for $300/night and you\\'re asking too much. So my advice is don\\'t look at areas but specific hotels that have a gym and decent sized rooms at a price you’re willing to pay. Then look at locations\\nOff the top of my head without checking prices, some ideas\\n-The NoMad hotel in the area of the same name\\n-The Dominick hotel in Soho (good sized rooms and gym that\\'s typically less expensive than it should be because it,s showing wear.\\n-The Affinia Shelburne in midtown with good sized rooms\\nBeekman Tower also in midtown in a residential area with apt style rooms\\nPS while I agree with Aynat that the upper west side might be perfect for you, I don\\'t think any of the hotels there will have a decent gym. The Arthouse and the Beacon are the nicest but I don,t think will meet your requirements.\\nEdited: 10:02 pm, September 23, 2021 Did you look at the Maritime hotel? It’s the north end of the Meatpacking district, so in one direction it’s highly active (with Tao in the hotel) but borders on Chelsea so you can easily find your croissant and things to tell her about . And has a gym. I randomly looked at a few dates in April, $300/night. Plus taxes and fees. So maybe out of budget…maybe busier than you want. Or maybe not. Well that makes it easy: travel partner wants to bring her two teen daughters, and that AIN\\'T ever gonna happen on my watch, ha! Solo NYC in November. Thanks for the input, all! Enjoy the weekend. All are good but probably go with Chelsea area. aaah.. the fitness room / gym thing.. My sister loves to lift, and the hotel gyms are pointless for her, so really depends on what is needed.\\nSome hotels will have a relationship with a local gym, but my sister found that some gyms in NYC will offer day passes cheaply, or a 1 day free trial. My sister has used \"Crunch Fitness\" before.\\nI wouldn\\'t limit your hotel search to places with a fitness room, but search around the local area...\\nM With the change in plans, a gym is out of the search. Makes it much easier! As you search for yourself, you might check the Giraffe Hotel, the Park South, both on lower Park Ave. It\\'s a relatively quiet area but there are lots of good restaurants nearby and good subway connections.. easy walk to Chelsea. L\\'Express is a bistro open 24/7 that\\'s a great place for breakfast or any meal. The Giraffe includes coffee, other drinks and snacks in the lobby 24/7. Hello. We will be traveling to New York mid next month and want to make sure we have the vaccine documentation we need. We are both vaccinated, I have uploaded our information into the NYC Covid Safe app and also have my information downloaded to the Common Pass app. Is this sufficient or do we need to carry our Vaccine Cards as well? We can do that but we prefer to leave them home as this is part of a month long road trip down the east coast to Florida and we would rather not take the risk of losing the vaccine cards as we travel. What do you advise, carry the cards or is the app enough? Thanks so much. The app is enough. You can also take a pic of the card and show that along with ID. Ditto ter. I would keep your own photo of your card, front and back on your phone in case you can’t access the internet. And keep your phone charged! Take photos or copies. I had mine reduced to credit card size on a copy machine and laminated it. As a backup, in case something happens to your phone, I would bring paper photocopies of the cards, which are also accepted. Shouldn\\'t need the card as a domestic traveler so I wouldn\\'t risk taking it. I would take photos of the front and back to keep in my phone as mentioned above. I use an app and every single place I have showed it accepted it. If someone was travelling across international borders that would be different. California has a state vaccination app, similar to the NY State Excelsior Pass, right?\\nOur niece from LA is now living with us in NYC while attending grad school at Columbia Univ., and when we go out with her to places that require proof of vaccination she just shows her California vaccination app when we show our NY State Excelsior Passes. No issue anywhere,\\nGood idea to also keep screen shots of your CDC cards on your phone, in case you need to show that; but no one in NYC has ever asked to see our original CDC cards.\\n(The original CDC cards stay home in our passport cases and only leave the house when we travel internationally. We use the copies on our phones and/or our NY State Excelsior Passes for everything else. No problem.) Thanks. Yes, we have the CA app. Sounds like we’ll be fine. Thanks again. We came across a price almost too good to be true, and many of the reviews are from 1 Contribution members. It reminded us of some Asian boutique hotels that, upon arrival, were so hilariously NOT what the TA reviews and fake pictures were that we actually stayed in one just for a night of laughs/memories. Dare I just barely a bed and shower.\\nIs Hotel Mimosa \"real\"? The price, the reviews, the website, everything. Looks like a hostel but with private shower. Or is this a case of a hidden gem? On a map it looks v v close to the Manhattan Bridge so likely to be noisy The Mimosa is a 6 story hotel with six rooms per floor above the ground level or 30 rooms altogether. It likely caters to visitors from China. As mentioned, it is right by the approach ramp to the Manhattan Bridge.\\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/@40.714099,-73.9939392,3a,75y,67.07h,116.64t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5W5Qi89HeIIHfDbuW6Y0sA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en Is it currently open?\\nThere aren’t recent reviews. Just pre-Covid.\\nIt’s listed as a 2-star property. So even with the “ rave “ reviews, keep that in mind. Look at the Allen hotel which has more recent reviews and may be around the same price. I stayed there pre-Covid and really enjoyed it. It looks really close to the bridge, but actually the soundproofing was fantastic. I had stayed once at the Hotel 91 around the corner where the bridge noise was insane, this place was so much better. I loved the neighborhood and the hotel.... This is free, but timed tickets are required as are masks.\\nThe main branch at 42 and Fifth has a one room exhibit of treasures from the collection. You will see rare and valuable things. The real Winnie the Pooh teddy bear, for instance. Bibles. You can see the beautiful building, too. Allow 30 mins. Please. No less. Thanks for the reminder, it does look good.\\nIt was recently mentioned here: https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13683732-Polonsky_Treasures_at_the_NY_Public_Library_Schwarzman-New_York_City_New_York.html Hope to see this soon! Would like to work this in to our trip, especially since our hotel is very close. Gotta take another look at the itinerary! So we are looking at spending five nights in New York in late October/early November. We are a family of five - our children are ages 5, 3 and 1. I am looking at holiday apartments/homes and have found a couple in Brooklyn (Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant in particular). I have also seen a couple in Jersey City. What are these areas like to stay in from a safety perspective and also from a practicality perspective?\\nWe will be wanting to see the key NYC sites (Central Park, Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero, e.t.c…) and are happy to use the metro. We are unlikely to be out late at night (the children have put an end to that!) but will probably eat dinner out every night and then travel back to wherever we are staying.\\nDo any of the above areas sound reasonable for us or could someone suggest where might be good? We have been looking more central but we are wondering if we are best going away from the main tourist areas to get more for our money.\\nFinally, it looks like we will be away over Halloween. Is there somewhere that might be good to take our children trick or treating so they can experience it American style? Is there any particular etiquette we need to be aware of?\\nThanks! I mean subway not metro. I’ve been up all night with a sick baby. Manhattan is where you want to be staying IMO, the vast majority of \"holiday homes\" are illegal in NYC, due to a law that doesn\\'t allow short term vacation rentals - if you haven\\'t read up on this topic, there are plenty of posts, including this one https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-c147344/New-York-City:New-York:Vacation.Apartment.Rentals.html. Also, you don\\'t want to be spending time travelling when you could be sightseeing.\\nThere are quieter places in Manhattan, such as the Upper West Side, or Lower Manhattan where you can get away from hectic places like Times Square etc.\\nDates are key also to assist us finding legal accommodation that will work for you.\\nAre you looking at October this year? The US Border doesn\\'t open until \"Early November\" so unless you have US passports, you won\\'t get in.\\nM With kids that small, look at the Upper West Side, near Central Park and a few kid friendly things. Staying out of Manhattan with tiny kids means too much travel time.\\nAvoid any kind of holiday rental, too many tears have been shed over those on arrival.\\nThe Beacon Hotel is very family friendly, and has kitchenettes and two good grocery shops across the street. Great for snacks, or even in room dining, as they have tons of prepared food. Think picnics in central Park.\\nDo pack layers for the kids late Oct can be brisk. Though like Mark, I assume you mean 2022.\\nEdited: 7:50 am, September 30, 2021 This is for 2022, right? Will the kids be 2, 4, and 6 then?\\nI agree with what\\'s been said above -- you should stay in Manhattan and you should avoid holiday rentals because they are almost all illegal (especially in Manhattan).\\nI live in Manhattan with 4 children aged 3, 4, 5, and 5. When we travel we get connecting hotel rooms -- either just 2 regular rooms that interconnect or a 1-bedroom suite that connects to a regular hotel room. It\\'s usually difficult to tell which hotels offer this. My advice is to narrow down a few choices in Manhattan and then contact the hotels to ask about connecting rooms.\\nThis is a thread from Halloween 2019 that gives you an idea of Halloween activities in non-pandemic times:\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12936068-NYC_Events_for_Halloween_2019_please_keep_adding-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nI didn\\'t update is last year and haven\\'t had time to even think about doing so this year. Next year, assuming life is pretty normal again, it\\'ll almost certainly get an update :)\\nHave fun planning and good luck! The TRYP hotel has family rooms and there are also lots of hotel options with suites. I like to use Hotels.com to search. Make sure you put in 2 adults and 3 kids and that will help narrow your options to rooms that will work for you. Definitely stay in Manhattan. You don’t want to be traveling on the subway with a stroller any further than you have to. It will not be worth the time and effort to get in and out of the city each day with kids. Hotel, hotel, hotel, and yes, in Manhattan. Know that hotel rates at the time you’re talking about coming are high because of Halloween and the first Sunday in November is the NYC Marathon which brings thousands to compete (and fill hotel rooms). While I agree the UWS is ideal, that area is also prime for people running the Marathon since it ends there. The least expensive decent hotel in the area that could work for you is the Newton which has rooms with 2 queen beds (like UK kings) and a sofabed.\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nMentioned above has suites of various sizes with kitchens like serviced apartments.\\nI\\'m assuming you’re on a budget if you’re looking at out of Manhattan accommodation. People are steering you away from that not just because of the chance for illegal rentals (which breed the opportunity for scams) but because with kids that young, you will definitely want to be able to go “home” easily for rests, naps etc. once upon a time Jersey City near a PATH train (like a subway connecting Jersey City and Hoboken to Manhattan) was a way around rental laws in NYC. But I believe Jersey City then passed a law making short term rentals illegal too.\\nWhile there may be some legal rentals in Brooklyn, any building with more than 3 units can\\'t be rented short term legally. My best advice is pick different dates when rates are lower. Later in November is usually cheaper and Xmas decorations go up at Thanksgiving (the 4 th Thursday of the month) and are ar more fun for kids than Halloween,\\nEdited: 4:57 pm, September 30, 2021 \"any building with more than 3 units can\\'t be rented short term legally\"\\nIt\\'s illegal in any building with more than 2 units. I raised a child in NYC and agree it is the best place to trick or treat. You can do this in a high rise with no weather worries. However, unless you live in the building, you won’t be permitted to do so. Also the Greenwich Village Halloween Parade is more adult and perhaps more like Key West so I cannot recommend it either. Perhaps your children would enjoy wearing costumes and you ( or hotel desk) can give them candy. I know wearing a fur coat is kinda off, but it really keeps me warm and I like the style. I\\'ll never buy a new fur.\\nI\\'ve been considering Ritz Furs cause they\\'ve been there for so long and the reviews are good. Any suggestions?\\nMy budget is about ＄800 or below, but can raise it if I really adore what I see. Bought a lovely, full-length mink coat with less than 400 dollars in NJ, so not hoping to spend a hell lot.\\nThank you :)) I thought Ritz Furs went out of business. Do you know where they are now? I can remember their TV ads from years ago, when they were on W 57th St. Sorry, I have no ideas other than perhaps charity shops. Fur is so out of favor, but when an old, fur-loving lady dies, her furs must go somewhere.\\nCall the charity Housing Works and ask if they get fur. A lot of the high-end stuff they get is auctioned online, rather than in one of their shops.\\nI think there are still a couple of high-end general resale shops on the Upper East Side, so you might want to research them and see if they get fur.\\nI would also look online, like on Ebay. I was recently doing some research on a now defunct dept store in San Francisco, where I used to live. In my search results I got all sorts of stuff on Ebay with that store\\'s labels, including a couple of fur pieces. One was one of those things women wrapped around their necks and shoulders in the 40s and 50s that consisted of a whole small animal from head to tail! I just looked online and see that Ritz is now on W 29th St. That is really interesting as that area in the high W 20s used to be, not that long ago, the heart of the \"fur district.\" It\\'s amazing how quickly things can change. Because fur is so out of favor here, I\\'m not sure NYC is the best place to look. But since you live so close, come in and check out Ritz. I agree with Grandrue the upper east side is also a good place to look, but I would call a few places first and ask about stock and prices.\\nFur is considered more ok down south. If you have any trips planned down south, you might do better...Atlanta, Nashville parts of Florida and Texas if you can\\'t find what you want here. When I looked at ebay listings last night, I couldn\\'t help notice that a fair amount of it seemed to be listed by people in places like Florida and Texas. Hi all. I wonder if any one can tell me how to find the event calendar for church fairs and festivals for Christmas ..we go to all the holiday markets but also the church ones as well but they don\\'t seem to be advitised this year . Much appreciate any help thank you sue Grace Church is having a Christmas Fair in November: https://www.clwac.org/event-4367009\\nThere are a couple of churches mentioned on this website about street fairs and festivals. Do a search for \"church\". They were past year\\'s church fairs though. It could be that the website hasn\\'t been updated yet for this year, or the church fairs won\\'t be on this year.:\\nhttps://newyorkled.com/nyc_events_Street_Fairs/\\nEventbrite also lists a lot of Christmas related fairs of all sorts: https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/christmas-fair/\\nThis website has a list of Holiday Fairs, it lists Crafts at St John The Divine: https://trip101.com/article/christmas-markets-in-nyc\\nWe also have a Top Question (from 2016, but churches should be the same) about \"Music in Sacred Places\" in which the churches listed may also hold Christmas Fairs, but you\\'d need to wade through the list and find a website for each of the churches to see what upcoming events they may have:\\nhttps://newyorkled.com/nyc_events_Street_Fairs/\\nWe also have a Top Question about a church tour someone wanted to do (from 2016), where they created a map of the significant churches, this could also be used as a starting point. See post #16 for a map of churches they created, it\\'s pretty good: https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k10014461-o10-Church_tour_in_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html I\\'m attempting to take my mother on a long overdue, extended weekend to NYC in Dec. The main focus of our trip will be viewing the holiday decorations, shopping, maybe a show and obviously eating. The issue I\\'m having is finding out any info. on whether or not she will be allowed indoors to dine or even be able to stay in a hotel. I am vaccinated, but she has a medical exception to the vaccine requirement due to anaphylaxis. Will her medical exemption and a negative test result allow her to travel? I cannot seem to find anything about this specific situation on the NYC Health website but maybe I am just not seeing it. Found by a simple google search\\n“What medical conditions are exempt from the COVID-19 vaccine?\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the only people who shouldn\\'t get vaccinated are those who had a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, immediately after a first vaccine dose or to a component of the COVID-19 vaccine.”\\nIf either of those is the case for your Mother, you,d probably need some official paperwork to prove it, but I don\\'t know what. Frankly, it sounds like more trouble than it,s worth, but you may not agree. I don\\'t believe that the mandate includes hotels....though there is talk about some hotels asking for proof. Easiest way is to call prior to booking.\\n**Will her medical exemption and a negative test result allow her to travel? **\\nThat is probably a question for the airline.\\nIf you mean will she be allowed to enter indoor places that the mandate covers....I see nothing currently that would make me say yes.\\nEdited: 2:43 pm, September 30, 2021 Thank for the replies. I had found this same Google info. thatnywhiz quoted. We do have \"official\" paperwork ( a letter from her physician). American Airlines will allow her to travel and I\\'ve found hotels to be accommodating.\\nI suppose I should have been more specific and asked if anyone knew if there were any exceptions to the mandate for people in similar situations who would like to attend a show or dine indoors.\\nAs far as being more trouble than it\\'s worth, I guess that would be up to the traveller. Without going to details, my family has had a pretty tough year (as have a lot of families) and I feel like a change of scenery and some of my mother\\'s favorite reasons to smile (art, theatre and shopping) are definitely in order and worth it if the laws will allow it. This is what I would do....\\nI would call the specific places/restaurants/attractions and cite the CDC exemption for the vaccine and ask if they will accommodate. Same with restaurants.\\nI can see some saying now. As many forged vaccine cards that are out there, it would be even easier...or just as easy...to forge a letter from a doctor. Heck....kids have been doing that for years. The \"reasonable accommodation\" language of does not seem to address your situation https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page\\nSince these are city imposed rules on indoor or the activities I\\'d try contacting them for clarification https://www1.nyc.gov/home/contact-us.page\\nEdited: 3:11 pm, September 30, 2021 Some individual hotels have requirements for vax, but not a lot as far as I know. But they do all require wearing masks.\\nI don\\'t know if restaurants have alternatives to proof of vax. Some of them take children under 12 with proof of negative result on test within past 48 or 72 hours, but don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen that described as alternative for unvaccinated adults. You should ask.\\nSome venues, like theaters, MAY have vax alternatives, but, in my experience, you have to contact them in advance in writing.\\nIf you want easier travel for your mother (and I think we all do)I suggest you think about encouraging some of your fellow Texans to get vaccinated, wear masks, and elect someone who promotes the same. Alternatively, suggest they all go out and party together, give each other COVID, and maybe we can achieve herd immunity and get out of this mess that way. There is a medical exception for Broadway shows - she must have a negative PCR test within 72 hours of the show or a negative antigen test within 6 hours. I would check the site for whichever show you were considering. (Note that the Broadway vaccination requirement has been extended to January now)\\nhttps://www.broadway.org/info/covid-19-updates/ I won The $10 lottery tickets to Hamilton for the Sunday 3pm showing. We love Hamilton, so my husband and I are planning a last minute trip. We arrive this Friday at 3pm, leaving Monday. We do better when we have a plan of what to do each day, and would like some help.\\nHere is what I do have planned:\\n- flights arrive at jfk at 3pm on Friday, depart From EWR at 11am Monday\\n- Staying at Hyatt Centric Times Square on points\\n- Saturday 9am Statue of Liberty general admission\\n- Saturday 1:30 9/11 museum and tour\\n-Sunday 3pm Hamilton\\nWhat I need to fill in\\n- best way to travel to /from airport\\n- best way to get from hotel to battery park by 9am\\n- what to do Friday evening\\n- what to do Saturday evening\\n- what to do Sunday morning\\n- where to grab lunch before 9/11 tour\\n- any suggested restaurants and if we need reservations ( we prefer more casual dining)\\nI was trying to fit in a Hamilton walking tour but have not had much luck finding one that did not overlap with our plans. Is there a good self-guided audio tour?\\nThanks in advance for any suggestions! - best way to travel to /from airport\\n**Someone always would reply to this question that the best way is by limo with champagne. Are you on a budget? If not, take a taxi.\\n- best way to get from hotel to battery park by 9am\\n**Subway. You could take the 1 train from TS down. Check the weekend schedules/changes at:\\nhttp://web.mta.info/weekender/subwaydiagram.html\\n- what to do Friday evening\\n- what to do Saturday evening\\n- what to do Sunday evening\\n**Specific interests? You will likely be out of the 9/11 Museum close to 5. Have dinner outside somewhere and enjoy the early fall weather. I,d say best way to travel to/from airport depends on budget, preference and amount of luggage. Easiest is taxi which will be ~$75 with toll and tip for driver. (Fixed fare of $52 plus toll and tip). You can also use AirTrain/subway for ~$8/person. Use google maps for exact directions. On the way back to EWR I would not use a NYC taxi. I\\'d use a car service like\\nCarmellimo.com\\nDial7.com\\nOr use the train. Again google maps will give you exact directions.\\nSubway is fastest to Battery Park but you can also take a taxi. Again google maps will estimate time to travel both ways.\\nLook at\\nFreetoursbyfoot.com\\nand see if they have a self guided Hamilton walking tour.\\nWalkingthebigapple.com\\nalso has self guided walks.\\nYou could visit Hamilton Grange if you have the time on Sunday morning. Otherwise a nice brunch and a walk near your brunch.\\nFor the evenings, I,d look at seeing some jazz but you may have no interest. Another show? A cruise?\\nEdited: 2:34 pm, September 30, 2021 We originally booked our trip to new york in Feb 2020 - for obvious reasons its was delayed and moved across to 2021.\\nWe\\'re due to travel from the UK on 14th December and stay until 21st December.\\nit\\'s looking likely this will now be okay thanks to the UK being allowed to travel from November with a double vaccination.\\nI\\'m just wondering, how \"Normal\" is new york at the moment?. i know things will not be the same for a long time but is everything pretty much ok ? We\\'re coming to do the usual tourist attractions: 9/11 museum, times square, empire state, statue of liberty, broadway etc etc.. as well as experience new york at xmas..\\nIts a big trip and we\\'re due to pay in the next 2 weeks so just wanted to find out peoples opinions, i\\'d rather not wait another year to visit but wanted to check. I went to New York in August after an almost 2 year absence (way too long). As far as attractions, I went to the MET where I had previously purchased a timed ticket and waited in line for about 20 minutes before the doors opened (I had a 10am entry).\\nThere are fewer tourists in places such as Central Park, the Charging Bull and the 9/11 Memorial, for example, but that will most likely change when the borders reopen for Europe.\\nI did notice quite a few restaurants closed in Times Square but that is to be expected.\\nI showed me proof of vaccination and ID at a few locations to eat inside and I wore a mask in stores.\\nAs a tourist, I can tell you that New York City and its residents are still as magnificent as ever. From your other thread:\\nIt\\'s pretty normal...in my opinion. The city has been crowded over the summer with people out and about doing things.\\nWhat you do need to consider is that you are coming in Dec. Check the entry requirements for any indoor activities and be sure that you have proof of vaccination to take part in many of them.\\nOutside of that, come and enjoy! Hello fellow TAers! I will be flying in to JFK and would like to do some exploring in Queens before heading to my hotel in Manhattan. Some of the areas in Queens that were recommended to us are Astoria, Woodside, Sunnyside and flushing Chinatown, and Jackson heights. Is it possible to visit all these areas in a day? (I will probably have my luggage so it will prob slow us down a bit.) I could possibly make another \"half-day\" visit on another day if extra time is needed. We\\'re both extreme foodies so we\\'re mostly visiting to eat, window shop and take in the culture. We love Asian food but always happy to try other types of food.\\nAlso, in regard to the Bronxs area, are there any other \"foodie areas/districts\" besides Little Italy? yes, but you would need a better internary and a good idea where you are going without getting lost You could visit all those areas in a day, but maybe not while carrying luggage (and how much luggage will you be carrying, anyhow?). And - my two cents - you don’t have to, since they’re all easily accessible from Manhattan. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that because you’re landing at JFK and JFK is in Queens, you need to explore all of Queens on your way from the airport.\\nI would pick at most one area to stop at to do some food exploration to whet your appetite for the city. For example, when I fly into/out of LaGuardia, I often build in time for a meal or snack in Jackson Heights - luggage & all. You could do that too, or given your interest in Asian food, you might want to head for Flushing instead.\\nAs for the Bronx - it’s somewhat underrepresented in this forum, but there’s certainly good & interesting food there outside of Arthur Avenue. Think of who the immigrants are in the Bronx - Dominicans, Jamaicans, West Africans, Mexicans - and that will give you a sense of what to look for. But I’m not sure there are big concentrations of restaurants in specific areas; my impression is they’re more scattered. I agree with Linda E re the luggage.\\nThis thread about the 7 train is useful for planning a day in Queens.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k7919191-Take_a_Ride_on_the_7_train-New_York_City_New_York.html Thanks for your input! My bf and I will be traveling with a rolling bag and backpack. We kind of have our itinerary set. We were hoping to visit Queens in one day, but I can try to play around with my itinerary if need be. In our day trip from Manhattan to Queens we visited\\n- Jackson Heights to see the Jackson Heights Historic District and the shopping streets near the subway station\\n- Flushing for lunch and to see the historical area,\\n- Flushing Meadows and Corona Park - including time in the Queens Museum of Art (don\\'t miss the amazing Panorama of the City of New York if you go there)\\n- and a final stop at Long Island City to see the sunset (we were there in December so sunset was at 4.30pm -ish, which cut short the day but was absolutely worth it.....\\nAll on the 7 train....\\nEdited: 8:52 pm, September 29, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 1:29 am, September 30, 2021\\nEdited: 1:29 am, September 30, 2021 Sorry wanted to edit my post but somehow just reposted it,,......so that\\'s the deleted post.\\nI wanted to say that I used that website about the 7 train that is in the thread I linked above to plan the day. It provides so much information about what to see and do there.\\nhttps://www.tripsavvy.com/tour-queens-via-the-7-subway-2819477\\nHave a great time. Thanks for the link! I will check it out to get more info :) The fact that you want to sightsee in Queens, with luggage, before going to your hotel in Manhattan makes me think your impressions of the city are skewed. The first thing I always do when I fly in is head straight to my hotel to check in and/or drop off luggage.\\nThen I go exploring. I have kind of a motto, that everything in the City takes longer than you think, so I never overplan. You can definitely see all of those areas in one day via subway from your hotel. The unknown factor is how long will you want to explore each area so don’t be set to a rigid schedule. Drop off the luggage first. The luggage will be cumbersome and will slow down you down when you will be dodging foot traffic in Queens esp. in crowded Flushing and Jackson Heights. The stairs on the subways will make the luggage a major hassle. You will not be able to see or do as much with luggage. https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/videos-musicians-hosting-joyful-diy-performances-fire-escapes-harlem/\\nIn a totally different way, it reminds me of the stretch of Ft Greene(Lafayette Ave) during the NYC Marathon. A impromptu block party breaks out as the race is being run and especially after a great many of the runners have gone past.\\nA live DJ, who starts playing first thing in the AM, keeps the party going. The electric slide and other dances are performed by close to 100 people in the middle of the street!\\nThe cops let everything go until right up to the time that the permit(for the DJ) runs out. I lived right in that area and still to this day spend marathon day there...even though I now live 10 min away.\\nNYC!\\nEdited: 5:25 pm, September 29, 2021 fun article. thanks for sharing. I loved this, ter. It is absolutely one of those things that make NYC great, and what I try to explain to those that just don’t get it about my passion for New York.\\nThe Ft. Greene area you mention sounds amazing for the Marathon. Would love to take that in some time.\\nThank you for the joyful NYC start to my morning today! 🗽😀 🎶😎 You are very welcome to both of you! We are from Canada and planning a trip to NYC next month. Have any other Canadians travelled to NYC since proof of vaccination has been required for indoor dining and broadway? Since the standardized proof of vaccination from the Canadian government is still not available, I just wanted to make sure our provincial vaccination documents will be sufficient. Go to the Montreal board and search out poster jcmtl, she travelled to NYC this summer. You can send her a direct message. Or you will see her posts in the NYC board earlier, probably some today.\\nEdited: 1:29 pm, September 28, 2021 Yes, our fellow Montrealer went before the proof of vaccine came into effect.l am going next week and expect to have no issues using the Ontario vax certificates. I will report back. I haven’t seen any posts by fellow Albertans, so I will be curious to know how you do. (I’m assuming everything will be fine.) I do wish we had something with a QR code, or something more “official” looking. Please report back if you think of it. Your proof will work just fine. As mentioned by MeeMee I did travel to New York in August after they required proof of vaccination in restaurants. However, we didn\\'t have the VaxiCode in Quebec yet.\\nI did prepare by having a copy the vaccination proof document on my phone and was able to access restaurants without any issues.\\nI now have VaxiCode on my phone and cannot imagine this being an issue as the same information you found on the paper is now on the app. We don\\'t have apps or other fancy stuff in Nova Scotia yet, just a certificate you can print out that lists info for both of your vaccination shots. Would I be able to show that, either a print-out, or a picture on my phone? I didn\\'t have the fancy app when I went, I did however have a copy of my paper copy on my phone and it was sufficient with a photo ID card. When I went to the museum I saw people with the paper copy itself. LadyA, in case you haven\\'t checked recently, when you print your proof of vaccination, you can now select credit card sized. I printed several and had them laminated. You can, that is, if you have the big bucks, according to the NY Times:\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/2021/9/29/22700073/eleven-madison-park-vegan-nyt-review-meat-room We are coming to New York for Thanksgiving week, does anybody know if there will be any ice skating at Central Park or anywhere else?\\nMany thanks In the past, Central Park, Bryant Park, Rockefeller Center, Prospect Park, and a few other places would probably be open during your trip.\\nJust monitor the locations you are interested in to confirm 2021 opening dates. When the 2021 FAQ for Thanksgiving is posted, I\\'m certain that ice skating will be included. Keep checking the right hand side of the screen for when it is posted. The Bryant Park ice skating should definitely be open, they usually open at the end of October. Hopefully this year included. It\\'s one of the prettiest locations with the stalls and the big Christmas tree there.\\nThey haven\\'t updated their website yet, but keep an eye on it: https://bryantpark.org/amenities/the-rink The Central Park rink is bigger than Bryant Park and they opened mid November in past years, so you should be fine. Keep an eye on their website too:\\nhttps://www.wollmanskatingrink.com/ ***The Central Park rink is bigger than Bryant Park and they opened mid November in past years***\\nWollman Rink is usually open in late October. Saw an article last month saying Wollman Rink will open sometime in November. Yeah, this year may be different, but in the past, late October was the norm. Last year it opened Mid-November, not sure about the years before that. Looks like this year could be a November opening again.\\nEdited: 11:43 pm, September 29, 2021 Past years it was late October. This past Sunday I went up the West Side of the Hudson Valley to New Paltz, This side generally does not get discussed much here except Woodbury Common. This side might actually be nicer than the east side , which is easier to get to by train. You really will have to have a car to get there. It also seemed more crowded than the east side,maybe because it was a perfect Summer/Fall day (Leaves really hadnt changed yet)\\nThe countryside on the west side of the Hudson is really nice and the drive up to New Paltz was fairly easy\\nMy first stop was the Rosendale rail trestly trail (Otherwise known as the Wallkil valley rail trail) I just walked the trail over the bridge and to the bottom of the bridge. The trestle is 940 feet long and there is a parking lot across from a church (The lot is some sort of municipal lot and its free)\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CUTkDIdrCOv/\\nThis place must be awesome in a few weeks, but I heard it was really crowded then, but it still had amazing views.\\nThere are 2 main open areas here Mohonk Preserve and Minnewasaka State park, it seems they have similar histories as being owned by a wealthy family and donated to land conservation.Mohonk Preserve costs $15 a person and Minniwasaka costs $10 a car. I had been to Mohonk before and wanted to go to Minniwasaka as I heard good things about it.\\nOn the way to Minniwasaka (which pasts Mohonk Preserve) I saw a Farm stand, the Wallkill valley farm stands, these things are pretty common upstate so I decided to stop and get some fresh local produce, Unfortunatly it seems the place had been flooded by Hurricane Ida a few weeks ago and the produce wasnt as local as I would have liked.\\ndriving towards Minniwasaka I saw the Gatehouse to Mohonk Preserve, While you are not allowed to park in a photo spot I did anyway and got a nice picture.\\nI got to Minniwasaka Park and my first stop was Awosting Falls .\\nIts about a 1 mile round trip hike to see awosting falls, its about 60 feet high\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CUTnsLSLQd9/\\nWhile on the hike I spoke to other hikers and they said I should go to the lake. There is a brand new visitor center at the lake and decided to walk around the lake, its an old carriage road (as is the hike to Awosting falls). Its about 2 miles around the lake.\\nThis hike was a gem, as you can see from this picture, it doesnt get much better than this\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CUTnVt7Lxsv/\\nand IMO was nicer than Awosting falls which was my original goal, Ive seen picutres from this spot with the leaves and its almost iconic, I was told its almost impossible to get into this park at peak leafing season. There were certainly plenty of people here on this beautiful early fall day\\nI then decided to stop at Woodbury Common on the way back , you past it on the way back to the city, I had not been there in a while and let me tell you , this place was PACKED, it was wall to wall people. I have no idea where all these people came from but it was busier than any mall I had seen since covid.\\nThe ride home was terrible, I decided to be cheap and take the Bear Mountain Bridge instead of the Tappan Zee because the toll is $1.45 instead of $12. Took my almost 4 hours to get home from Woodbury Common (its about 60 MIles from my house, it took less than 2 hours to get to New Paltz earlier) , it took almost 90 mins to get from Woodbury Common to the Bear Mountain bridge, which is only like 10 miles and I had to suffer with a Jets game on the radio\\nHere are more pictures of the area, as you can see its beautiful there.\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/oElzAtu I should add if you dont want to drive from the city, you can take the train to Poughkeepsie and rent a car from there, New Paltz is about half and hour from there, You can also take a bus from the Port Authoriity to New Paltz directly, I guess you could uber once you get there (Just stick to Minnewasaka State Park or Monhonk Preserve) ** I had not been there in a while and let me tell you , this place was PACKED, it was wall to wall people. I have no idea where all these people came from but it was busier than any mall I had seen since covid.**\\nThey come up from the city and the surrounding areas.\\nNice weather, back to school shopping, tourists, local shoppers, etc...... -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 5:16 pm, September 29, 2021 Gorgeous pictures! Thanks for the report. Other than the return trip, sounds like a perfect day. Beautiful photos Howard.\\nWhen I go (rarely) to WC, I drive around to the far side and park near the Off Fifth. I only shop in that little section. It’s always filled w Japanese tourists carrying bags from the Prada store. It’s pretty funny. With all the lousy weather we had this summer, it was nice to have a perfect day. Its a nice area. Not sure anyone from the west would be wowed but for us locals its as good as it gets. One cool thing you can do next time, preferably in October, is book lunch at the Mohonk Mountain House, and hike the area. This is the house featured on the show Upload\\nI think you mean Wallkill View Farm Market. Its a cool little market actually. Nice bakery inside, jams, etc.\\nThat Minniwasaka lake has some very cool picnic spots. Its a pleasant walk around the lake, but some of the hikes off it can be a little rough. You missed Sam\\'s point, but you hit the highlight\\nCheck out Storm King Art Center next time if you havent, and Innisfree Garden on the east side Someone from the west would be more wowed by the Adirondacks and the road from Elizabethtown to Keene, A similar feeling to drving near Denver except you re next to the Ausable River.\\nThe Farm market was baking, it smelled awesome I definatly think Minnewasaka is in top 5 New York state Park (Not counting Adirondacks or Catskills as they arent normal parks)\\nJust my List\\n1. Niagara Falls\\n2. Watkins Glen\\n3 Taghonack Falls State Park\\n4. Long Island Beaches State Park (There are several, just pick one Like Jones Beach or Robert Moses)\\n5. Lake Minnewasaka State Park New Paltz is also an interesting place. I can\\'t remember the story behind the interesting stone residential architecture there. Did it have something to do with Huguenots? I also recommend Storm King art center, especially in weather like we\\'re having right now. Myself and my husband are travelling from Ireland to NY for my 40th birthday in December 2021 for 4 nights. We are staying at the Bryant Park hotel.\\nMy actual birthday is the 11th and I would really like to do something special for it that night.\\nA friend of mine recommended a dinner cruise but I worry it might be too cold.\\nIve looked at both The Rainbow room at the Rockefeller and River Cafe and I think both are fab.\\nI\\'m just wondering if any one has any other recommendations on somewhere really nice to go ? Budget, I suppose $250 per person would be our max. Location, anywhere we can get a cab to from our hotel.\\nAlso any recommendations for a nice rooftop bar/restaurant for another night out ? Or is it too cold for Rooftop bars in December.\\nThanks in advance ! Everyone is different, so i can only tell you what I would want for a special birthday.\\nMy #1 choice would be Saga - brand new, reviews aren’t in. But it is intriguing to me. I love their restaurant on the ground floor of the same building. It’s on the 63rd floor of 70 Pine St and it’s $245pp. . https://www.saga-nyc.com/.\\nThere’s also a rooftop bar there called Overstory.\\nSomething that may be fun w good views is at Hudson Yards, Electric Lemon - haven’t been yet. Maybe go for brunch. https://electriclemonnyc.com/#about\\nOtherwise, as a non-meat eater, in that budget, my preferences would be Le Bernadin or one of the excellent Omakase restaurants…there are a few of that interests you.\\nIf you want more of a party environment, go to the second seating at Hasalon. It is reopening next week. It’s an Israeli style restaurant but at the second seating, there’s music and dancing. https://www.hasalonnyc.com/\\nEdited: 9:39 am, September 29, 2021 Thanks so much Risa L, Ill take a look at all of those options ! Have a very happy birthday! (And hope you report back on your adventures). Afaik, the Rainbow Room is only doing private events. Bar 65 used to be open to the public but is now also only doing private events. That might change in December. If it does, having drinks there one night would be great.\\nThe boats that do dinner cruises have heated cabins but the food is not as good as what you,d get in a restaurant. You might consider doing a cruise on another day with\\nSail-nyc.com\\nin one of their yachts which have cabins with lots of glass. They do sunset cruises and various Xmas themed cruises.\\nAs for a restaurant, Risa keeps up with the newest places. I happen to be a fan of the River Cafe, but I haven\\'t been there since pre pandemic and the food is more classic.\\nWherever you decide, make sure they know it,s your birthday. Hope it,s great!\\nEdited: 11:01 am, September 29, 2021 Do you have any food preferences - likes or dislikes? My personal favourite (that we have booked for my delayed 40th) is Keens Steakhouse. Been going for years and never had a bad steak and always had excellent service. It’s also walkable from your hotel (probably 10 mins if walking fairly slowly) One of my favorites in the category of \\'special occasion\\' restaurants is Marea. This is if you like fish and seafood, with Italian flavors. Which ticks MY boxes when it comes to food. I like Marea too, excellent food, very pretty room.\\nAnd #7 is why personal preference is so important. If someone took me to a steakhouse for a special birthday, I would call in sick. When I have to go to a steakhouse with friends for any reason, I grit my teeth and paste a smile on. But it is never enjoyable for me (although I\\'ve had fun at the bar at Mastro\\'s as they have a great wines by the glass list). So, think about what YOU want and if you have more questions, or more specifics, feel free to refine your needs! I like The Modern next to the Museum of Modern Art. If you like, they can do a table for 2 in the kitchen. Otherwise, ask for a window to see the sculpture garden of the museum. Danny Meyer runs a good spot. Robert at Museum of Art and Design has an excellent view of Central Park. Enjoy. Any advice about what to do and where to eat in Manhattan over the Christmas and New Year period please? We have been a good few times so done all the “standard” tourist attractions - but not visited at this time of the year so looking for unusual places (a bit out of the ordinary) or specific to the time of year?\\nThere are 7 of us (15, 18, 21 and 3 adults)\\nNew Years Eve in particular- will they be doing the ball drop in Times Sq this year does anyone know? Or what other options are there? Are there fireworks anywhere for instance?\\nWe have rented an AirBnB up by Central Park so most places easy for us to get to 😁 Be aware that the majority of AirBnB Style short term apartment rentals are illegal in all five boroughs of NYC\\nThey are illegal in any residential building with three or more units. The only potentially legal ones are in one or two family houses - which are uncommon in areas that are desirable or convenient for visitors https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/articles/liz-krueger/answers-new-yorkers-concerned-or-confused-about-illegal-hotel-law and https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/about-illegal-short-term-rentals.page\\nThe source of the offer does not matter - the legal classification of the building does. No internet middleman, even otherwise respectable or well known ones, vets listings for compliance with local laws, leaving visitors vulnerable.\\nTo get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station (OR if driving and need parking - directions of travel) and 4) hotel budget.

Kaye know what she is talking about. My boyfriend and I are heading to New York for new year. We are both into the more quirky places to eat and drink. Just wondered where people would recommend eating/drinking. We are staying for 4 nights so would like plenty of options.\\nWe also prefer things that are not too touristy and more local.\\nOpen to any suggestions Please Don\\'t Tell is a speakeasy bar in the East Village where you enter through a phone booth to get in there.\\nhttp://www.pdtnyc.com/ -Kick Axe in Brooklyn\\n-Long Island Bar in Brooklyn for the vibe and burgers!\\n-Royal Palms...drink and play shuffleboard at the same time...also in Bklyn\\nDo know that as of today, NYC has a vaccine mandate. Both of you will need to show proof of at least 1 vaccine in order to sit inside bars/restaurants. Corresponding ID will almost always be asked for. Be prepared for that. If it’s too quirky, it becomes touristy.\\nI just left Bar Six. A totally local great place to drink. Leans French. Bar Pisellino is one of those places that locals and tourists enjoy.\\nHeaded to my next locale. I’m sure I’ll think of more places later. City is full of cool restaurants/cafes. don\\'t waste time worrying about tourists. If you get out of times square and a place is any good you will see locals there in addition to any tourists. Anything on the internet will have some tourists. That doesn\\'t mean the place should be avoided. Just walking around residential areas like UES, UWS, LES, Soho, Chelsea or any place where a lot of people live and you will see a variety of places to explore. I live here and it is what I do when I go outside my own neighborhood and don\\'t have set plans. Places like PDT are full of tourists and locals alike. Doesn\\'t make it a bad place but it is hardly some secret location. Anything on the internet will draw people if it is a good place. I like places like Apotheke, Auction House, The Penrose, The Bar Downstairs, which is actually located in the basement of the Andaz across from the NY Public library. Kick Axe is certainly different I mean its axe throwing for crying out loud. There will certainly be tourists there but it would still be interesting if it appeals to you. As a local I will even go to the lounge at the Mandarin Oriental which has nice views while having a drink.

Our plans for day one were largely outdoors, so we\\'re rethinking them. I\\'ve talked my husband (not an art or museum lover) into going to the Museum of Arts and Design, but that\\'s only a couple of hours max. I read somewhere that St. John the Divine on the UWS is really wonderful and we\\'ve never been there before. Any feedback on that, and any other suggestions? Note: we\\'ve been to the city many, many times, so we\\'re looking for something beyond the \"usual suspects.\" St. John the Divine is wonderful but like St Patricks on 5th Avenue youre in and out unless youre attending a mass. The Basilica of St. Patricks Old Cathedral on Mulberry Street has a candlelight catacombs tour, which is beyond the usual.\\nhttps://oldcathedral.org/ If you decide to visit St Johns the Devine and are looking for other things to do on the UWS, there\\'s always shopping! The Time Warner Center on Columbus Circle has plenty of shops and boutiques to browse, as well as dining options; and the Turnstyle Underground Market below Columbus Cirlce at the 59th Street Subway entrance would also be something different.\\nI know you said \\'no museums\\' but the Museum of Natural History has something for everyone; or maybe consider a tour of Lincoln Center?\\nAnd of course you have to eat... when we\\'re on the UWS we like Bellini\\'s Italian Restaurant on Columbus Avenue for authentic homemade pastas and sauces or a thiin crust \\'New Haven Style\\' Apizza!

Have there been any changes in recent years? We\\'ve really never been to the UWS above the 80s and the author of the Frommer\\'s Guide was very up on the Cathedral (I guess they do offer tours) and we enjoy interesting architecture. We\\'ve also never set foot in Lincoln Center which is funny, considering how many times we\\'ve walked past it, so a tour there could be nice too. 9/11 Museum, MET Museum are some things indoor that you would spend some time at.

I have always stayed there on my trips, until my last one in 2018, when I stayed at Radio City Apartments. The only reason I switched was because they charged for WIFI - through a third party - and limited that to one device.\\nI\\'ve just made a reservation at Radio City for my trip in March 2022 (and I think, got a great deal) but thought I would check out the Salisbury, to see if they\\'ve updated their WIFI policy. Radio City Apartments is fine, but I prefer the room size and location of the Salisbury.\\nHowever, they no longer seem to have a presence on the web - or a proper entry on TA.\\nIt would be a great shame if this fine old fashioned, non-chain establishment has become another casualty of the pandemic. https://yourmileagemayvary.net/2021/02/26/sad-list-all-the-hotels-in-new-york-city-that-have-closed-for-good-due-to-covid/\\nYes , I’m afraid it has closed.\\nRead this list of closed hotels in NYC, its written on Feb 26 2021. I Found it when planning and picking a hotel for my New York City trip about that time. Yes, The Salisbury Hotel has permanently closed. It was a planned closing. I think the final guests checked out just before the pandemic in January 2020. The size of their very basic suites could not be beat in midtown. According to a post from Nov. 2019 demolition permits were pulled for this building. It is apparently located in the middle of the supertall pencil towers along 57th street. I stayed there on a business trip in the late 1970\\'s that was paid for by a client who was a devout Baptist, because the hotel was owned by the Baptist church next door. The rooms were quite large (especially by New York City standards) and the experience, as I remember, was more than adequate. My guess now is that they never updated or refreshed it, because they had a devout potential customer base that supported them.\\nhttps://newyorkyimby.com/2019/11/demo-permits-filed-for-123-west-57th-street-in-midtown-manhattan.html Did the Roosevelt Hotel close as well? It shows it on the list.\\nRoosevelt Hotel 45 E. 45th St. 1,015\\nLooks like it has: https://www.theroosevelthotel.com/?utm_source=local-directories&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=travelclick-localconnect-featured\\nEdited: 12:14 am, May 11, 2021 In addition to the Salisbury, I have stayed at the Biltmore, the Abbey Victoria, and the Piccadilly hotels (all of them now long gone). Is it me, or is it just the NYC real estate game? That\\'s a shame - I guess I qualify as one of their regular (if not devout) customers, and stayed there 6 or 7 times. It was on the Virgin Holiday/Virgin Atlantic list of recommended hotels, so I think was popular with fellow UK visitors. As you say, the rooms were very large ( I think it was originally an apartment building).\\nI don\\'t think they ever really entered the 21st century - there was no bar, restaurant or room service, the furnishings were dated and the two lifts (sorry, elevators!) were painfully slow. That was all part of the charm as far as I was concerned. And the location was perfect. But as I said in my OP, I abandoned them in the end because of the lack of WIFI facilities - essential these days if you\\'re overseas, for calling or e mailing home and for airline check in etc. The Salisbury, Hotel Penn, and the Grand Hyatt are all being razed and replaced by office towers. The new building on the GH site will be 1,650” tall. The plan is to eventually raze the Roosevelt too. Much of the hotel loss was precipitated by the Midtown East Rezoning that extends roughly from 38th to 57th sts. between about 3rd Ave. and midblock Madison/5th Ave. The intention was to create modern office buildings that would retain businesses in Midtown. The Salisbury was on the north side of 57th St. that is being redeveloped with supertall apartments along its length that is now called \"Billionaires Row.\" The tenants in one of these are suing the developer as the building groans in the wind that bends the building and causing elevators to get stuck. Water pipes have also broken due to this.\\nEdited: 7:50 am, September 29, 2021 Hi, I am traveling to New York early October from Singapore and am fully vaccinated. Will I be able to use the digital certificate I have from Singapore as proof of vaccination or would I have to convert it somehow? I saw that the apps that restaurants actively look at for Excelsior app or NYC Covid Safe but I am not able to download them. Probably because they are not available to anyone outside of the US region. You could look into downloading the NYC app once you are here. All you do is upload a photo of your paper certificate to it. They don\\'t check anything, as the NY State app does. You also need photo ID, like a passport. Your vax proof should have name, DOB, vax name, lot number, date(s) of administration. Don\\'t rely on anything with a QR code to be scanned, as it is not likely to work here.\\nEdited: 12:25 am, September 29, 2021 When I went to New York in August from Montreal we had yet to get an app in Canada, however, I had a copy of my vaccination proof on my phone with all the information mentioned by Grandrue, I had no issue entering with that proof. I’ve been looking at theatre tickets and it mentions proof of vaccinations being required. We are from the UK and our proof is on our NHS app or a vaccine card.\\nWill these be accepted or do we need to get something else? Likely your vaccine card and passport will work. Should be + matching ID\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page\\nNeeded for a variety of indoor activities\\nMasks in some places too (transit etc) I’ve got the NHS covid app, taking my vaccine card and also the letter\\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/covid-pass/get-your-covid-pass-letter/ I expect (at least I hope) that as the time draws near, ticket takers, restaurant hostesses, etc. will get some training in what official cards, etc look like from different countries. However, in the case of international travelers, unlike domestic ones, there\\'s some reassurance that before people got here their paperwork was checked by airline people in their home countries and they wouldn\\'t have been allowed on the plane if their papers were not in order. In the US there are no standards for domestic flyers and they can pretty much do what they want, including forging vaccine cards.\\nI suggest also having your passport with you as photo ID. Our covid vaccine cards in the UK are just bits of card with the serial numbers of the vaccine and our name on it\\nThe NHS covid app has our name, date of birth and the serial numbers of where they were administered (along with a QR code) and the letter has the above and our address on them -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 7:36 pm, September 26, 2021\\nEdited: 7:36 pm, September 26, 2021 If the UK only gives FDA and/or WHO approved vaccines then I doubt there will be an issue as long as you have a photo id like a passport that matches up with the vaccination document. I wouldn\\'t count in most places to be scanning QR codes and some places outside tourist hubs might turn you away if they are unfamiliar with the documents. The main tourist area businesses will likely become quickly familiar with the documentation from the UK. That is pretty much what our cards look like -- name, DOB, name and lot no. of vaccine, place of administration. They will most likely be looking for misspellings and things that don\\'t match up , as that is how they catch American forgeries -- like Aster Zeneca instead of Astra Zeneca and spelling of your name or DOB doesn\\'t match what is on your passport. I agree it is unlikely they will be able to scan anything digital. Suggest also bringing photocopies of your paper card.\\nEdited: 6:58 pm, September 26, 2021 Usually a picture of the vaccination card (front and back) works. Ideally you can bring your real card! There is text along with the QR code. I would post a pic with my details removed but this app doesn’t support it.\\nThe UK administers Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford AstraZenica We are staying at the TWA hotel because of an early flight (plus its cool). But after checking in, thought it would be fun to go the the night market in Queens.\\nGoogle Maps blew up and couldn’t find a route by public transportation to the night market. Is there a way to catch the Q10 from JFK and transfer to the 7 train or the Q28/48? Or just Uber or go somewhere else? I dont live far from Flushing Meadow Park, When I want to go to JFK, I just Uber it. Id say the Uber is about $30\\nIts about a 20-30 Min ride depending on the traffic.\\nI actually think this is a good choice if you dont mind paying the taxi fare\\nIf you want to take Public transport you need to take the JFK Airtrain to Jamaica and transfer to the Q44 bus to Flushing, In FLushing you transfer to the 7 train With 2, Uber would make sense as the Airtrain already means $15. It’s not often Google Maps gets stumped - they have provided complicated public transportation directions before…\\nWill also need to decide if the night market is interesting enough. The ones in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur was interesting. The one in Vancouver was just corn dogs. And more corn dogs. With spiral fries.. Ive never gone to the queens night market even though I live near it. Its not about corn dogs Its supposed to be about the different foods in Queens Is Queens night market worth the trek from Chelsea neighborhood? Is it mainly food or also other goods for sale? Queens Night Market is not every night\\nhttp://queensnightmarket.com/\\nIts mostly about food from Queens, Various vendors will be selling their food specialities I was attracted to the 90 food vendors from all over the world. With dishes called at $5-&6. Seems like there is a big variety of countries represented plus free admission..: https://astoriapost.com/queens-night-market-will-be-free-starting-this-weekend There will be a large varierty of food, This is not aimed at well healed New Yorkers or tourists, its aimed at locals I would agree that getting to the market is difficult by public transportation from JFK. People in Flushing generally take some form of car service to the airport. There is a taxi stand for the green taxis at Main and Roosevelt in Flushing on the NW corner, but cars are not always there. Getting back might prove more difficult than going to the market. The Q44 bus from Jamaica to Flushing can take as much as an hour and this is a pay before you enter line with limited stops. **Is Queens night market worth the trek from Chelsea neighborhood?**\\nWould a local make that trek? Probably not.\\nWould/should a tourist? Sure...if you want to check it out.\\nI have make similar treks to check out night markets in various world cities and had a ball. You have limited time during your trip and it seems that you are looking to try to do too much...in my opinion.\\nIf you want to see what it looks like...check out a Youtube vid. Here is one but note this was PRE-COVID:\\nhttps://youtu.be/hSPbAZk3zEY\\n^\\nNot my vid. I agree that car transport from/to JFK would be the way to go for this destination .

Room size is not important but prefer double beds and budget is under 300 USD/night before tax. Dates are Oct 7 - 11 and Must be Marriott or Hilton brand.\\nThank you in advance! Did you know the Residence Inn Central Park is in that same building as the Courtyard but on the higher floors? There are even better views from that RI because it\\'s on higher floors, but nightly rates are probably higher as well. Both hotels share the same lobby but the RI has it\\'s own breakfast room and breakfast, that was the case a few years ago anyway.\\nThe AC Hotel Times Square is a Marriott property. Some rooms might have city views but I don\\'t know what their rates are like. They have a rooftop terrace.\\nhttps://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nycma-ac-hotel-new-york-times-square/rooms/\\nThe Moxy Hotels are also Marriott properties. Moxy\\'s are in Times Square, Chelsea and the East Village.\\nAnother one with beautiful views if you\\'re happy to stay downtown is the Courtyard Downtown/World Trade Center. The WTC View rooms are really pretty at night with the Memorial lights, and the 6th (?) floor outdoor terrace overlooks the Memorial. Other rooms face the Hudson River or further downtown.\\nFor Hilton, the Hilton Fashion District seems to have rooms with views and also a nice looking rooftop bar. I haven\\'t looked at their rates though.\\nhttps://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/nycfdhf-hilton-new-york-fashion-district/rooms/\\nOne thing to note, when you book hotel rooms and want a view, no matter where you stay, you could put on your room request that you\\'d like a high floor room. These can sometimes get good results for views. On my last trip almost two years ago I stayed at the Millennium Hilton Downtown. Had amazing views from my 25th floor room looking down on the Oculus and 9/11 Memorial. There was even a break between buildings looking towards the Hudson and watched some big ships go by. What about COURTYARD NEW YORK MANHATTAN/MIDTOWN WEST - newer and their Skyline Double Queen looks really nice - although not sure what the views are of and also wondering about location. That\\'s on 10th avenue. Not far from Hudson Yards and the river, but it\\'s not really near attractions All the rooms at the Hilton Millenium UN Plaza , at 1st & 44th, should have views because they don\\'t start until about the 30th floor. However, while some have floor to ceiling windows, I don\\'t believe all do. Views will vary from river (east) to city and river (south) to midtown and maybe Chrysler Bldg and other landmarks (west), to city and river (north). I think this hotel, which has been open throughout the pandemic, still has some restrictions, like no valet parking, no room service, some other restaurant limits, and vax proof required for access to gym. It should be within your budget.\\nEdited: 10:03 pm, September 28, 2021 https://www.centralparknyc.org/activities/events/the-5-browns-presented-by-steinway-sons\\nA concert with five Steinway grand pianos and eight piano pieces—from Beethoven to Gershwin to Bernstein—performed by Steinway Artists Deondra, Desirae, Gregory, Melody, and Ryan Brown.

Starting Nov. 1, Governors Island will be open from 7 a.m. to 6:15 p.m., seven days a week, all year long.\\nAdditionally, to accommodate the new schedule, the mayor also announced that ferry service to Governors Island will also expand. According to de Blasio, once the city\\'s new Coney Island Line ferry launches, it will stop at Governors Island year round.\\nhttps://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/governors-island-to-open-year-round-with-expanded-ferry-service/3295557/ He’s so wedded to these ferries. Will be interesting to see what the next admin does w them. The ferries are very nice, but mostly useless. I did go to Governors Island 2 weeks ago and it was great, it was a perfect day to go I think the ferry system will have change at some point\\nBut since BdB spent so much money on boats & docks don\\'t think it will go away anytime soon\\nOr maybe, Hornblower, the operator will eventually absorb it into their tourist operations ? Most likley they will just raise the price, most of the people who use it are either tourists or well heeled people, they can afford a price increase I think extending the season a bit would be more than enough. I can\\'t see many people going there in December, January, or February. It can be in the 40\\'s and 50\\'s in December , January and February. Its not that bad to go out\\nI went to Brooklyn Bridge Park on a beautiful day in Janaury and it was in the 60\\'s . I would go if it was that warm on a weekend on a nice day.\\nIve been to most parks even the beach in the winter (No I didnt do a Polar bear swim at Coney Island, but I have been there in January) I like the idea of extending the opening season but unless they have something going on to attract the people over winter, it might not get the people they\\'re hoping for. I lke the ferry idea too, they\\'re great imo.\\nIt will be interesting to see what pans out with the The Center for Climate Solutions there. Ferries in the winter aren\\'t so great in my opinion.\\nClimate solutions, meh, just another political agenda, that\\'s all.\\nEdited: 6:18 pm, September 28, 2021 Are there any events planned for this Sunday, October 3, 2021, the 70th anniversary of \"the shot heard around the world\" at the old site of the Polo Grounds? Not that I know of\\nA side note, the stairs down to the Polo Grounds (John T Brush Staircase) is still there\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/COGzARgLP5x/ Thanks, I will be in town this weekend. I would like to also see where home plate was located. Is it safe to visit that area? Its kind of on a side of a cliff (Coogans Bluff), the stairs isnt an issue, Sylvan La, The Morris Jumeal Mansion and the Highbridge are in the area.\\nI did not walk down to the projects where homeplate is. I think during the day you should be fine There\\'s an apartment complex built on most of the site - if you appreciate basketball https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rucker_Park is at the bottom of the hill No the Polo Ground projects are not safe to walk around. I really cannot imagine any Giant fans holding any sort event for them winning the pennant (especially since they lost the World Series to the Yankees four games to two. I just remember my mother crying when she was listening to the game. I haven\\'t been there since the pandemic but had no problems\\nI went there with a couple of German visitors who wanted to see Rucker Park\\nA gentleman coming up the stairs helpfully confirmed the directions as it wasn\\'t entirely obvious from the top of the hill (I have a wonky knee so I wasn\\'t going to walk that hill without being sure)\\nIf in the area Sylvan Terrace, adjacent to to the Morris Jumel mansion, is worth a look along with the views from the top of the bluff from the mansion grounds https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sylvan-terrace Which hotel would be best? Tia What are your requirements, that may help people give more advice\\nEdited: 5:35 pm, September 27, 2021 Just close to Times Square, clean, good breakfast\\nFor the dates I’m going the riu New York is €500 dearer than the riu manhattan (4 nights) They\\'re both very close to TS, on either side. Both will be 5 minute walk to TS but will have a TS vibe at the hotel because the billboards and lights are spread in nearby streets.\\nThe one on 47th St (Riu Manhattan) is very new so there aren\\'t many reviews to compare with. The other one is already established and has pretty good reviews.\\nIf you\\'ve got cancellable bookings and aren\\'t travelling for a couple of months you might want to just wait and see what the reviews for the Manhattan are over the next few months then make a decision then. My husband and I along with our children ages 12 and 9 would love to see New York at Christmas time. We are planning to book for next December but I’m am not sure how practical and kid friendly New York at that time of year is? I understand it will be very busy so don’t know if it will be as enjoyable for the kids as we hope it would be.\\nWe would want to see Central Park, the lights and displays and also natural history museum etc\\nWe were looking at booking for 5 nights.\\nI don’t really fancy going to New York at any other time of the year but don’t know if I should wait until my youngest is a bit older.\\nAny advice would be most welcome! Those ages are fine and it is kid friendly. But, if you have the option to not travel between Christmas and New Year, you will be a lot better off. The crowds at museums and popular tourist spots will be crazy that week. Do you mean Dec 2022?\\nIn any case, NYC is always kid-friendly. I mean there are places you do not take kids such as night clubs and such, but places like Central Park and AMNH are fine.\\nKeep in mind that hotel prices vary by date. First part of the month is high because people like to shop in NYC and get home to prep for holidays days leading up to Christmas are generally lower; then rise again as New Year’s Eve approaches.\\nRight now there are mask and COVID vaccination requirements in place. Scroll the forum to read about that if you are interested. Who know what things will be like 14-15 months from now.\\nEdited: 11:11 am, September 27, 2021 I think NYC has tons to do for kids. The AMNH, Central Park, the zoo, Scholastic Book Store, etc. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13419686-Christmastime_in_NYC_2020_What_s_On_Dates_Updates-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHere is the most current thread on things to do in NYC at Christmas. There should be one posted for 2021 in a month or two. If everything is opened up there is a ton of stuff for kids to see in NYC during Christmas time. Probably one of the more interesting times of year for them with all the lights and decorations etc. December 2021 probably won\\'t be ideal but hopefully things will be as close to normal as possible by December 2022. Plenty to do in NYC. Also go to Serendipity 3 for ice cream for the kids. I use to live in Miami, so I am spoiled. However I imagine there is a great one in NYC. Any suggestions? First you want great mole in NYC, now it’s cubanos? Seriously you are in Florida. The worst you find there will be better than almost anything you have in NYC. I know. I’m originally from the sunshine state. That said Margon makes a decent one. Next thing you will asking where to get local key lime pie. 😂 Traditional - Margon\\nNot traditional - Casellula (\"Pig\\'s a$$ sandwich\")\\nKey Lime - Steve\\'s Authentic Key Lime Pie\\nStone Crabs - The Lobster Place If you find yourself in Brooklyn - “My Cuban Spot” at Carroll St & Third Av. Delicious & fun. The owner is great, somehow managing to turn out food from what’s basically a closet. No dine-in (too small), you eat outside on stools & pretend you’re in Miami instead of Gowanus. Actually i was thinking about asking for a recommendation for orange juice! Steve’s Authentic Key Lime Pie sounds delicious!!! Hello,\\nI am planning a trip to NYC and travel to some other cities for about a week, then will be back to NYC for a couple of nights before going back to our country. We would like to leave our big suitcase in NYC while we go to other cities.\\nI saw some suggestions in this forum for keeping luggage at Schwartz Luggage Storage. However when I google it, it said PERMANENTLY CLOSED.\\nCould someone please advise any other reliable luggage storage facilities around Times Square area, or maybe if someone know that Schwartz Luggage Storage is really permanently closed or still in service?\\nThank you. You can,Ike ly leave it at your initial hotel for a small fee and/or a good tip Hello, thank you for gour reply.\\nHowever I\\'ve emailed around 12 to 15 hotel (Luma, Henn na, Hilton Garden Inn, Embassy Suites by Hilton, Holiday Inn, Hyatt Place and some others, they only keep our luggage for check in and check out day. They\\'re very specific that no overnight luggage keeping, not even for some fees.\\nThat\\'s why we need to find luggage storage facility :) Google is not infallible\\nIt appears Schwartz has reopened http://schwartztravel.com/ I can\\'t count how many hotels I have left luggage at for more than 1 day when I wasn\\'t staying there that had policies against it.\\n$20 and a nice word to a friendly bellman go a long way\\nEdited: 8:25 am, September 24, 2021 Thank you, Kaye_in_Astoria. I\\'ll recheck with Schwartz again :) Thank you, Northern_Traveler00.\\nYes it has never been a problem before for me to leave some luggage in a hotel while traveling to other cities especially when I\\'ll come back to stay at the same hotel. I\\'ve done this so many times during my travel around the world, and I\\'ve been to 23 countries and 97 cities (in Asia, Australia, Europe and also USA).\\nSo it was a surprise for me as well when I get this kind of reply from NYC hotels (this is going to be my first trip to NYC). I even get the storage center name like Schwartz and Stasher from some of the hotels when they reply to my queries.\\nHowever thank you very much for replying me. Have a nice day :) I am almost 100% sure that Schwartz is still closed. I passed it last week.\\n(They just never update their website.) ter1413, thank you for your reply. If memory serves, I don\\'t think I\\'ve never been asked how long I was going to leave my luggage when dropping it off with the attendant...and I\\'ve certainly left it for a fair few days. A tip on pick-up and no questions asked. More and more hotels are probably just being cautions and ramping up security....so I can see why some would not want to store luggage that doesn\\'t belong to a guest. Hi,\\nMy family is heading to Providence for a graduation in late May, but we want to spend time in NYC and Boston. Thinking of doing 2 days in Boston then taking train to NYC and staying 4 days. Any recommendations on which neighborhood to stay in for both cities so we can get the most out of this trip? Please share hotel and restaurant recommendations, and any must see spots as well. Thank you! We\\'ll need to know lots more about you in order to give you anything beyond the most generic recommendations.\\nTell us:\\nYour interests for spots to see\\nYour tastes for restaurants\\nYour budget for hotels\\nHow many of you are there\\nDates of your visit (prices vary wildly by date)\\nThe more details you give us the more detailed advice we can give you For New York:\\nHotel Riu Plaza is showing ok prices for mid to late May and has breakfast.\\nThe Evelyn could be another choice. It is a little farther downtown but makes Mid town and the all the downtown neighborhoods walkable.\\nFor Boston:\\nwe like to stay in Cambridge at the Kimpton just across a walking bridge to Central Boston, but that is because it offers parking (for a fee) and it has a T stop right there, so even the farther places are easily accessible.\\nHappy planning, stay safe, & have fun! Expect higher prices in Boston for May due to the numerous collège and university graduations. It’s one of the hotel high seasons of the year. Sounds like no car, so no need for parking or staying in Cambridge. Cambridge rarely makes the most sense for folks with limited time in Boston unless seeing Harvard and MIT dominate the plans You might want to post this query in the Road Trips forum as they are the experts in multi city trips. I have tried to answer this but my post keeps failing.\\nBefore solidifying dates check Boston Hotel prices. There is one 4-5 day stretch each May when over 20 Boston area colleges hold commencement exercises. This fills hotels and drives up prices. Depending on dates, it may be more cost effective to visit NYC before Boston.\\nAmtrak runs between all three cities. There is also MBTA commuter rail between Boston and Providence.\\nHappy Planning!\\nEdited: 12:32 pm, September 27, 2021 I probably shouldn’t let this out, but Kimpton Marlowe in Cambridge is a hidden gem right across the bridge and closer to the West End, Boston Market, and Faneuil Hall than many Of the farther out Boston Hotels. Also the Lecmere Square T stop is there if you want to go further. I agree with others & would try to avoid graduation. I went to their location at the Dekalb market hall and had an arepa with cheese. I didn\\'t even know arepas could be this good. I\\'ve had them in Colombia and they were meh but these were amazing. Strongly recommend if you are visiting the downtown Brooklyn area or exploring Jackson Heights Queens. My best one was from a street vendor in Cartagena. I will have to try these! Another great arepera is Guacuco, with locations in Bushwick (near the Bushwick Collective) and Bed-Stuy. Fantastic arepas with a variety of fillings, plus other home style Venezuelan dishes and refreshing drinks (especially the passion fruit). Sounds delicious. I don\\'t think I have ever tried an arepa. They sound tasty. They are. My wife makes them all the time. You can get arepa flour in the latin section of most supermarkets. Don Arepa or PAN both good brands. A few months ago on a day trip to Baltimore, I had some great seafood arepas at a place near the AMTRAK station. Prior to that, the only arepas I ever had were the corn mozzarella ones at street fairs.\\nA few weeks ago I saw an Arepa bar near Herald Square but I wasn\\'t hungry. Yesterday during my walkabout between The Strand and Grand Central I went in search of it. I would it and had 2 great short rib arepas.\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/susan.katz.92/posts/10159425504212236?notif_id=1632435778861297¬if_t=feedback_reaction_generic&ref=notif\\nhttps://www.costasnyc.com/?fbclid=IwAR2bInXX_SG9Fumj-PJbiFOwMxVfiIszGRB4nbQjqcGaFjGJGEOpVSK89WE Might have to try that one! We had the best arepas in San Juan. They are so good! Just got tickets. Scoured the internet looking to see who the guest might be, no luck. Anyone have an idea where to look?\\nAlso any game shows taped in NYC?\\nEdited: 2:11 pm, September 22, 2021 When are you visiting NYC? I am thinking about getting tickets as well, but they don\\'t have dates available that far in advance. Guests are usually announced a few days before taping. I don’t know where you’d find information about upcoming guests, other than the official website. Be aware you have to provide proof of vaccination to attend. I got to see Letterman some years back, great experience. If I recall they published the week’s guests on Monday morning. I got to see Tom Brokaw, a local band, and they had a special presentation of that year’s Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue including a Top Ten segment with the women. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 1:57 pm, September 23, 2021 Check here: https://colbert.1iota.com/show/536/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert\\nJimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon as well as Seth Meyers mention at time beforehand who will be on the show. Please report back about your experience at the Late Show! I got tickets for october and would like to know what the experience is like. I’m sorry if this has been discussed but I wasn’t able to find any recent discussion.\\nI’ve been invited to a private event in a hotel. I am double vaccinated but my plus 1 is wondering if she can offer up a recent negative test result. Is this common practice? Will she be turned away? If she won’t be vaccinated and won’t gain entry, I’ll tell her now and invite somebody else. I’m going to call the hotel’s concierge tomorrow to see what they say but wanted to run it by you anyway.\\nThanks!\\nKaki I have not heard of that, except for children under 12, who cannot be vaccinated (and in that case it has to be done I think within 72 hours before they enter). **but my plus 1 is wondering if she can offer up a recent negative test result. Is this common practice?**\\nNo it isn\\'t.\\nThe mandate is clear. if the hotel\\'s event space is abiding by the rules, she won\\'t be permitted inside. Thanks very much!\\nIn follow up, the venue said that if they open the doors and it’s a partially open space, she could attend. Not knowing what the weather will be that night, I’m not taking any chances and have told her that she likely wouldn’t be let in.\\nKaki Assuming your Plus 1 would be coming with you from Canada, she also needs to understand what she would have to do upon returning to Canada as an unvaccinated citizen. Better safe than sorry. Thanks MeeMee, she’s actually a Manhattan resident. I certainly wouldn’t undertake a trip like this that means so much to me with somebody who was unvaccinated and might hold me up. I want zero margin for catastrophe!\\nKaki Hi,\\nMy family of four will be coming from out of state to see a Broadway show next month. 2 adults and 12 year old are vaxxed, 10 year old is not. For those who have been to a show since reopening, any help on these questions would be much appreciated!\\n1) How long does the extra vax and ID check add to getting into the shows? Is it slowing down the admittance lines quite a bit that we should get there fairly early? I guess it may vary by theatre and how quickly each does the vax card and ID check, but anybody with experience, I would be interested to hear how the process was.\\n2) For our 10yr old, he will either need a PCR test no more than 72 hours ahead or a rapid anti-gen test no more than 6 hours ahead. The website says an over-the-counter test is allowed for the rapid anti-gen, though must show date/time of the test. Are there any Over the Counter tests that are capable of showing date/time? If anybody has used one, please let me know what brand or where to find such a test. Our fall back will be finding a lab test, but i think it would be so much easier to just do it in our hotel room.\\n3) It appears we can just take a photo on our phones of our vax cards for the 3 of us and just pull up the picture to show to enter the show (and other indoor venues). If anybody has had issues not being allowed to just pull up a picture of the vax card, let me know.\\nThanks so much! I saw American Utopia Friday night. I had drinks w a different friend before hand in the Village and jumped in a cab (it was practically waiting for me so I grabbed it) at about 7:40. So I was pretty close to curtain when I arrived. The line moved very quickly to show your vax card/app although they asked me to click on the app to show the QR code (they didn’t scan it, just wanted to see it).\\nWe were asked to wear masks of course. I don’t know how it works with kids.\\nWe had the most amazing seats and that show is fantastic. I forgot how much fun dancing is! It’s been a long year and a half. Brief hijack, I think I want to see American Utopia again on this upcoming trip. Scott, the person I was with saw it twice before. I saw Hamilton on Tuesday (first time! It was every bit as good as everyone says!)\\nA few weeks before our show, I got an email telling us what time to arrive. Since we had the \"cheap\" seats, we were asked to arrive 45 minutes in advance. Other sections were told to arrive 35, 25, and 15 minutes in advance. I\\'m not sure there was any penalty for arriving at the wrong time, but we did.\\nThat same email also recommended downloading the \"NYC safe\" app, which is basically just a way to store photos of your ID and vax card in a way that is easy to pull up.\\nThe theatre had a special employee with a shirt that said something like \"covid compliance checker,\" who checked us while we were waiting in line, before entering the theatre.\\nEdited: 2:31 am, September 27, 2021 The app is actually called \"NYC Covid Safe\" The NY State app is useless for out-of-state residents. My phone photo of my CDC card was accepted (with an accompanying official photo ID) at the Samuel Friedman last week. NYC covid safe app is not the same thing as NY state app and can be used by anyone. NYC covid safe app is just storing images of the CDC card. Unlike the state app it does not verify anything. I couldn\\'t find the NYC Covid Safe app in my app store. I have photos of my card and the certificate subsequently emailed to me by the Ministry of Health. Our Ministry has also come up with a more official certificate with a code on it that can be checked if desired, but I haven\\'t received mine yet. I imagine what I\\'ve got already is adequate, but I\\'ll push to get the new official one in time if I can. It\\'s going to be needed to enter the USA anyway, possibly prior to our trip in November. The NYC COVID Safe App isn’t available in the App Store outside the US. Well that would explain it! Just a reminder AIRBNBs in NYC are not to be trusted. It amazes me how people will stay in places like this just to save a buck. God knows what could have happened to them.\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/09/25/illegally-documented-vans-placed-on-airbnb-seized-in-nyc/ Those vans sound like they should be “down by the river” I am amazed that this fine reputable company allows listing that don’t give renters 24 hour access to a toilet. I am totally dumbfounded that a supposedly intelligent person like the \"journalist/video creator\" in the NY Post article would go for such an offer Wow!! I like a good deal, but that is ridiculous. Novel concept for sure, but without running water and a bathroom, not really a good choice.\\nThey should have left the vans and allowed the drug addicts to use them, as opposed to doing drugs in broad daylight:\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/09/25/nyc-drug-users-shoot-up-in-broad-daylight-in-midtown/ They missed some creative angles with this. If they had been more themed like the Mystery Machine from Scooby Doo, the A-Team van, Partridge Family, etc, maybe no one would notice the bad plates or the bathroom issue. I guess copywrite problems would creep up though... The whole “Van life” obsession baffles me. If you’ve ever slept in your car at night, it’s pretty scary. I get wanting a care free type of lifestyle, but it just doesn’t sound safe to me considering how many cars are broken in to daily in cities. By the way... if you ever consider renting an RV with Outdoorsy... RECONSIDER. I booked an RV with them that caught on fire and left me and my girlfriend stuck on the side of the highway for 5 hours. Worst of all, Outdoorsy did virtually nothing to help us out. Just a warning! I heard on the radio this morning that the city sheriff impounded a number of these vans. Over Columbus Day weekend our family is going to NYC. We just found out that one of our favorite bands is playing at the Rooftop at Pier 17. Ideally, my husband and I want to go to the concert (from 6-10) and my daughters 19 & 18 want to \"hang out\". My question is...how safe is that area after dark? It looks like it is near the One World Trade Center. Would they be safe walking around the area going to bookstores, coffee shops and stores? Thanks so much . BTW- we have been to NYC several times in the past, but not in this area. Yes. It’s safe. As safe as any other area I’d Manhattan, if not more so as there is usually a fairly heavy police oversight presence. Yeah, it\\'s safe. :)\\nHowever, I think it\\'d be nice for them to spend some time in the Village. Hanging out in Washington Square Park is nice, as well as walking around in the area. It\\'s near the campus of NYC too so a lot of young people often in the area as well\\nEdited: 2:01 pm, September 25, 2021 Maxi, the Seaport has become more and more alive too. Pretty crazy down here (in a good way). These kids can’t drink but Big Gay Ice Cream and Van Leeuwen are both on Front street and VL is open until midnight. So they can go after the concert.\\nBut yes. They should explore other areas while they’re here including WSP. Totally safe, but one should always be aware of their surroundings. Yup, the seaport area has become quite lively., Risa. I like it. That sounds really fun. I had not heard of “the seaport area” before. Can you list other fun things to do, eat, see in that area after 6pm? Maybe even a little bit outside that area but not more than 20min walking and no subways. That area - the South Street Seaport - was historically a center of commerce and shipping. The Fulton Fish Market used to be there. It was converted to Bars abs restaurants maybe 20 years ago and then fell out of favor. In the last few years, it has been rebuilt with lots of new stores and many new, and relaunched old, restaurants. Pier 17 - right across South Street beneath the FDR Drive, has been converted to another sight for restaurants, concerts, and entertainment. And immediately south, old ships have been moored there for public visitation. https://theseaport.nyc/\\nhttps://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/\\nPersonally, Bellini is my favorite restaurant in the Seaport, and The Fulton at Pier 17. but there are just so many. Your kids may like Cowgirl Seahorse or Industry Kitchen. Or tacos at Luchadores\\nThere is more to see in the whole downtown area, but I’ve just posted the links to the immediate area. Ananda walking around the seaport itself is a thing to do. It\\'s where there are sailing ships, a museum with history, and plenty of places to eat, drink, and hang out. You\\'re also at a spot where you can catch the NYC fast ferries to a number of different places. Yes, it\\'s very safe. I don\\'t consider Pier 17 to be that close to One World Trade Center, although it\\'s a distance that New Yorkers would walk without feeling it was very far. Suburbanites, maybe not.\\nIt\\'s important to understand that, while the South Street Seaport is an Entertainment DIstrict of its own, the area around it is fading fast as a \"charming relic of old New York.\" There aren\\'t that many bookstores or even bars, and the original businesses are being \"gentrified\", or replaced with law offices, high-end ice cream, or still vacant and under renovation. It also suffers from Covid-era vacancies.\\nI am not making a comment about SAFETY. I\\'m suggesting that South Street Seaport is a glorified, attractive .... Mall, originally developed by the Rouse Corporation in response to a similar success in Boston. You are not going to meet George Washington\\'s ghost, or have much to do besides the mall food shops and mall merchandising.\\nI was there last month. Thanks obsoperator, I was also thinking along the same lines, but just to be sure I checked the Bridge Cafe (an historic and real restaurant) to find that it\\'s been permanently closed since 2020 when it sustained storm damage. That was a \"real\" place with history, a presence, and I knew people who worked there during the Koch administration! (How am I doing?) We will be in New York City (from the UK) on Christmas Day 2021. We are looking for recommendations for a decent steakhouse in Midtown Manhattan, for lunch or dinner that day. We are not familiar with local customs regarding what is usually open on Christmas Day, so recommendations and suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you! Its a bit early for Christmas reservations & there may be restaurants that are not open due to Covid. Try again in the beginning of November. Unlike London, many places stay open for Xmas day from restaurants and the transit system to some tourist venues. While it,s 3 years old, here,s the info from 2019 just to give you a sense of options.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12943009-Christmas_Day_2019_in_NYC_What_to_Do_Where_to_Eat-New_York_City_New_York.html Thank you. That is really helpful. We will also be visiting NY (from the U.K.) for a week arriving Christmas Day - so any advice around what to do / where to eat, much appreciated 🙂 I answered your question on your other thread. It is helpful to us if you don\\'t ask questions on threads that you didn\\'t start. If you do it can get confusing. Open Table is a good resource, but it only list restaurants that use this website for reservations; just put in location, date, and time.\\nhttps://www.opentable.com.au/s?dateTime=2021-09-26T19%3A00%3A00&covers=2&latitude=40.751637&longitude=-73.986409 Check out Nusr-ET Steakhouse. The viral salt bae started it and it\\'s $$$$ but I\\'ve heard it\\'s really good actually. What is the quirkiest or most unique store you’ve seen in NYC? I’d like to check out some shops that can succeed in NYC but may be too specific in other cities or towns. The most eccentric shop I’ve seen is a store that sells only dog collars. Yep, just dog collars. I’d think a typewriter store would still be going strong in NYC as a lot of writers still like old school typewriters (not the majority though). With commercial rents sky high and the pandemic, very few stores are able to thrive anymore in NYC Astute travels might notice there are very few supermarkets in Manhattan , but a chain drug store on almost every corner. Thats is a result of the rents being too high, The margins for supermarket are not high enough to support the rents. The only supermarkets that can survive are the more higher end ones that sell premium food at premium prices.\\nWe used to have a joke in my local neighborhood facebook group, whenever a new store was opening, it was either a Bank or a Sushi place, so the joke was it was a bank that sold sushi Here is a list of quirky stores in New York City:\\nhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/lists/cool-shops-in-new-york The pencil store https://cwpencils.com/ (but apparently they will be closing their retail store and will be e-commerce) Thank you, @jcmtl and Kaye ! :) I’d totally visit a pencil store. Remember in the 1980’s when it was a big deal to have pencils with unique designs on them. Having a nice pencil case was also a big deal. \"Astute travels might notice there are very few supermarkets in Manhattan \" I don\\'t know where this information comes from. There are several supermarkets in walking distance from my apartment alone. Maybe less supermarkets in primarily tourist areas, but certainly not in residential neighborhoods In my neighborhood there used to be an odd place that sold only music boxes and the wind up mechanisms\\nIt wasn\\'t a storefront but in an office space over some retail stores that did sell directly to the public but apparently most of the business was mail order. The owner was an eccentric enthusiast.\\nI think many specialized/niche businesses are similar in their mixed income streams\\nSince, as Howard mentioned, rents are very high, when a lease is up transitioning to a new cheaper location or e-commerce makes business sense\\nI\\'m guessing things might be similar in SF & other cities\\nIt\\'s sort of sad but probably inevitable Many supermarkets in Manhattan are below street level. Basement space is cheaper than street level space and since supermarkets are necessities and you don’t need to lure people in with a splashy ground floor retail store, you just need the store entrance and signage at street level.\\nThere used to be a button store, that’s all they sold, buttons. Sadly that closed.\\nThere’s some kind of odd store I pass all of the time and never walk into - on Broadway, somewhere between TriBeCa and Soho. I am making a mental note to look exactly what it’s called the next time I walk by.\\nMost of the “leather shops” closed.\\nMaybe you would find the Prada store in Soho interesting, corner of Broadway and Prince. It’s intended as a flagship/loss leader, with unusual architectural features taking up most of the space rather than a huge selling floor. Nearby is the Museum of Ice Cream, which is amusing to me. Do you know about AskNYC on Reddit? Also, maybe Fish’s Eddy, ABC Carpets, and the restaurant supply stores and lighting stores on Bowery would be interesting.\\nAt this point, I think you need to come to NYC for at least a month to do all that you are asking about! I\\'ve planned a trip for this coming December to NYC. I have never seen the Dyker Heights Christmas Lights. I\\'ll be with my husband this time, who can\\'t walk fast or far. So I thought a bus tour might be good. There seem to be a lot of options. I want one with a personable guide! I saw one that is 4 hours but starts at 4 PM. I would assume the lights are better seen in the dark...that time frame seems early to me...no? Anyone suggest the best bus tours of the lights (starting in Manhattan?)\\nWOuld love any other suggestions too. He\\'s never been to NY before...but again, can\\'t walk very much. Thank you! While there are bus tours, to actually see the lights you do get out of the bus once in the area and do some walking. The original Dyker Heights bus tour is from\\nAsliceofbrooklyn.com\\nI believe they have multiple departure times starting at 5. Sunset in Dec. is 4:30. The best light displays are on weekends. Here\\'s a good description and guide done by the company Free Tours By Foot. They also have other Xmas information.\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/dyker-heights-christmas-lights/\\nFrangipani, one of the NYC forum destination experts does a Xmas post every year for dates on displays.

It\\'s really quite wonderful. Instead of doing FB surveys like how many cities you\\'ve been to or how many things you\\'ve done, this is a visit to tidbits of world civilization. How many are part of your memories? How many are things you never knew? How many treasures do you want to know more about.\\nWhen you leave go across the street to the https://www.nypl.org/locations/snfl and have some coffee on the 7th floor. Thank you for posting! We got tickets and are looking forward to seeing the exhibit. Looking to visit NY in or around December/Christmas and wanted some suggestions on were to stay in Manhatten, Not been to NY in at least 20 years so I imagine the place has changed a lot although I have been to other parts of the US instead & I travel quite a lot. We would like to be in the thick of things were there are things on our door step 24/7, we go shopping a lot and eat out quite a bit & go to nice bars, not really bothered about visiting museums and hanging out in Time Square. Hope somebody could advise thanks in advance. A few areas to look into:\\nUnion Square\\nFlatiron\\nSoho\\nEast Village\\nGreenwich Village (only a few limited hotels though)\\nTribeca I think I would recommend Chelsea. FYI it\\'s Manhattan (no \"e\"). Union Square for starters. First, unless you are going to concentrate on sightseeing in one area of the city, there is no one good place to stay with the caveat that you stay near a subway station, preferably one that serves multiple lines.\\nIn order to give you good lodging recommendations we need exact dates of travel as hotel rates vary daily, budget in US$ including 15% taxes & desired bedding configuration. East Village would be perfect for you. It’s really lively in the evening and cheaper than Union Square. West Village would also be excellent, but probably more expensive.\\nParts of close-in Brooklyn (Parts of Williamsburg, etc) might be great too and are only a short subway ride from Manhattan on the L subway line (aka ‘the hipster express’) We have been Greenwich Village denizens for 50+ years. Here, we like the Washington Square Hotel just across the street from Washington Square Park in the heart of The Village and stay there when family comes to visit NYC and we give them our Village apartment. The area is vibrant with universities and attractions, close to SoHo and Chinatown for shopping, has great outdoor dining and has easily accessible public transportation. Many touristy attractions are within a 1-2 mile stroll from the Hotel.\\nNote: The Washington Square Hotel does not always list all of it\\'s room availabilities on the Internet. We have found that directly contacting the Hotel yields best results. For more information, see:\\nhttps://washingtonsquarehotel.com/\\nCH >We would like to be in the thick of things were there are things on our door step 24/7, we go shopping a lot and eat out quite a bit & go to nice bars, not really bothered about visiting museums…<<\\n.\\nUnion Square Ticks all the boxes. It’s also at the crossroads to other wonderful neighborhoods as well .Chelsea to the west, East Village is to the east, Greenwich Village is walkable.\\nYou didn’t mention your budget.\\nIf you can afford the Hyatt Union Square I’d seriously consider this one.\\nW New York City Union Square is also there priced a little lower.\\nThe Standard East village is On the edge of the East Village and is 15 minutes south of union square.\\nI like The Standard EV location, but I would prefer to be up at union square with more subway lines Immediately at my door at all times.\\nFlatiron district/ Nomad Which is just north of Union SquareTicks all those boxes as well. There are lots of\\nhotels there of various price points.\\nEdited: 2:54 pm, September 25, 2021 https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d220243-Reviews-W_New_York_Union_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d17783246-Reviews-Moxy_NYC_East_Village-New_York_City_New_York.html Well located hotel\\nEdited: 3:02 pm, September 25, 2021 The Flatiron District and NoMad are also good. You can walk to Union Square and the Village, or up to Midtown from there.\\nLots of restaurants and bars, shops, Madison Square Park, good subway access, it\\'s sort of midway between the FiDi and Central Park. Typically budget rules most hotel decisions. Requesting areas is not always productive because many of the areas people like or recommend either don\\'t have many hotels or are very expensive.\\nI can tell you\\n-There are stores and bars and restaurants in a lot of different areas\\n-if your dates are flexible, the closer you come to Xmas, generally the lower the hotel prices. The beginning of Dec., especially the first weekend, is usually most expensive. Best dates are usually 18-26 Dec.\\nBelow 23 st. Sounds like the areas you\\'d like.

My 12 year old daughter and I are flying to LGA from Chicago at 10:30am on Friday, Oct 1st. What\\'s the best way to get near Times Square from there? Uber? Car Service? We fly out at 6:30 pm on Monday so I\\'m wondering what time we should head back to the airport.\\nAlso, we\\'re booked at Hotel Edison, which I chose due to it\\'s proximity to TS and theaters. We\\'ve got Wicked tickets and would like to hit a few more shows so I wanted to be close. I\\'ve since read some mixed reviews about the hotel and safety of that area. ? We\\'re going to hit up theaters, Central Park, TOTR and a museum or two. I\\'m not set on any part of town but would like to be near theaters. Should I switch You could get some better hotel options if you offer some more information: Number of nights, total budget including taxes and fees, bed configuration wanted. Most people using LGA take taxis or some car service rather than public transportation. Regular taxis are the easiest as one just gets in the line. The fare is based on the meter unlike at JFK. An airport access fee has now been imposed and the regular taxi thought to be cheaper. The problem with car services can be meeting them. The airport is under heavy construction and the car service pick-up area changed at times.\\nhttps://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides Sure thing. We\\'ll be there for 3 nights. A king bed is fine. I\\'d like to stay under $300/ night. I like to take a taxi from LGA as the official taxi line is easy to find and a car service (I\\'ve used Carmel and Dial7) to get back in order to schedule the car at the precise time I need it.\\nYour flight being at 6:30pm, I would arrange to be back at the airport by 5pm very latest so leaving the city at 4pm would leave you plenty of time.\\nI don\\'t know the Edison Hotel specifically but have stayed in that area as a solo female traveller and I do not find it to be dangerous in any way.\\nEdited: 8:55 am, September 09, 2021 For all my 8 trips to nyc the Park Central hotel at 7th and 57th across from Carnegie Hall has been a delight. They have double bed rooms so always perfect if girlfriend or child with you. Close to Broadway and Rockefeller P and Central Park….great location…\\nFor LgA I always left 3 hrs before flight from hotel and always worked out. I always booked the 8:00 pm flight to give me another day nyc.\\nSuper shuttle is reasonable and good and it drops others off also so that’s why cheaper….or carmel cab I have used….have fun Super Shuttle is not a good option, especially going back to the airport and may not be running now anyway.\\nI also like the location of the Park Central, north of Times Square but still walkable and less frenetic area. M Social is also in that area and closer to Wicked than the Edison. If you join the Millenium frequent guest program it,s well under your budget and nicer than the Edison. For general interest, I heard on the radio that our new governor wants to review the LGA Airtrain. The bids are not due till 2022. when I go LGA to NYC I take a taxi right from the airport. it\\'s the most straightforward option, in my opinion. it\\'s about $40 but I\\'m late at night so zero traffic. Want to see Christmas lights in Dyker Heights. What is best method? How far for a taxi ride? Should we just book a bus tour? Bus tours are the easiest, but it\\'s also possible to get there via the subway.\\nThe two trains that would get you there are the R train and the D train. Both would require a walk from the station to get to the lights though. Or a B1 bus from the R train 86th St station (I\\'ve done that, it\\'s easy).\\nTake a look at google maps by putting in \"Dyker Heights Christmas Lights\" and the transit option.\\nEdited: 12:50 am, September 27, 2021 HI! What are the best hotel choices close to Javitts Center that are:\\nA nice hotel with parking that is a safe short walk to and from the Javitts Center?\\nThanks much! Our hotel experts can provide better information than what I can. You might note the nearby #7 train terminus at W. 34th St. that opened in recent years and provides rapid service to the Times Square and Grand Central areas. You might look at the Courtyard Manhattan/Midtown West or the Sheraton Four Points/Manhattan Midtown West . Both are very close to each other and about a 6 minute walk to the Javits Center and about a 3 minute walk to the 7 train station that Fox mentioned.\\nThe Courtyard is newer with better reviews.\\nBoth have off-site parking. The Courtyard mentions $50 a day and the Sheraton Four Points says $37 a day.\\nI will give you the links as there are many of each of these brands in the city, it’s easy to get confused.:\\nhttps://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycjj-courtyard-new-york-manhattan-midtown-west/\\nhttps://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycmf-four-points-manhattan-midtown-west/\\nIf neither of these meet your needs, (budget or otherwise), please give some more details of what you are looking to spend or other needs. It is a safe neighborhood. Anything you find that meets your definition of a “short walk” should work for you Very few hotels in NYC have their own garage. Those that offer parking in the room rate often take the car to nearby garages and charge a premium for the convenience. You can find garages in the area by using sites like\\nSpothero.com\\nBestparking.com\\nYou can even reserve a space if you prepay.\\nHotels near Javits are\\nCourtyard Midtown West\\nFairfield Inn Midtown West\\nFour Points Midtown West\\nYotel\\nPestana CR 7 (new)\\nArlo Midtown West (new)\\nIf you’re on a tight budget, you could consider staying at the Shaeration Lincoln Harbor in weehawken, NJ. They do have parking and there\\'s a ferry near the hotel that connects to Manhattan and drop off right near the Javits Center. The Pendry Manhattan West hotel is a very new hotel and likely the closest to the convention center. Their rates are astonishing and not for the budget-minded.\\nhttps://www.pendry.com/manhattan-west/ I don\\'t mean to sound unwelcoming, but you are making some ... well ... suburban assumptions about the Javits Center. It was built in an industrial area with little housing or hotel infrastructure, and the few open parking lots have been re-developed with buildings that yield more money than parking does. If you revealed your home city in your profile, we could give you a comparison. Also, parking is a scarce and expensive commodity in Manhattan.\\nYou might wonder why they would build a convention center without hotels or parking. Well, it\\'s already been asked, why did they build a convention center that was too small to compete with its obvious competition?\\nAll that said, Manhattan is much safer than you think it is. In the 1960s, when Manhattan was far grittier than it is today, there was a respected Young Ladies residence near the ramp to the Lincoln Tunnel on the north side West 34th Street. I went for foreign language tutoring with a Grad student who lived there. In addition to the old opera house where I think AGT or one of those tapes, there is a big curbside bus depot much closer to the Javits, also on 34th.\\nHowever, in winter, the Javits is a very chilly walk, often uphill, to midtown where the hotels are. The subway station is a great improvement, but it\\'s a slog with large luggage. You\\'ll be exiting at your hotel in a more crowded station that may not have as many escalators or elevators. You can also park your vehicle at the NJ ferry and then take the ferry in to a Manhattan hotel (there is a free shuttle bus if hotel not within walking distance of the dock) http://www.nywaterway.com/IndoorParkingGarage.aspx\\nEdited: 3:04 pm, September 26, 2021 #6 - If you mean the https://websterapartments.org/ for women - it\\'s still there Actually Obs, a number of these hotels are relatively new to very new and not that far. The area has improved because of Hudson Yards. There is a ton of ongoing development in the vicinity of the javits center. Not the most fascinating area but it is nowhere near as isolated as it once was and with all the development I think that trend will accelerate further. Hi! My husband and I have a very quick kid-free weekend Nov 12-14 and are going to New York to celebrate our 20th anniversary. We love upscale/boutique hotels with a good bar, but not necessarily a loud club scene as we are late 40s. I\\'ve been to the city quite a few times but usually have one or more kids with me. This time, I\\'d like to stay south of midtown - maybe Soho, East Village, Meatpacking, etc. I\\'ve stayed at the Roxy in Tribeca, but usually stay in Chelsea or midtown, so not as familiar with the hotels in the areas I\\'m thinking about. We would love a king bed and to stay under $600/night. We are fully vaxxed. Even with my geographic ideas, there are still so many options - what hotels do you think would fit the bill? Thank you! The Carlyle might be a good option if you want to be close to The MET and upper East Side.\\nEdited: 12:12 am, September 26, 2021 I don\\'t know if the Greenwich hotel is within your budget, it\\'s typically quite pricey. Lovely hotel, upscale with a quiet vibe. Great location in Tribeca. If you liked the location of the Roxy, you\\'ll like this one.\\nThe Standard East Village perhaps? Not quite as upscale though, but it looks nice. Hi - I took a quick look on booking.com and came up with some spots to research. One is just slightly over-budget, but other than that, they meet the location, price, and stylish boutique criteria (including taxes and fees).

I lived in the West Village for 15 years, but it’s been over a decade since then and I know how quickly the city changes. So I am hoping for input on new and interesting places to visit and dine. These kids are very savvy and well mannered young people and are open to any kind of new experience; be it drag bingo, Korean karaoke or avant- grade theater. I know it’s a large group that doesn’t always lend itself to a lot of NYC’s more intimate spaces, but we are willing to divide up. I am very familiar with the city, so no need for any of the “normal” recommendations. Just new cool stuff and restaurants. A fun brunch place recommendation would also be appreciated. I was hoping for an eating with Ziggy food tour, but he seems to have hung up his sign. Thank you in advance for any recommendations. Little Island, without a doubt.\\nhttps://www.idealist.org/en/nonprofit/6fca3e57b47f41a28991377502e977cb-little-island-nyc-new-york\\nAsk the kids to research travel blogs.

These are fantastic suggestions! Thank you so much. Check out Time Out New York a few days before you arrive to see what events are going on. Given that is a lot of teen girls it will foreclose access to many bar/lounge/club spaces. Seems like the best thing would be to focus on special events that are always going on in NYC, unique museum exhibits and dining experiences that offer experiences in addition to the food like Risa mentioned.\\nOn my list of things to do is to check out Mexican food in sunset park. I always felt it was a bit more difficult to find authentic mexican food in nyc compared to finding some other international foods, but this may be the ticket. Can be combined with a visit to Greenwood cemetery or industry city etc.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I7W84g1OyY&t=2s\\nWhile not necessarily a special event if you are in the downtown brooklyn area (ie visiting Brooklyn bridge/Manhattan bridge, brooklyn heights etc) I do recommend DeKalb food hall. The video just shows a couple of the vendors there but their vendors are extremely varied with foods from all around the world ( I find this food hall cuisine to be more diverse than some of the other more tourist food halls). The sushi is high quality and I want to try the arepas mentioned in the video below. Food here is good quality but a bit expensive.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9pehQYtu2Q&t=1s So what placed did you visit? We go next weekend! I will let you know. My family is going to NYC for the third time. My daughters, 19 & 18 want to do Times Square again, but my husband and I don\\'t care for it. In the general vicinity, what are your favorite people watching locations, bars, cafes, etc.... that we can chill out at while they wander around? Thanks in advance.

Brooklyn Diner is not a diner. It is an overpriced casual restaurant. Diners don\\'t charge $4 for coffee, or $22 for a hot dog. It does depend on time of day and time of year. The rooftop bar at the Knickerbocker Hotel is nice if they\\'re open. Bar Centrale mentioned by Risa requires a reservation and afaik, is only open pre and post theater. During the day in good weather, Bryant Park or one of bars or restaurants there is another idea. La a grande Boucherie is another idea\\nhttps://boucherie.nyc/about-our-french-restaurants/ I looked it up before I posted it, Whiz (and included the link, but here it is again http://barcentrale.nyc/contact).

Even better when someone tells you about it “on the QT”, like we heard about it,\\nAnd Brooklyn Diner is a tourist’s idea of a diner. It isn’t bad, but it is crazy expensive for what it is. I’ve been to NYC (2020) but my boyfriend hasn’t. We will arrive on 10/22 and depart that Sunday.\\nWe wanted to see Little Shop of Horrors, but they are sold out. We are going to see Waitress on Saturday afternoon. We are staying at Park Central Hotel. Any recommendations for hidden gems for sights to see or hidden restaurants?

Seen someone post that their Manchester to NYC for Nov 4th trip has today been cancelled (flight is still on sale) but I’m starting to wonder how quickly they’ll get up and running and at what frequency per week?\\nAnyone booked on\\nVS127 in November/December Wouldn’t it make more sense to post this on a Manchester forum? Or call the airline. Have any other airlines resumed flights on that route? I think American Airlines was one of the first to operate nonstops on that route, at least 25 or 30 yrs ago. Delta added it at least 20 yrs ago and United after that. But some of these were only seasonal to begin with, and with the Delta variant now apparently affecting winter bookings (a couple of Wall St analysts just downgraded some airline stocks for this reason), they may be reluctant to restart that route. Have you checked to see what the US carriers are doing? I would post this query on Flyertalk.com\\nhttps://www.flyertalk.com/ By the way, Delta partners with Virgin, so I would hope that if Delta was operating and VS wasn\\'t, they would put you on the DL flight.\\nEdited: 3:19 pm, September 25, 2021 Post 1 I could understand why you may think that, but your opinion is an easy one to have when you live in NYC many thousands of NYC enthusiasts will have to get there from Manchester so it very much belongs here. Hi we have booked Virgin Manchester to NY on 3rd December\\nWhen I took a gamble mid January just after the lockdown to book on a £30 cancellable fee , the agent told me they were still flying once a day to NY and on that particular day they had 81 people travelling! He said they had never stopped that flight and had never had less than 56 on board I assume people were flying outwards from JFK or they were so many people with exemptions. The main reason to continue the flight was cargo carrying!\\nSo it never crossed my mind to query whether our flights were valid - but maybe I should Thanks for alert. Post 7\\nThe travel agent lied to you, there has only ever been one VA flight to leave Manchester per day pre pandemic the VS127 and it hasn’t taken off since late March 2020 for repatriation flights and is currently cancelled up to and including 30th October The nonstop has apparently been canceled (although it\\'s still showing up on their website), but on that date (per Virgin\\'s website), it appears that they have 3 non stops to JFK, and their codeshare partner (Delta) has 1 out of LHR.\\nIf traveling to LHR isn\\'t a possibility, it looks like Virgin has connections through AMS or CDG that day.\\nAt this point, I doubt if MAN-LHR comes back before the late spring or summer (if it hasn\\'t already been reinstated). We know that airlines trim their international flying through the winter.\\nEdited: 8:54 am, September 26, 2021 Find this strange!\\nHe booked me an exceptional deal and my flights are showing\\nYou have me panicking now!\\nAnyone any info relating to this ?\\nNot to dispute the validity of your answer but where did you find this information?\\nThanks Hello,\\nHere are my couple of options-\\n1. Dream midtown - close to Central Park plus has a rooftop\\n2. Park central - close to Central Park but seems old. Are the bathrooms nice?\\n3. Shelburne by affina - far from the Central Park but best rate from Costco\\n4. Crowne plaza hy36 - looks newer but is in midtown- not walking distance to Central Park, but might be to many restaurants\\n5. Hilton garden inn Central Park - can get a room with terrace here in similar price point, though not sure how useful that will be in October\\nAre there any that are newer/cleaner compared to the other in this list?\\nWould love to stay near restaurants or walk to Central Park.\\nJust not sure if either of them are in neighborhoods that locals are avoiding coz of homelessness or what not.\\nOriginally wanted to stay in UWS or UES but I’m not finding anything for my dates in my price range.\\nDates - Oct 9th-15th 2021\\nPrice range - $150-$250 per night including taxes etc\\nFor 2 adults who are there to explore the city (have been many times before)\\nOpen to other suggestions too. I am also leaning towards Tribeca/Chelsea after reading the posts here. Is Sheraton Tribeca highly rated by folks here? I know it is not close to central park but hoping we can explore the nightlife, eateries, boutiques around here None of these are near where the homeless problem was but all except the Affinia Shelburne and the Hyatt have some scathing reviews about dirty rooms or poor customer service. I know it,s confusing when the reviews are not uniform, but of this list, the Affinia a Shelburne looks to be the best option. If the Sheraton a tribeca is within budget, that\\'s ok too.\\nThese hotels are all in midtown which is defined as 34 st. To 59 st. And all are within walking distance of Central Park although the 2 I\\'m suggesting are further than the others. They\\'re also near Bryant Park. Hello all, here is my trip report from August. I love reading everyone\\'s reports because I learn something from each one or get new ideas. When I heard Springsteen on Broadway was coming back, I knew I needed to get a ticket and come back to the city. I was traveling solo and(hate to admit it) am in my mid 50\\'s. This was my 3rd trip to the city. First time was at Thanksgiving, second was at Christmas, so I was very happy to come in the summer and not be all bundled up. The weather was perfect the entire time. Prior to arriving, I had been reading the forum. I also read an online article about \"what to do in NYC this weekend\" to get any last minute ideas and I found a lot in that article. I arrived on Saturday evening, Aug 14th, about 7:30 pm. I decided to take a taxi because I did not want to deal with luggage and steps for the AirTrain. My flight had been delayed and I was disappointed because my plan was to go to a free concert in either Central Park or Bryant Park but it was too late. I checked in to my hotel, The Warwick, and decided to walk to Times Square. I love to see all the lights but I found it a little bit chaotic and a little seedy. Now that marijuana is legal, the entire area smelled like \\'reefer madness\" I headed to Hard Rock Cafe to buy a couple shirts and then headed back to the hotel. Stopped at Ray\\'s Pizza to buy a couple slices and took them back to my room to eat. DAY 2- Sunday. I had a lot of plans for this day! From the article, I read about a free walking tour of the flatiron district on Sundays at 11am. I definitely wanted to do this. I headed out from my hotel and walked down 6th avenue the entire way to the Flatiron building. I stopped at the Chelsea flea market and went over to walk thru the flower district. I got to the Flatiron building early so I wandered into Eataly, then back to the Harry Potter store(long line) and waited at the tables for 11 am. The tour started exactly at 11. It covers Madison Square Park and the surrounding buildings. Not too much walking and a ton of information. I then wanted to find Dominique Ansel\\'s workshop to see these famous goodies I have heard about. Of course, by the time I arrived, all of the fun flavors were sold out. Only regular chocolate and almond croissant remained. I passed. Then I went back to Eataly to try to get in for lunch at their rooftop restaurant, Serra by Birreria. I was lucky and was able to go right up! After lunch, I headed towards Hudson yards, to the Vessel. I was only able to take photos, then went inside the mall to cool down for a few minutes. Went over to walk the High Line. Needed to book an online time to head south. That only took a minute and then I was on and walking down to the end. I decided to exit right before the end and headed over to the river. I walked down to Little Island to get a look at it. There were no times to get in for that day but I was not planning on going in anyway. Headed back towards Chelsea piers as I had booked a sunset sail with Classic Harbor Line, that I read about on a previous trip report. I was early, so I walked around the park and sat and watched helicopters landing and taking off. Boarded America 2.0 for the sail and we had 1 free drink included in the price. The sail was so worth every cent. Weather was great and the sunset was beautiful. Looking at the city all lit up on the way back was so pretty. Once we returned to shore, I decided to walk back. Walked past Citrovia and then up 7th ave. Got back to the hotel and collapsed, 33,694 steps! DAY 3- perhaps a little too much yesterday, so I decided to keep it close to the hotel today. Luckily, the hotel has a fabulous location! Headed out to Magnolia Bakery to pick up treats and banana pudding...yes, this was my breakfast. Took my haul back to the hotel and decided to walk over to 5th avenue and look at some stores. Went into Tiffany\\'s and purchased an early birthday present for myself. Went back to hotel and rested. Then headed to the MOMA after 11am. Monday\\'s 9am-11 are for members only. Since I was just figuring it out as I went, I didn\\'t have a pre-booked time. I told the guard and he said no problem and they let me go inside and buy a ticket for entry. I can\\'t say that I enjoyed this museum so I didn\\'t spend too much time there. After leaving, I grabbed a hot dog from the cart on the corner and went back to the hotel. I had booked a combo tour of Rockefeller Center for 5pm and top of the Rock at 6:30. I went early and looked around the area and shopped in FAO Schwarz. Tour is really all about the artwork on the outsides of the buildings and inside the lobbies. They explain what everything stands for in the murals. I think you could definitely skip it, if you are not into artwork. All of the other information they talk about is on the signs inside Top of the Rock. Headed up to Top of the Rock and waited around for an hour hoping to see the sunset. That night was a bit cloudy so no great colors to see but the view of the buildings is fantastic! I was glad I went up early as it gets really crowded at sunset/dusk time. Headed back to the hotel and changed into some nicer clothes to go to dinner at a place I passed on the first night, La Grande Boucherie. I walked over and was seated right away. Lots of open tables. The service was excellent as was my meal. I would recommend highly! DAY 4- woke up and decided to head to the Today show. I had watched it the day before and didn\\'t see too many people outside, so I thought I would try it. I got there about 7:30 and not a lot of people were there. I heard they were coming out to the plaza at 8:30, so I stayed there and watched. Took photos and was excited to see them all when they came out at 8:30. They were all so nice to all of the fans, posing for photos and chatting to many of them in the front row. Hoda seems like she truly loves talking to everyone. I was glad I did it! Then went over to Kate Spade to buy a new handbag. Yes, they just sent in a new collection with I love NY on the bags. Of course, I had to buy one. Took it back to the hotel. I had nothing else planned for the daytime, so I decided to walk down 5th avenue and admire the architecture. I walked down to the Morgan library, which was closed but did see many beautiful buildings along the way. I had read about a collection of costumes on display on 42nd street, to raise money for Broadway employees that had been out of work. I went over but it was not open(rookie mistake,not checking before) Headed back to the hotel to rest. I had tickets for Springsteen for Tuesday night. I had planned to eat dinner at my hotel restaurant prior but they had a little problem, so no dinner before the show. The show was awesome and I was so glad I bought the ticket! After the show, I was so hungry but didn\\'t know what would be open on the walk home, so I went over to Juniors and had a turkey dinner. Went back to the hotel. DAY 5- Got up and packed up everything. Checked out and went to subway station a couple blocks away, took it to Air Train and then back to JFK. Wonderful trip and I will be back at Thanksgiving, hoping to see the parade! Thanks for your report. I hope you had a good trip. But honestly, without any paragraph breaks, it’s too difficult for me to read. Honestly, where there’s a will there’s a way. I think if you really wanted to read it you could’ve. I lost the plot at \"I was at Dominique Ansel\\'s Workshop but didn\\'t buy anything.\" Why? Why? What a fun trip report! Lots of sweets! Good thing you did all of that walking! Wasn\\'t Bruce amazing? Loved that he did Fire with Patti.\\nDid you have a hard time fitting your shopping into your luggage on the way back? Glad you\\'ll be back soon! You packed a lot into your days! A little bit of everything. Thank you for sharing your trip with us. Great trip report! I enjoyed reading it. Thanks for sharing. Thank you for sharing! Excellently planned. Beneficial info for our soon forthcoming 1st NYC adventure. nice trip. Thanks for your trip report. Morning, so excited we have booked New York direct from Manchester. I came as a 15 year old as my sister worked here. Now 40 years on I\\'m returning with husband and daughter. We have preliminary booked Renaissance times square good deal as I think being within walking distance will suit us. My question is what attractions are fully open? Plan is to visit\\nEmpire state\\nStatue of liberty\\nMacys for the daughter 5th ave\\nMy husband enjoys churches and as he has never been it would good to see a few chapels.\\nWe have 5 nights maybe a show if running.\\nI don\\'t want to be rushing around happy to find a good Rooftop bar any reccomendations? We are all vaccinated had covid. Is there a tourist card for metro. Sorry for all the questions. Daughter is 25 so all OK for a good new york cocktail. Many thanks ESB and SoL are open, book in advance, though.\\nSeven day subway pass for reach of you makes good sense. Almost all attractions are open although check to see if you need to book in advance. As was stated, the Status of Liberty needs booking & ASAP.. Check St Patrick\\'s Cathedral & St John the Divine to see if they are funning tours. Although it is not a rooftap, River Cafe in Brooklyn has a panoramic view of Manhattan. You could also see if the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center is open. January means winter, so keep that in mind. Yes we are aware of the cold, don\\'t mind perhaps some ice skating at Central Park Excellent, great idea. Enjoy your trip. Can i ask which airline you booked a direct flight with from Manchester? I usually get the United 9an flight into Newark from Manchester but United have dropped that flight Yes, aer lingus have started from October brand new aircraft we paid £383 return. They also fly Manchester barbados. Taken over some of the slots left by delta, United, Thomas cook. Coming back to NYC with teen daughter, this will be our 3rd time and we are staying 4 nights.\\nI have narrowed down to: Arlo Midtown, M Social TS and Pestana CR7 TS. I tend to like newish/renovated hotels and they usually have budget friendly, promo pricing. All 3 come in at around 220 USD/night with taxes and resort fees included so not really a differentiator here. In order of preference, my thoughts are:\\n- Arlo Midtown: I always wanted to stay at an Arlo property - I love their concept but it\\'s always been over my budget so this might be my chance to try it out. I know the area is not the prettiest ( stayed at Pod TS previously) but I can live with it and I do like the proximity to Hudson Yards, theatre and Hell\\'s Kitchen eateries. A big draw here is the rooftop patio for views and I hear the city view rooms also have pretty decent views? (hoping to get something on the 25 floor). Hotel seems to be well reviewed on here, albeit mostly from 1 time contributors, so taking it with a grain of salt. But judging on their other locations, seems to be a well liked chain with good customer service.\\n- M Social - I like the location better and obviously the views are a big draw here (both from rooms and the rooftop). However I\\'m reading although the hotel got a facelift some areas/rooms still have the old carpeting/peeling wallpaper and look a bit rundown. Seems to attract a younger crowd and may have more of a party vibe, many reviews mention pot smoking and customer service being less than stellar. Although I do want a young, hip hotel, I think this one may be a little too much style over substance?\\n- Pestana CR7 - same area as Arlo, so not the best, but I do like the new, modern vibe. However nothing really stands out about it (other than being in my budget). I believe there are no views to be had here as the building is surrounded by other taller buildings? No rooftop either. Also not enough reviews to be able to really draw a conclusion on this one.\\nAs other poster on the forum said - I am in a bit of analysis paralysis.Please help :) We have been Greenwich Village denizens for 50+ years. All the teenagers we know love the Village!\\nHere, we like the Washington Square Hotel just across the street from Washington Square Park in the heart of The Village and stay there when family comes to visit NYC and we give them our Village apartment. The area is vibrant with universities and attractions, close to SoHo and Chinatown for shopping, has great outdoor dining and has easily accessible public transportation. Many touristy attractions are within a 1-2 mile stroll from the Hotel.\\nNote: The Washington Square Hotel does not always list all of it\\'s room availabilities on the Internet. We have found that directly contacting the Hotel yields best results.

The nearest subway is Port Authority and there\\'s been a homeless problem there. While I haven\\'t been in the area recently, I just wouldn\\'t pick that location. Looking at your other thread I found your dates. If you’re ok with 1 bed, Citizen M Times Square is a similar vibe to the others in what I consider a better location. The. Courtyard Central Park also looks like it would work. My 2 penneth.\\nEdited: 6:08 pm, September 25, 2021 A recent video showing the area around port authority. My guess is the area is closer to what it was pre-pandemic so if someone is familiar was the area from that time then they know what to expect. The homeless have been moved out of the hotels in the area, Broadway has reopened so there is an increase in foot traffic and I think the police have pushed the issues further south down near Penn station to make room for the Broadway crowds. It was never a great area late at night (like after midnight) and I would think that still holds true, but most of the issues that led to problems in the area have been at least somewhat addressed.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybFzIscGUQ Seeing that you like modern hotels, another one to throw into the mix is the CitizenM Times Square. It\\'s on 50th St so a 10 min walk from Times Square, closer to Central Park.\\nIs it just you and your daughter? That is, two people? The CitizenM hotels only have one King bed in all rooms, so if there will be more than two people it won\\'t suit.\\nI don\\'t know their rates either because I don\\'t know your exact dates.\\nhttps://www.citizenm.com/hotels/united-states/new-york\\nBut out of the three you have listed, I would choose the Arlo. The location wouldn\\'t bother me. It\\'s actually good for eating on 9th Ave. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 9:04 am, September 26, 2021 Thanks all. Yes, I am familiar with the Port Authority area - we stayed nearby pre-pandemic in 2018 for 6 nights, and it was our go to station. Many homeless but never felt unsafe or bothered. Still, I agree it\\'s not a nice area.\\nLove the CitizenM concept but I think it will be really cramped for the 2 of us and I don\\'t care for the sink in the room. But would definitely pick for a solo trip.\\nI have looked at both Residence Inn and Courtyard Central Park and they are unfortunately over budget.\\nIt\\'s funny, I keep trying to branch out and try other areas (many of the eateries I\\'ve mapped out are in the Village/LES area) but somehow I end up midtown. Perhaps less choice of cheaper hotels there (Moxy LES has been on my radar but always over my budget). Without knowing your budget, it\\'s hard to suggest something else. But, A few years ago we branched out and tried the UWS. I will have a hard time staying anywhere else now! Arthouse is our go to. They run good sales (I get their emails). Sometimes it\\'s worth just paying a bit more too. :) Our first trip we stayed in Pod 52 so I understand the desire to keep hotel spending low. One of your problems is you’re coming the weekend of Comic Con so prices are higher. In fact it,s at the Javits Center which is very near the hotels you picked. I did a search on booking.com and I think also on TripAdvisor. One of them is where’s I saw a price for the Courtyard CP around $1000.\\nIs there a big difference in the size of rooms at Arlo and Pestana vs Citizen M? They all look small to me.\\nEdited: 9:29 am, September 26, 2021 Hi I have a free loaner car for the day I am getting from Columbus Circle at the end of October. I can get it on a Friday or Saturday. Would like to drive over Brooklyn Bridge and see some cute NY neighborhood homes with fall foliage, kinda what you see in the movies. Dont want to be gone all day. Just a few hours in total. Anywhere close worth the drive if I have the car? Thanks Depends on what you mean by the end of October. The very end of October will like be post peak for anywhere in short driving distance. If you are talking around October 25th you may be able to catch some leaves out on long island. Leaves are already changing at high elevations. Check condition reports a couple days before your travels to see where color is peaking at that time. A month out it is very hard to predict, like predicting the weather a month out. Fully agree to check a few days before. Also, weather as well, how enjoyable would this be if it was raining the days you plan to do this. I know a free loaner car sounds good, but within the city, a car could be a major hinderance. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13673962-Fall_foliage_report-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHere is a link to the fall foliage report from NYS. Please note, I live in the Central region of New York State & our peak is usually mid-October. NYC\\'s peak is later & you never know what the timing of the leaves will be until it happens. If you decide against driving, there are Fall Foliage cruises that leave from Manhattan and go up the Hudson River for a couple of hours. Some include brunch or lunch, some are on sail boats, some are on smaller yachts.\\nIt might be a better way to see foliage at the end of October rather than bits here and there in Brooklyn.\\nHere is one company offering foliage cruises: https://sail-nyc.com/browse-by-theme/fall-foliage/ Really appreciate this info. I will check the cruises out! This is great! I saved the link! Appreciate it! Go to Bear Mountain St Park I just thought of Brooklyn Botanic Garden that has run fall foliage tours in the past in the first week of November, so late October could already have some lovely fall foliage trees.\\nhttps://www.bbg.org/visit/fall_highlights\\nProspect Park could also be another option. This article was posted in mid October 2017, so end of October could have nice vistas as well:\\nhttps://www.prospectpark.org/news-events/news/fall-foliage/\\nThe nearby neighbourhoods near these sights could have nice pockets of coloured trees and nice homes and streets.\\nIf you drive or take a cruise, it would be a nice day out. love this! i am saving! TY! I wonder if anyone can help? We are staying at Sheraton Times Square and want to get there as cheaply as possible from JFK. I know we need to get the Air Train to Jamaica and then get the subway (I think the line goes directly to the subway station next to our hotel) or the LIRR to Penn Station. My questions are, is the subway doable with luggage or is it a total nightmare? I\\'ll have my 14 year old son with me too and his bags. And if we decided to take the LIRR instead, would taxisbe prepared to take us the reasonably short distance to our hotel? Thanks in advance. The subway is not a \"nightmare\" with luggage unless you have too much. You can take the AirTrain, then the E train to the 7th Avenue station, which is just a block from your hotel. The only caveat is that there is no elevator at that station - I\\'m not sure about escalators - so you would need to carry your luggage up at least one flight of stairs. You\\'re coming here and spending money for airfare, hotel, attractions, etc. If I were in your shoes, I\\'d factor in a taxi ride from the airport to your hotel as part of the cost.\\nTaxis are fixed from JFK to anywhere in Manhattan, might be the best $70 to $75 (including tip/toll) you ever spent. I prefer taking the LIRR. Much easier in my opinion! But the LIRR requires another change, either to the subway or taxi, and is more expensive. The OP asked for \"as cheaply as possible\". >And if we decided to take the LIRR instead, would taxisbe prepared to take us the reasonably short distance to our hotel? Thanks in advance.<\\nYes. Get in a taxi. Then tell them your destination. They are required to take you .They may or may not not like short trips , they are required to do it.\\nEdited: 3:14 pm, September 25, 2021 Thanks everyone for your responses that\\'s so helpful:-D Been on TA for years and have had much help all over the world. I just wanted to thank each of you that have helped my daughter and I plan what I am sure what will be another great visit to NYC!\\nEdited: 9:07 pm, September 24, 2021 So appreciated!\\nHave a wonderful trip! Have a great trip!! When are you visiting NYC? Looks like you may have some great weather!\\nCH Thank you back! Looking forward to hearing about your trip and the various places you visit. I am very much looking forward to the weather. Still real hot in Florida! Does carmel limo have Office at JFK terminal 4? Or I have to book online in advance?\\nI will choose to take carmel limo as it will more cheaper than the cap since we are 5 people and 1 infant with 5 luggages There is a lot of demand - book in advance on line! Don\\'t even think of waiting until you arrive. Thanks Risa\\nI just finish my booking, i am confused with number\\nThey sent an email once I ready I’ve to call\\n800-9-CARMEL\\nIs it the same number of 800-9227635? Yes, it is. Simply the numeric version of the words. We use Carmel Limo frequently, although we normally book on their app or website: www.CarmelLimo.com\\n(But we have been using them since pre-internet days, when we used to call their local phone number instead. Their local phone number is heard often on their TV commercials in NYC: (212) 666-6666. I guess you have the toll free 800 number instead.)\\nDefinitely book in advance, sometimes they do not have cars available at the last minute.\\nEdited: 5:18 pm, September 25, 2021 Could anyone tell me if there are any bars open in Midtown Manhattan on Christmas Day. Some may be closed but many are open. Would you know the name of any bar that is open for sure? There are too many to name - there\\'s something like 26000 restaurants in NYC & an equal number of bars, I suppose. What sort of bar are you looking for & in what area(s.)\\nEdited: 1:00 pm, September 25, 2021 Wait a couple months to see what is open.\\nHotel bars are likely to be open There are usually workaday bars open near transit hubs like bus and train stations. Also anywhere there are people who like to start drinking at 9 or 10 in the morning. Higher end places more likely to be closed or have reduced hours (except hotels, though keep in mind some hotel bars remain closed for pandemic related reasons, just like some hotel restaurants, gyms, etc remain closed). Hi Everyone\\nI have searched through the forums, but I cant find anything recent, and I understand things have changed a lot recently.\\nWe are travelling to NYC in December, and one of our party has Coeliac.\\nWe can generally cobble something together for our evening meal (although recommendations are welcome), but we are struggling to find breakfast places that have gluten free options. Usually we would fill up at breakfast, then eat again on the evening, so need places that do a decent selection.\\nWe\\'re not after anything fancy, just places you can get a decent breakfast with GF available too.\\nI know alot of places have closed recently, or are taking the GF options from the menu, but does anyone have any recommendations at all?\\nWe are staying 35th/36th street, but dont mind a bit of travelling if needed.\\nThanks in Advance\\nGill Ohh I got you!\\nI am literally sitting here eating a caprese sandwich on GF focaccia from my favorite favorite GF bakery, Modern Bread & Bagel, which is at 83rd and Columbus. It\\'s 100% GF and their bagels are AMAZING. also their sister restaurant nextdoor, Thyme & Tonic, is also 100% GF and is a great place for weekend brunch or dinnerI\\nhttps://www.modernbreadandbagel.com/\\nhttps://www.thymeandtonic.com/\\nThere is also Senza Gluten in the village, which has a sit-down restaurant and also a cafe down the street that\\'s more lunchy/bakery like. Senza is phenomenal GF Italian food and I love going there.\\nOther faves:\\nFriedmans. There are 9 of these throughout the city now and they\\'re awesome, esp for breakfast/brunch. They\\'re not exclusively GF but they can make pretty much everything GF and they\\'re very knowledgeable and safe.\\nNizza, Italian, has an extensive GF menu\\nCafe 82, a diner on the UWS at 82 and Brodway with a great GF diner menu\\n5 Napkin Burger, several locations, has a dedicated fryer and GF buns\\nBareburger, several locations, also has a dedicated fryer and GF buns\\nBistango, Italian, can make pretty much anything GF\\nLili & Loo, has a great GF Chinese menu, very American Chinese but hard to find elsewhere!\\nRed Farm and Han Dynasty are Chinese restaurants with good GF options, you just have to ask\\nThis is by no means exhaustive, just what comes to mind right now. Let me know if you have any other types of food or location-specific requests! Oh my gosh, I think I love you! ha ha.\\nThank you so much for the recommendations (especially the Chinese as we love it), I\\'m off to google them all now and look at the menus.\\nIt\\'s my Mum that has Coeliac, she does like an Italian, Chinese and Indian. Breakfast, we\\'re typical UK tourists in the US usually, with pancakes, bacon, eggs etc. She will usually opt for the omlette if we were at a chain like iHop, but I want her to have proper options to fill up on. My Dad and I aren\\'t restricted, so I like to try and get ideas ahead of time so we\\'re not scrambling to find anywhere on the hop 35/36 st. and where? In NYC you always need a cross st. For reference. I\\'m assuming you’re on the west side but where? There\\'s a Friedman’s (mentioned above) at Herald Square. If iHop usually works, I\\'d think diners or coffee shops could be an option? Or have you looked at some of those and ruled them out? Just asking in case you want some suggestions or not. We’ve 2 hotels, Crowne Plaza on 36th and the Hilton Garden Inn on 35th by Empire State I’ve looked at some, but I’ve literally just walked around on google maps to check them.\\nNone mention GF at all, so im presuming that we wouldn’t be able to get her toast or a sandwich at all. I could contact some of the ones I can find good reviews for though There are so many restaurants that offer gluten free food that it’s hard to respond. Many pizza places, many higher end restaurants - it’s marked right on the menu. Today, it’s pretty easy to find gluten free options. If you have specific places you’re interested in, please mention. (It’s also on their websites). Hi Risa\\nThanks for replying.\\nIn the nicest way possible, I am doing my own research, and looking for places, however a lot have stopped serving GF during the pandemic and I’m finding it impossible to find breakfast options in particular.\\nThat’s why I’ve asked on here for recommendations from people who are there now, or who have visited recently. They (especially those who live there and need a coeliac diet) will be aware of the places still offering GF options.\\nI can’t name places as I’ve not been for 14 years, and the places I’m finding via google, blogs, vlogs or Instagram hashtag searches are either no longer offering GF, or are really high end places that we wouldn’t visit anyway.\\nJust calling in places once we get there to see if they can offer options doesn’t work right now, so I’m trying to be better prepared with options to stop my Mum becoming seriously ill.\\nI hope that explains better why I’m asking for any general information or suggestions I typically like regular diners for breakfast - I\\'m like you and prefer on most days a heavier breakfast and heavier dinner when traveling (with some exceptions on some days). Since I don\\'t eat gluten free nor having visited since the pandemic struck, my suggestion will need some more research by you to see what they offer. They do have typical diner items with eggs etc.\\nAndrew\\'s Coffee Shop and Skylight Diner are both within a 5-7 min walk from the Crown Plaza. Skylight Diner may be my favorite in the area but I\\'ve been to both in the past.\\nChelsea Square a bit further south is one of my favorites in Chelsea.\\nIn Greenwich Village, if you plan to visit, Waverly diner is near both a subway and Washington Square Park. Thank you! I’ve actually emailed the Skylight Diner this morning to see if they offer GF bread, or if there are any rules against her bringing her own to eat with breakfast, as their menu looks amazing.\\nWe did California a couple of years back, some areas it was against the food regulations/laws for her to have her own bread with her food, others it was perfectly fine where they couldn’t provide it. I don’t want to assume it’s ok to do that in NYC.\\nStill currently ploughing through restaurants now so I have a few ready to go options Hi, I\\'ve booked a trip for my boyfriend\\'s 30th. We are heading to New York and arrive new year\\'s eve in the morning. We would like to bring new year in on a rooftop bar or any bar new times Square.\\nI\\'ve enquired at a few places but most tickets for clubs/bars are not released yet and other are $700pp. Just wondered if anyone could recommend the best place which may be more reasonable priced and available to book now or soon. There are no reasonably priced bars near Times Square on New Year\\'s Eve. You need to define what \"reasonable priced\" means to you in USD.\\nThere are loads of bars in the TS borders that may not change much to get in. But they are not rooftop bars. What is you budget? Upstairs at The Kimberley (rooftop bar) used to have a NYE package but I don\\'t know the cost. Maybe contact them or sign up with them for email updates about upcoming events.\\nhttps://www.upstairsnyc.com/\\nThe Magic Hour rooftop bar in the Moxy Times Square hotel also had a NYE package in the past.\\nhttp://moxytimessquare.com/dining/magic-hour-rooftop-bar-lounge/\\nThings may be different this year or back to normal, who knows. Basically, what you are seeing is the going rate for Times Square on New Year\\'s Eve. The problem is that Times Square on New Year\\'s Eve is packed & most places charge a premium even for a basic bar. In (almost) every past year there has been an outdoor event that has a good chance of being held this year: a bike ride to the Central Park fireworks. The event is FREE and perhaps the BEST NYE party in NYC celebrated with thousands of local New Yorkers in the open spaces of Central Park.\\nThere is an annual event that in past years has started in the heart of Greenwich Village at 10:00 PM at Washington Square Park (under the arch) to bike or rollerblade to the Belvedere Castle in Central Park (by 11:45 PM) for music, dance, and fireworks to ring in the New Year. Participants are encouraged to dress festively.\\nFor more information as it becomes available see:\\nhttp://times-up.org/calendar/calendar.php\\nAnd if you decide to forego the bike ride, just come to the general area of the Belvedere Castle in Central Park and ring-in the New Year with hundreds of New Yorkers.\\nEdited: 1:42 pm, September 25, 2021 Morning all! I\\'ve just booked for New York in 6 months time its my first time there.\\nMy main question right now is what type of ID will I need. Will my UK Provisional Drivers License be accepted for bars, pubs, clubs, restaurants etc. I obviously have my passport but wouldn\\'t like to carry it around if were going for cocktails etc im a liability. It really depends on the bar/restaurant/club. Some will accept it and some won\\'t.\\nI think clubs would be the most stringent just because there are probably many more underage people looking to get in. There are thousands of bars and restaurants in NYC. You can find many that won\\'t even check your ID.\\nThe issue, as of today, is that you will need proof of vaccination to eat/drink/club inside those types of establishments. So you will need to show proof, and at many places, corresponding identification. That makes sense. I don\\'t imagine ill be doing much clubbing as there\\'s too much I want to see and do but we might allocate one night to go visit a good club. It\\'s mainly for going to restaurants and sometimes bars after busy days.\\nWell everyone that\\'s going has been double vaccination (One person has the AZ but fingers crossed that\\'s accepted by the time we arrive) and our vaccine letters here have our address on so hopefully having he vaccine letters with address will be fine with drivers license. I have used my provisional license for years in NYC. I also have the covid letter and NHS covid app\\nThis website says that AZ will be accepted in NYC and gives additional info\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page Oh amazing thank you that\\'s really helpful.\\nOh well fingers crossed my provisional and vaccine letter will be sufficient! ID needs a photo\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page Just bring your passport if you want to not worry about getting a drink where and when you want.\\nThe experience of a stranger on the interwebs is pretty much irrelevant because they only went to a tiny percentage of places serving booze and for all you know they are 70 years old and look it. UK Driving licenses may or may not be accepted. I\\'ve had times where they have been curious and not sure - it\\'s not a US license.\\nFor international visitors, I always recommend having your passport. That has never been refused. As of today, there is a vaccination requirement in NYC for sitting/eating inside at bars/restaurants/clubs. So you need to show proof and corresponding ID.\\nEvery bartender/host/etc may not recognize a non US ID/license. So if you are going to a specific place, CALL and confirm what they will accept. You don\\'t want to arrive somewhere and be turned away.\\nThat being said.....there are over 20,000 \"restaurants\" in NYC and loads of bars. You won\\'t go hungry/thirsty! FWIW I’m 40 and get ID’d in the UK (with or without my mask) and have been travelling to the US on the licence for the last 15 years (renewed with the same photo).\\nI normally get questioned about it (because it’s not local and they want to know more) but never been refused, that’s not to say you won’t be but that is my experience ::shrug:: you are rolling the dice. If you are ok with the chance of being turned away at the door you can try to use your license. Never seen a place reject somebody who just had a passport but have seen them reject foreign driver\\'s licenses. Some places may accept it. Others won\\'t. In more touristy areas the chances are the bouncers will be more familiar with UK IDs, just because they see a lot of UK tourists. November 12-15 weekend with my husband for our anniversary. Cannot seem to commit to a hotel. We don’t mind walking everywhere so locations are open-ish. Looking at Kimberley Hotel, Park Terrace Hotel, The Standard east village,\\nBudget around 1000 total or less if possible.\\nDon’t want a tiny room, but 1 queen bed is fine.\\nPlanning on a show, hockey game, and walking exploring. I\\'d be fine with any of those but my choice would be the Park Terrace then The Standard then the Kimberley. I tend to go for more modern hotels buy you may not.\\nHowever, The Park Terrace is a very pretty location overlooking Bryant Park but may not have the restaurants and night life you might like. The Standard East Village would be great for restaurants and nightlife in a younger vibe type of area. The Kimberley is in a quiet area.\\nThe Park Terrace and Kimberley would be great for walking around to the Midtown sights and Central Park. The Standard would be great for walking the Village, East Village, up to Union Square, Flatiron District and even down to SoHo.\\nThe subway will get you around to other areas whatever hotel you choose.\\nThey\\'re all different so I understand the indecisions. Maybe looking at hotel reviews and deciding on what\\'s most important will help. I hate to ask too personal questions but without knowing your ages or tastes it,s hard to advise. The Kimberley and the Standard EV couldn\\'t be more different in location and style so I wonder how you came up with these 3 options? All price based? Ooh this is fun. We’re 40, celebrating our 15th anniversary. I love being in the chaos, my husband not so much- mostly had to twist his arm for this trip.\\nI’ve been reading reviews like crazy and these were the best rated in our range and not right in times sq.\\nGood to know that the hotels I’ve picked are so different lol. . . I’m leaning not The Standard, feels like I’d be too old and we don’t need night life really. Where is the hockey game? If it\\'s at Madison Square Garden, the Park Terrace would be convenient, as you could easily walk there and back. That hotel would also be convenient for theaters. The EV is my favorite area in which to stay. It feels like a neighborhood rather than a business district or a tourist site. Love walking around it and there are so many restaurants. Also, it’s walkable to the LES and the Village. Is this your first trip to NYC? I wouldn’t rule out the Standard. It,s the most interesting location for poking around and not so touristy. The other 2 in midtown are more convenient to theater and hockey. I agree do not rule out the standard EV hotel Especially because you think you’re too old for the area, not so! I love the East Village It’s my favorite neighborhood in all of Manhattan. You can poke around the streets there for days, I do frequently. Eating, drinking, shopping, people watching it’s got it all.And you don’t have to be young to enjoy it I’m certainly not young .20 years older than you guys.\\nEdited: 3:58 pm, September 24, 2021 Getting to the theatre for a show or to Madison Square Garden can be done easily from anywhere as long as you\\'re near a subway station.\\nFor walking around and exploring, staying in a lovely area would be great in my book. For me, that would be the East Village and the Standard hotel from your list. Great area. Lots of restaurants. It\\'s also within walking distance to for example Washington Square Park which is lovely for people watching.\\nHaven\\'t stayed at any of the hotels, so I don\\'t have first hand intel on those. I do love the look of The Standard though - been eyeing it for quite some time now but it\\'s always been over my budget. Seems like a nice boutigue-y kind of place (I like that).\\nSo, for me, this would be an easy pick from your list. Based on my travel style. It is my husbands first time and my second, last time was 15 years ago.\\nMy husband is not keen to take subways but I will work on him.\\nWell now I’m still torn- The Standard or Park Terrace\\nOr lol is there somewhere else in East Village I should consider? Since your husband is not keen to take the subway, I would lean to the Park Terrace. You\\'re within walking distance of a lot of the main tourist sites in midtown and it\\'s a relatively new hotel in a less crazy location. Bryant Park is right outside your door and a nice place to sit and watch the world go by. You can walk to the theater and Madison Square Garden.. Try to book a room with a view and make sure they know it,s your anniversary...that goes for any hotel you book.\\nEdited: 10:38 am, September 25, 2021 It will be my daughter D (18) and her boyfriend G (20) and me (all fully vaccinated). D & G will arrive on Saturday Nov 6th and I will get there on Monday Nov 8 (9.30 p.m. at JFK). We all leave on Saturday Nov 13 (in the morning). We are staying at the Four Points by Sheraton Midtown Times Square, across from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. There are some negatives about this hotel and location, but we got a good deal and we are prepared to live with the negatives.\\nI have been to NYC once before, long ago, and did the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty, so don\\'t feel the need to do those again - happy to look at the SOL from afar, and will try other observation decks. D & G probably will probably go to the SOL before I arrive. My itinerary so far (for the 4 days we are all together) is as follows:\\nNov 8:\\nArrive at 9.30 p.m. - take AirTrain to Howard Beach Station; take A subway (Inwood direction) to 42nd st/Port Authority Station. I know I could take the E train from Jamaica Station, but that track is undergoing work and I am not sure if it will be finished before we arrive (supposed to be done by Nov 2, but could be delayed).\\nTuesday Nov 9:\\n- Top of the Rock/Rockefeller Center at 10 a.m. (first entry time)\\n- Take PATH (JSQ) train to Newport Center - I think at this time of year I\\'d rather do my shopping mostly indoors, as we will be spending a lot of other time outdoors sightseeing. Being from a small island, shopping is a priority. We might be ready to leave by 7 p.m., and in that case will have a nice dinner in midtown after getting the PATH back to 33rd St.\\nWednesday Nov 10:\\n- LABQ for COVID TEST - 59th st & 5th ave mobile unit (south of Central Park)\\n- Central Park - explore the eastern side up to North Woods and back down on the western side; food truck for lunch\\n- explore the Ramble & Belvedere Castle until 3.45\\n- American Museum of Natural History for 4 p.m. entry (last of the day);\\n- When the museum closes at 5.30, walk along 81st or 80th St to Broadway to DSW Shoe to wait out rush hour (since there\\'s none at Newport Center); maybe go down to Lincoln Center to look around\\n- when rush hour passes, head back to midtown via bus or subway for dinner\\nThursday Nov 11:\\n- subway to South Ferry; explore Battery Park, Seaport area and financial district (depending on what time I get up, I may walk a bit of the High Line first and then get the subway from 23rd St)\\n- 9/11 Museum at noon, then walk to City Park and take subway from there to Grand Central\\n- Bryant Park Winter Village - from maybe 4 until 6\\n- Wicked at 7 p.m. (D and I); then maybe meet G afterwards at Bowlmor (he loves arcades)\\nFriday November 12:\\n- Walk to Flatiron & Madison Park; Friends Experience - book for 10 a.m.?\\n- walk down Broadway to Union Square and then to Washington Sq Park to explore the Villages\\n- Little Island at sunset, followed by High Line Park, stopping for dinner along the way\\n- Summit (One Vanderbilt) - 9.00 or 9.30 p.m.\\nSaturday 13th - take taxi to La Guardia\\nOther (not scheduled):\\n- If we find time we might take a ferry - either the free one from Whitehall or the new Staten Island one from midtown.\\n- we are not into art galleries so haven\\'t planned any\\n- we will also be open to Uber/Lyft and yellow cabs if they are more convenient at any time than subway or bus\\n- we don\\'t have a lot of late night stuff, as we can\\'t do bars or clubs. But we might have dinner at 8 a couple of nights and then wander midtown, including Times Square\\nAny comments or suggestions? Thanks in advance! Yes, that area by your hotel is far from optimum, at least you\\'re prepared.\\nPersonally, I would not want to go to a show after the 9/11 Museum.\\nHave flexibility with your days, meaning for the outdoor plans; if it\\'s cloudy, wet, etc.\\nThe walk from Madison Square Park to Union Square is enjoyable, some great buildings, etc. And then yes, enjoy the Village, its a great area to explore.\\nThe term Villages is typically not used, it\\'s either East Village, West Village, Greenwich Village, or just the Village, but you\\'re on the right track. I have a feeling your Central Park day will be cut short because of the amount of walking and how tired you might feel. Plus November could be very cold, getting out of the cold might be welcome. I would plan for an earlier time slot at AMNH, but that\\'s your decision.\\nYour Thursday is a little busy but doable I guess. One thing that stand out, do you want to rest and change before going to Wicked? You\\'ll have been out all day and it\\'s nice to freshen up before a show. Also, you have no dinner plans mentioned, but you can get casual, takeaway style food at the Winter Village.\\nFriday is also a little busy and a lot of walking. If you\\'re OK with that it\\'s fine. ***Plus November could be very cold,***\\nEarly November is still typically nice in terms of temperatures, definitely not very cold. I had a snow day on the 15th! That\\'s cold. And for someone from Barbados, November could feel very frigid. I\\'ve lived here all my life and have never considered once calling November very frigid. I like lots of walking generally speaking, and I prefer to minimize my time indoors with Covid, but if it\\'s getting to be too much there\\'s always transportation options, or we can cut something out. I guess this itinerary is a \"wish list\"? I also don\\'t mind the cold - it\\'s better than being too hot, which is what I\\'ve been suffering with for months. I am really looking forward to a change - I love fall! G will be coming from university in Canada (for his midterm break) where it will be much colder, and D is going to uni in Canada next year so she might as well get used to it. :)\\nThe issue with flexibility these days is that tickets to many things come with date and time reservations attached, so it\\'s harder to move things around. We will take umbrellas and raincoats so that if it is rainy we can still get out and do a few things, even if not as much as we had hoped.\\nSpringerandy, I used \"Villages\" because it was shorter than typing out all 3, and I don\\'t know exactly which Village we will end up exploring (probably Greenwich or West), but noted that we should just say \"Village\" if referring to the general area.\\nAynat62 - I had originally wanted to change and freshen up at our hotel before Wicked, but it\\'s slightly out of the way in comparison to what we are doing that afternoon. We could do Bryant Park earlier, or not stay as long (do we really need 2 hours if we aren\\'t going to skate?), so we have time to nip back for a bit. It\\'s only a 10 - 15 min walk back to our hotel from Bryant Park, and we could take a taxi to Wicked to save our feet. I\\'ll give some more thought to whether a different night is better - it would mean cutting short some activity on Wednesday or Friday.\\nThanks for the comments so far. Since you like walking, check out this site, so many great self guiding walking tours, mix and match, etc.:\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html Thanks for the link!\\nI think I managed to move things around so that we do Wicked on Friday instead, which starts an hour later and gives us more time to have a rest. You\\'re welcome, enjoy your trip. The Natural History Museum is very large and you should decide beforehand what you want to see. They reopened their gems and minerals recently and that is supposed to be remarkable. The dino bones and representation of a full size whale are popular items. The younger crowd may not be around at that late hour which is always a plus for that museum. When I visited NYC before in December years ago, it was around 14-18 degrees Fahrenheit. With the recent storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc., has there also been changes in average temperatures? Was last fall/winter a typical temperature of that season, or have you noticed any increase or decrease in temps? Changes in weather have been occurring for thousands of years and will continue to do so.\\nGlobal Warming is a political tool in my opinion. Layover Lounge. Really. https://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowForum-g1-i49577-The_Layover_Lounge.html I believe global is real but it does not dramatically affect day to day temps. December weather has always been variable. I am sure all who have lived a long time in the NY/New England area can remember December holidays when we were out and about without coats and those so cold that we hated to go out.\\nYou can see historical weather here to get some ideas of past weather.\\nhttps://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ny/new-york-city/KLGA/date/2020-12-5\\nExamples;\\nDec 5, 2020 temps ranged 41-48F record high 69F record low 21F\\nDec 10, 2019 temps 40-58F records: high 70F low 9F\\nDec 15, 2018 temps 46-50F records: high 67F low 15F\\nDeb 20,2017 temps 36-52F records: high 61F low: -2F\\nDec 25, 2016 temps 38-51F. records: high 64F low -1F\\nDec 31, 2015 temps 43-50F records: high 63F low 3F I speak of the commercial that has lady Liberty in the background. Such a beautiful spot that I have not heard of or is it fabricated for the commercial?? Thank you New Yorkers! Liberty View Island in the Harbor. The only way to go there is by chartering a sailboat. LOL Erich.\\nWe already have 65 posts on this topic. It’s all studio magic.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k8967565-Best_spot_to_take_pictures_with_the_Statue_of_Liberty-New_York_City_New_York.html Yes, the images are composites as there is no real land that close to the statue in that orientation. Its a fake picture, the closest land spor to the statue of Liberty is on Governors Island and that is still over a mile away. You would need a super telephoto lens to get a shot like that Libery State Park in NJ is closer than Governors Island, however the view there is from the back as opposed to the Front In a Hollywood Sound Studio. Or the modern equivalent (on a computer) ***We already have 65 posts on this topic. It’s all studio magic.***\\nYeah I remember that thread, studio magic for sure. Chroma key (AKA Green screen) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key Lol, now I feel silly\\nThank you very much for responding nevertheless. Cheers I am waiting for a commercial with the emu pecking at Miss Liberty. https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos-jasper-johns-retrospective-whitney/\\nI am not a museum person. Outside of the Brooklyn Museum, I can\\'t think of any NYC museums that I have been to. This looks like a nice exhibit.\\n(I do go to museums in other cities. Strange....I know.) Looks very cool ter. Thanks for posting. ^\\nYou are very welcome! Yes ter1413 am still waiting for you to join me at the Met! My daughter and I will be in NYC 12-29 thru 1-2. Her birthday is 12-30, she will be 28! NYE ball drop is on her bucket list! I am looking for some great suggestions for 1) Birthday Brunch, 2) Birthday Dinner? We both love to eat and have a good time! TIA! One of the best brunches is Norma’s. A favorite for brunch or dinner is Balthazar. At 28, she may like the vibe in the Meatpacking District so any of Catch, Catch Steak, STK, Tao may be fun for her. I read about a new restaurant on the Gansevoort Rooftop, worth looking into. If she’s more of an East Village/Lower East Side type, perhaps Pylos or Dirty French or Gemma.\\nYou didn’t mention budget so these may be outside your budget but 2 new rooftop restaurants that look promising (haven’t been) are Electric Lemon at Hudson Yards and Saga at 70 Pine St. If too pricey, you can go to the new rooftop bar at 70 Pine (Overstory) and then have dinner at Crown Shy on the ground floor. (Note: Overstory is only open Wed-Sat).\\nIf none of these work, please provide cuisine and budget preferences. There are thousands of restaurants to choose from. Thank you for the suggestions. I\\'m not too concerned about the budget. We like all types of food! I really just want her to have a great time for her birthday!\\nEdited: 5:36 pm, September 22, 2021 If it’s not a surprise, then show her my list and see what she thinks. Or encourage her to look at The Infatuation website. It trends a bit younger. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k6006502-Things_to_watch_out_for_on_New_Year_s_Eve-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHave your daughter read through this thread (there are more in the FAQs on the right hand side of the screen) to have her see if it\\'s more of a hassle than she thinks. I had a friend get talked into going to the Ball Drop by his partner & he said never again. Thank you! I will have her check it out! I went to the ball drop(pre 9/11) and it was a very cool experience.\\nWould I do it again? Probably not. But if it is on her bucket list, I say that she should read up on the procedures/experiences of others and go for it! You both might like a nice Afternoon Tea in between the other eating? This list might whet your appetite. (But as with anything since the pandemic , please check what\\'s still open and offered).\\nhttps://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/new-york/new-york-city/articles/top-ten-restaurants-for-afternoon-tea-in-the-city/\\nOne that\\'s not on that list but I\\'ve often looked at for myself is the Whitby Hotel\\'s afternoon tea.\\nhttps://www.firmdalehotels.com/hotels/new-york/the-whitby-hotel/afternoon-tea/\\nRooftop bars for a cocktail or two might be nice as well. Many stay open over winter with heating and enclosed areas, and it\\'s a very New York experience. Aynat62.. thank you for the suggestions! I hope you both enjoy! It sounds a like a great trip for your daughter. Hi\\nMe & my partner are visiting from the UK for New Year’s Eve this year.\\nWe’d like to book a nice restaurant for New Year’s Eve itself and then would welcome recommendations of where to go to see fireworks whilst avoiding the madness of Times Square.\\nWe’re celebrating his birthday while we’re there so happy to spend a few $$$ for the New Year’s Eve meal but nothing insane.\\nThanks so much! 3 locations for fireworks are in Central Park, Coney Island and Grand Army Plaza(also Bklyn.)\\nI will guess that you will want to be in the city...so Central Park is where you should look to be before midnight. Do know that this isn\\'t like the 4th of July fireworks....nothing is. But it is a cool way to bring in 2022.\\nNYE is a Friday night. That doesn\\'t really matter as you are on vacation. I would plan to be out of your hotel by 8. Grab some breakfast to go and then take a quick walk around Times Sq(8:30-9am) as the crowds start to arrive and the excitement starts to build.\\nThen have a plan. Do something....ride the ferry/visit Grand Central/check out Bryant Parks Winter Village, etc.\\nGrab lunch and then stop at one of the many street vendors that you will see and pick up some 2022 glasses/hats/horns. Then maybe back to the hotel for a rest....or not.\\nThen get changed and head to dinner(you will get recs for that) and then head to C Park. You don\\'t have to get there very early. But give yourself time!\\nEnjoy! Around 60 days before NYE, restaurants BEGIN to start announcing what they are doing, whether they are open, special menus, how many seatings (usually the earlier seating is less expensive). It\\'s easy to research on Opentable.com, as we get closer.\\nThe fireworks are in Central Park, so you may want a restaurant in that neighborhood (Upper East Side or Upper West Side) in order to see them. Traveling around the city on NYE isn\\'t so easy (historically). Don\\'t even try to get a cab, take the subway.\\nPersonally, when I\\'m in town for NYE, I try to stay below 14th St. Thanks so much for your help! I’ll keep an eye out next month to see what’s going on.\\nCan’t wait! Hello everyone! We have an 11 hour layover at JFK on September 25. I am looking for some advice please:\\n1. We bought tickets to the 911 Museum / Memorial for 9am. What is the easiest way to get from the airport to the museum?\\n2. We would like to have breakfast while we wait for 9am to come around. Any recommendations?\\n3. We have carryon travel backpacks. Our tickets say we can store those in the coat room, but I didn’t see anyone online that reflects that. Has anyone done it or can confirm?\\n4. Our flight leaves at 5pm (arrives at 530ish AM). What time do you recommend leaving 911 area to head back?\\nMany thanks to everyone! Actually pretty easy: Air Train to Howard Beach, A train to Fulton St. Takes about an hour or so. Maybe an hour and 20 minutes depending on connections. A short walk.\\nThere are places in Fulton Center (google Fulton Center to see what\\'s open at that time, maybe Krispy Kreme) for something quick, places in Westfield/Oculus, there\\'s a food court in Westfield, which is attached to the Oculus. A couple of fast food places on Broadway. Most decent places open at 9 (check out La Parissiene), but Starbucks at 130 Fulton St opens at 6:30. George\\'s at 89 Greenwich opens at 7am.\\nI would leave for the subway no later than 1:30ish, I would want to physically be on the subway by 1:45. (I\\'m assuming no check in luggage and that you will already have your boarding passes and go straight to the gate for a domestic flight).\\nIf you don\\'t mind a ten minute walk, since you have time to kill anyhow, go to Leo\\'s bagels. You can pick up a fresh made bagels and eat them outside right there in the adjacent little park. https://leosbagels.com/\\nEdited: 9:14 pm, September 05, 2021 Hi Risa, thank you for the recommendations! I will check them out. I also appreciate the directions.\\nOur flight will be international, JFK to Dublin, Ireland. We have TSA Precheck. Do you think same timeframe is okay? I would be on the train by 12:45-1, then. But that should be plenty of time to see the museum and the Memorial. If you go to Leo\\'s, you can also take a peek at Stone St (will be mostly closed, walk up to Broad St, walk on Broad past the Stock Exchange, take a photo with Fearless Girl, then left on Wall St, Trinity Church will be right in front of you on Broadway, across the street on Broadway, peer through the bars into the little cemetery (Alexander Hamilton is buried there, you can see his grave on Rector St side, if you want - it\\'s to your left on Broadway), or just take a right on Broadway (that\\'s heading north), and when you get to Zucotti Park, you can eat your bagel there if you want, or just cross it diagonally (that\\'s what I always do) to Trinity Place. You will see the Oculus at that point. The 9/11 Memorial/Museum is behind it. Would it be crazy to take an Uber from the museum to the airport to buy more time? No, not crazy....do you have a GPS app on your phone? Or check out Uber/Lyft for estimated time...it\\'s an hour without traffic, but if there\\'s traffic, it\\'s the same amount of time as the subway. I would look to see what the traffic situation is and make a game day decision. (Use the UBer/Lyft app just to see what the time frame is - and then take a yellow cab you hail on the street, which will be cheaper, it\\'s $70 at that time, including tip, Uber/Lyft will be more expensive). If you do decide you want to do public transit I believe you could also do it by taking the Air Train from the airport to Jamaica station, where you could get the E subway line and take it all the way to what I believe is the last stop, at the WTC. I know this because I was once down there with a visitor who wanted to go to the WTC site, and it was raining heavily and on the return we just went into that subway station and got an uptown train. However, I have no idea how this compares to other suggestions time wise for airport trips. The A train is faster than the E for going downtown. Thank you for the feedback. I have seen suggestions for A train and E train and wasn’t sure either. ^^^ Generally about 10 minutes faster.\\nJust make sure you get on one that is going to HOWARD BEACH, not Lefferts Blvd. Okay, is that an easy mix up to make I take it?\\nI was reading you can buy one Metro card for two people and just put a flat amount on it and share it?

We really enjoyed the KGB Espionage Museum on W14 st We enjoyed the Leslie-Lohman museum on Wooster Street near Canal Street. An unexpected treat! I was blown away by the Museum of the Moving Image many moons ago and watching the Checkers speech for the first time. Now, I just go to YouTube to pul up old clips. Is it still worth going? Anything that I cannot find on YouTube?\\nEdited: 2:25 pm, September 23, 2021 The fire museum is very old school and well worth combining with the Ear Inn right down the street which is sort of a museum itself. One museum that almost never shows up on these lists is the New Museum on Bowery, Always changing, always weird, and close to all sorts of cool lower Manhattan things.\\nEdited: 2:40 pm, September 23, 2021 the transit museum in Brooklyn is Cool, they have old Subway cars there I only checked the first link - it doesn\\'t mention the Museum of Sex.\\nAlso. I always forget to mention this: there are a couple of turn of the last century ships moored just below Pier 17 which are open to the public for touring. I think the website is southstreetmuseum.org\\nAnd last night, I happened to walk by the Theordore Roosevelt Museum on East 20th, just west of the Rotisserie restaurant.\\nEdited: 3:53 pm, September 23, 2021 Brooklyn Museum is also really good, Its comparable to the Met, its downside is that its in Brooklyn not manhattan The Tenement Museum sounded good. We’re looking to go next week. We went to the Tenement Museum in February of last year, right before Covid. Loved it Good evening.\\nWhat\\'s your favorite breakfast place near the South Street Seaport? Using Google Maps I\\'m only finding Blue Spoon Coffee Company. Any other spots you can recommend? We\\'re not looking for fancy - just an iced coffee and a breakfast sandwich.\\nThank you. I haven\\'t been to these but they\\'re in the area, look them up: Flavors Cafe and Cafe Patoro. Also a couple of Starbucks and Gregory\\'s Coffee. brekkie? What language is that? There’s Squire’s Diner a few blocks south of the seaport. https://squiresdiner.com/ Its a diner - not anything unique. There’s also Pearl Diner which is over 50 years old and kind of cool looking. Also south of the Seaport in the financial district. https://www.pearldinerny.com/uploads/detail/pdf_catering/59/Catering_Menu_Pearl_Diner.pdf\\nOn Pier 17, across the Seaport, there’s an interesting coffee place. I don’t remember the name. Near Ssam Bar and Carne Mare. And Cafe Patoro on Front Street in the Seaport Area which serves La Colombe coffee. Squire’s Diner off of Fulton is in that area. On my last trip in November ‘19, I was staying at the Millinneum Hilton and ate there three mornings. Old school with mostly police officers and other locals in the morning. Howland - Brits use Brekkie and I think Aussies do too Just a week or so ago I was thinking to myself it had been years since anyone on this forum had asked for brekkie recommendations. I thought maybe Brits had stopped using the word. Not stopped using the word just not been allowed to travel Good morning and thank you all for the for the breakfast spot recommendations in the South Street Seaport area.\\nI\\'m an American who picked up the term \"brekkie\" on our first trip to London about 10 years ago, and use the term to annoy my husband greatly. :)\\nHave a nice day, all! Leo\\'s Bagels at Hannover Square (maybe a 10 minute walk from South Street Seaport) - their bagels are the best in the neighborhood and they have a bunch of sandwiches and other pastries, coffee, etc. Only downside is that there isn\\'t really space to sit inside (especially right now, but if the weather\\'s decent, there\\'s plenty of places to sit outside nearby. Hole in the Wall Hi ,\\nI will be flying to JFK via Cathay pacific from Hong Kong arriving at 10:00pm . I then have a flight from JFK via Delta at 8am the next day. So it\\'s about a 10 hour waiting time.\\nI know we have to check out and grab our baggage after landing and I have to recheck my bags.\\nso my questions are\\n1) After claiming my bags , do I have to head out of my arrival terminal and go to the terminal where Delta is? (How would I know what Terminal I need to go to?)\\n2) Since I arrive 10pm ish , how can I check my bags in for the 8am flight with Delta? Would the counter be open for that ?\\n3) If I can\\'t check in my bags and get my boarding pass, I can\\'t exactly go into departures right? So I\\'m stuck landside until the check in counters open\\nAny advice would be helpful! I am someone who needs to plan everything very meticulously and need to know the whole process.\\nIf someone could explain how it works upon arriving and then flying out again , that would be super appreciated! Thank you 1) tons of signage and you can easily look up your terminal and gate online\\n2) unlikely they will take them that early\\n3) you can get your boarding pass and check in online 24 hours before the flight time like you will probably do for your initial flight. But you will likely be stuck with your bags until you can check them\\nHow about a short stay at the JFK hotel?\\nEdited: 6:19 am, September 24, 2021 Hello. I’m planning my trip to NYC from 13th of November to 29th of November. I’m trying to decide between few hotels but I’m having a hard time so I could really use some advice on that. What I want from my room is a really nice view of Manhattan, a little bit more of space since I’m gonna be traveling with two big suitcases and there’s gonna be two of us, I want the hotel to be overall nice and clean space with a good location. The hotels that I’m trying to decide between are:\\n- YOTEL New York Times Square\\n- M Social Hotel Times Square\\n- Pestana Park Avenue\\n- The New Yorker a Wyndham Hotel\\nI will really appreciate your help :) A really nice view can be a lot of things. To some people it\\'s a view from a high floor where you can see a lot and includes landmarks like Central Park or the Empire State Building or one of the rivers. To others it may be just a view that isn\\'t blocked by a wall next door and looks out on a more or less typical cityscape of buildings, streets, traffic, etc.\\nI am not familiar with any of those hotels so hopefully someone else can answer that question. In the meantime I suggest you do some more research -- some hotel websites now give square footage of different class rooms. Also by entering its address on google street view you ought to be able to get a good look at the hotel building and its neighbors, noting taller neighboring buildings that might block light and views. If you aren\\'t sure which aspect (north, south, etc.) a side of the hotel has, come back here and someone will identify it for you. The New Yorker Hotel offers lots of rooms with fine views. Since it sits on the corner of 34th Street & Eighth Avenue, any corner rooms facing east and south offer stunning views. It\\'s a 40 story hotel, so the higher up your room, the finer the view. Easily visible is the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River. These rooms are sunny, too.\\nCall the hotel directly and ask for Neida in Reservations since agents at the 800 number don\\'t know the hotel room layout and will put you anywhere in the building.\\nThe New Yorker is an older hotel and has rooms of all sizes. A suite at the New Yorker costs as much as a single room elsewhere. It has a 24 hour restaurant in the building and 3 subway lines stop at the station underneath the hotel. Foreign visitors are more than welcome by everyone there. M Social has decent sized rooms and some views in an excellent location. The hotel was recently updated.\\nPestana is new but the rooms with views look relatively expensive. The location is quieter than the others but good.\\nNot a fan of Yotel for location or size of rooms but many like the cool vibe.\\nThe New Yorker is an old hotel and the location while convenient is not very attractive.\\nGo back and check prices for the room you want. I know M Social discounts if you join the MIllenium frequent guest program (for free online.) Hi,\\nMy husband and I just got back from NYC, we stayed 3 nights in at the Hyatt Place LIC. It was his first trip and I\\'ve been a good handful of times now. We flew Delta into LGA, the seats were pretty comfy, and live TV with sports which made my husband happy as he got to watch college football, just remember to bring wired headphones! I wasn\\'t even expecting TVs, as our last flight with American, we had a phone rest in the space of the TV!!\\nWe took the bus/subway combo to LIC, we brought the 7 day metrocard and broke even on it. It would be great if you could put your metrocard on your smartphone/watch, it looks as if they are working on it with OMNY.\\nHyatt Place LIC is a short walk from 3 subway stations, Queensboro, Queens Plaza and Court St. Hotel was nice, comfy beds, wifi, all that good stuff, they have complimentary breakfast which we never used, and parking.\\nThis is going to be more of an observation TR than play by play.\\n============\\nWe ended up eating a lot of pizza in our short time in the city, we didn\\'t plan it that way, just ended up happening. Our first NY slice was at Joe\\'s in Midtown, very good! My husband loved it and said it was the best. We then had Bleecker St Pizza two days later, good but they didn\\'t heat it through all the way and their bases are thicker so it was luke warm, a little disappointing TBH. On our last day we ended up eating a Juliana\\'s in Brooklyn and it was delicious, named best pizza ever by my husband!!\\nPublic Parks, Bryant Park, Madison Sq Park, Washington Sq Park or WSP as I hear a local refer to it as, any pocket of green space, NYers love, everyone is just relaxing - I love it, but my question is where does everyone go when nature calls?! We had such a problem this trip trying to find a restroom when we needed one. Businesses unless a sit down restaurant don\\'t let the public use their facilities, public restrooms just are nasty (unfortunately). I imagine there\\'s an app! Explains why a lot of the city smells like urine, sadly.\\nGrand Central Station was the quietest I\\'ve ever seen it! The dining concourse was a little sad, so many eateries closed, and no more Juniors.\\nWe hit up Shake Shack in MSP, what happened to the B line, just to grab a beer at etc... Thankfully the regular/only line wasn\\'t too long. Tried to order online but didn\\'t look like they let you order beer online.\\n==================\\nWe had fun on evenings exploring LIC, hitting up local breweries and bars. The Beast Next Door was right around the corner from our hotel, we saw it in the afternoon and it was all closed up, and you wouldn\\'t expect the transformation on an evening, we had a very good old fashioned there. Such a shame it was closed Mondays, but we ended up a Luzzo\\'s a few early evenings for a couple beers, just drinking outside on the sidewalk/patios was soo nice, and the weather was lovely while we were in town, a nice break from the Texas heat, apart from the subway which is still muggy.\\nWe had a great time at Fifth Hammer one evening, a view of the Chrysler Building, and an open jazz jam session going on, with craft beer - what more can you ask for. I love that they had the LIC brewery walking tour, we hit a few but not all!\\nThe NY Ferries were new for me, we ended up riding the St George route, great views and basically a whole boat to ourselves. The Brooklyn Ikea route was very busy. We tried on Tuesday to ride to DUMBO from Hunters Point but turned out the UN General Assembly was in town, and basically stopped any activity on the river, and we didn\\'t get to ride again unfortunately. The views from this side of town are great though, and in my opinion better than from Brooklyn, the ferry landing there has blocked the views now.\\nWe queued for Katz, over ordered but my husband loved his rueben!! The line wasn\\'t too bad TBH, my husband already wants to go back.\\nChecked out Little Island, we both agreed we enjoyed the High Line more.\\n=============\\nWe didn\\'t have too many bacon, egg and cheeses - only one from Liberty Bagels in Midtown, they were very stingy on the bacon. We did try a couple Chopped Cheeses, which were pretty enjoyable TBH, one from the \"original\" in Harlem, at Blue Sky Deli and another from the local market around the corner from our hotel, my husband actually liked the local one better.\\nWe hit up Yankee Stadium which was actually the reason for the trip. We saw the Rangers play the Yankees. Yankees are very proud fans, we were a little concerned we might catch some negativity but no one said anything negative to us, a little bit of banter, but nothing compared to when we saw Rangers V Astros in Houston!!! We were in a lower section, and there was one stage, when a Rangers fan above us on the next level, starting cheering for the Rangers, and a Yankee fan didn\\'t like it, and food and containers got thrown and were falling down in front of us!! But no hassle for us, no problems on the subway ride home. We hit up the Bronx drafthouse prior to the game, and the staff were soo nice and friendly, probably the friendliest staff we\\'d encountered all trip.\\nHit up Levain Bakery, their cookies are still great, what happened to the original location, we ended up at the one a couple blocks up. The fresh ones have nothing on those new frozen ones they have starting selling across the country. Central Park was pretty quite too, we did see three sets on brides/grooms taking photos at NY Public Library.\\nThe subway was still just a busy as its always been, crowded cars etc.. We got asked for our vaccine cards pretty much for all indoor places, so be prepared. Allow yourself time to get places, I noticed or it felt like it took longer to get across town, than up or down.\\nWe had a great trip, walked a lot, my husband enjoyed his first trip to the city, now he wants to come back and see the Rangers play the Mets! Their scheduled for July, next year dunno if I want to come back to NYC in July though, too hot! Seems like you packed a bunch in, thanks for sharing! Thanks for reporting back, and good to hear you had a nice trip. Great trip report!! I totally want to try a chopped cheese as they look delicious. The BEC also sounds so good, but I don’t eat pork. **where does everyone go when nature calls?**\\nGatorade bottles!\\nI joke.\\nI usually just stop into a bar or somewhere like that. If I have to buy a quick beer, I have no problem with that.\\nDuring this past summer, I have used the restrooms in Grand Central, Bryant Bark, various bars and establishments around the city. Never had a problem. In the NYC tour guide exam, the answer to where to find bathrooms is surprisingly hotels. Some hotels could be problematic, but many will do. Starbucks, other cafes, bars, fast food joints, mall areas (Hudson Yards, Pier 17 etc), large stores like Barnes and Noble. Some public bathrooms arent bad. Such a great report! Thanks. Always love reading a visitor’s view of my home! nice trip. Thanks for your trip report. Thanks for posting… we are going for three days in late October. The last trip I took to NYC I drove from Virginia and parked in Hoboken.... to the boat over to Manhattan and really enjoyed the experience.... but I was staying on the UWS..... this next visit we are staying in Tribeca.... does it makes sense to park in Jersey City and take the boat? Is the parking as convenient as it was in Hoboken? thanks for any information to help us out.... We just drive to TriBeCa and park in a garage there. When we go to NYC we want to spend all our time doing and seeing things, not on a ferry.\\nBut you can take that same ferry and hop the subway to your lodging, if you prefer Yeah, just park in the area of your hotel. Jersey City can be worse than Manhattan for traffic, then add in the commute, etc. There are ferries from JC that go to the financial district which is not far from Tribeca. In fact it\\'s closer than when you took the ferry to midtown and then had to travel to the UWS. How did you go? I don”t know what the parking is like in JC vs Hoboken. when I parked i Hoboken the daily rate was considerably cheaper than anything I found in NYC.... that was one of the reasons we did it.... we took a taxi from the boat arrival to our hotel.... we had three people on that trip and needed to transport luggage as well..... we did enjoy seeing the city as we arrived on a beautiful afternoon..... NY Waterway runs ferries from Hoboken to the financial district. If you were happy with the experience you had parking in Hoboken, check the schedule and see if it\\'ll work.\\nhttps://www.nywaterway.com/FerryRoutesSchedules.aspx\\nScroll down: TO MANHATTAN BROOKFIELD PLACE / BATTERY PARK CITY Spothero.com\\nBestparking.com\\nare sites to check parking prices in Manhattan. We want to take in a Broadway musical during an early October visit, and are wondering if people will be so eager to return to the theatres that discount tickets will be few. Should we take the chance? Or should we pony up and buy tickets online now? We are fairly flexible about what to see. Thank you in advance. If there is a show you want to see you better buy tickets in advance. Nobody can tell you what will happen but not every show is opening up by early october. Tickets may be somewhat limited since it is just starting to open up. Even pre-pandemic, I stopped using TKTS & buy my tickets online from the listings on Playbill & TheaterMania. Although same will argue that you can sometimes get house seats that are released by the various producers at the last minute at TKTS. I find that standing on line is not as convenient or easy as buying online. Not only do you not have to spend vacation time waiting for tickets at the TKTS booth, you can get tickets as much as a month ahead of time which could mean a better seat selection. Also, when you buy online you order your ticket off the seating chart as opposed to best available which is the usual practice at TKTS. Most shows even Hamilton have seats avaiable, There arent any international tourists , so the shows need to rely more on locals and domestic tourists who dont tend to spend as much as International tourists I don\\'t think people are going to be picking up discount tickets to hamilton via TKTS. They have like a handful of seats left for some shows usually obstructed views and then a bunch of tickets have been bought up to be resold at a markup. I don\\'t think there is any reason to buy tickets in advance, unless maybe for something like Hamilton. If it turns out what you want to see isn\\'t at TKTS there will likely be tix at the box office. Not only are international tourists not here, but many locals are still wary of crowded places, strangers, etc. Good to know. We are planning a short 3 day trip first week of November and will likely take in whatever show I can find tickets for. \"...will likely take in whatever show I can find tickets for.\"...\\nThat brings back memories. Way back in October 1973, I saw a terrible show featuring Alec Guinness. It was so bad that the actor felt obligated to do a soft-shoe dance at the end. That caused the audience to stand up and cheer. That\\'s the main thing I remember.\\n--Steve Or do what blume suggested, above. Get your discount tix AND avoid the lines and worry about getting \"shut out\" or seeing something not on your list of top choices. Just my advice, if you can get any show , Get Hamilton, this would be your chance to see it at face value.\\nNot only are locals weary of crowded spaces, I think alot of tourism is as well, cities are not high on the list, people want outdoor spaces where they can socially distance better and not have to wear a mask (Broadway enforces mask wearing and vaccinations) We saw Hamilton a few years back in Chicago but we had horribly obstructed view seats which prevented us from seeing a lot of the show…and we paid way over face value for them…!!! I’ll do some checking…we love live theater so at this point in time, anything live on stage will be a welcome treat! I am visiting NYC for the 4th time on Monday 15th November for 5 nights. I am thinking of doing something a bit different this time like hiring a car for the final day or two and seeing outside of the city! The plan is roughly to have Monday evening (after landing) to Thursday lunchtime in the city. After that, I\\'m thinking of hiring a car and going somewhere for Thursday afternoon and Friday. I\\'d like to drop the car back at JFK and stay in an airport hotel on Friday evening, before flying out at 8am Saturday morning.\\nMissing the cost of a taxi from Manhattan to JFK early on Saturday morning would hopefully help to offset some of the car hire cost.\\nI\\'m thinking Long Island or something like High Point state park, but am very open to suggestions.\\nAny tips appreciated!\\nThanks Take a look at Enterprise car rental, they have many depot locations and they also pick you up from a nearby train station if you need it (handy when you\\'re staying in Manhattan but travelling out), to do the paperwork and collect the car.\\nThe Hudson Valley is a popular area for overnighters and short breaks.\\nhttps://travelhudsonvalley.com/\\nStaying at JFK, maybe the TWA hotel would suit you. That\\'s right at Terminal 5 and is a retro style hotel with lots of amenities (pool in summer, ice skating in winter, a retro TWA museum, bar in an old plane etc). If you\\'re leaving from another terminal you can take the Airtrain which is free.\\nhttps://www.twahotel.com/\\nSomeone else asked a similar question to you a few weeks ago and you might like to read the thread for ideas: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28953-i4-k13664963-Hudson_valley_solo_trip-New_York.html How insane is Manhattan on Black Friday? I’m back for the first time in 2 years over Thanksgiving week!! So excited\\nThanks Unless you are out shopping, it will seem like a normal/crowded weekend(even thought we are talking about a Friday) in NYC.\\nNothing to worry about if you are away from the main shopping areas. LOL. In the context of NYC, I thought Black Friday was October 19th… and by insane, I thought the OP was talking about Wall Street bankers panicking on the streets\\nEdited: 11:43 am, September 23, 2021 That made me laugh. Needed that today. Thank you 🤣 Except Oct 19 1987 and Oct 28, 1929 were both Mondays. So I got the day wrong. But I still have visions on insanity on Wall Street. I have actually been shopping on Black Friday. I am not talking 4am shopping or waiting in lines. I am talking 1pm...some small electronics and some clothing. This wasn\\'t for Xmas gifts. This was stuff for me that I could get on sale.\\nI didn\\'t think it was a big deal. And this was in major shopping areas. Crowds may be less this year, at least insofar as people doing Christmas shopping. The message I am hearing in the media is that due to worldwide supply issues, people will not be able to count on finding certain things closer to Christmas, much less on sale, so they are suggesting people buy now, even if not on sale, if there is something they know they want or need. I used to shop Black Friday (near Boston, not NYC), but not this year. my gift giving list has been pared down (by mutual agreement)\\nI am still leery of big crowds due to the incidents of \"break through COVID\". I wonder if others feel the same.\\nEdited: 1:52 pm, September 23, 2021 i do not think that they celebrate the various Wall Street crashes. At least not to the point that it will intrude on your visit. I´m looking into a week long trip at the end of April 2022 (If the US will let vaccinated international tourists in) We are a couple in our 30´s and 40´s, we will be doing a lot of touristy stuff but also going out to dinner/nightlife.\\nI had thought to book the Excelsior in the Upper West Side but google says it´s closed so now I have to start from scratch.\\nOur budget is in the 250-300$ per night range, if you guys have any suggestions for nice/fun hotels in that price range that would be a huge help.\\nWe´ll be using the Subway quite a lot, so I would like the hotel to be close to a subway station, but otherwise I´m open to locations.\\nMaybe a hotel in Brooklyn would be a better value for my money for that budget? I´m open to that as well. Exact dates help. One bed will do? Queen size ok? Any location ok or do you prefer UWS or Brooklyn?\\nNot sure why you picked Excelsior, can you explain so maybe we can find something similar? I´m thinking of April 20-27, 2022.\\nOne bed, queen size is fine but King size is preferable.\\nI had heard that the Excelsior had a great location close to Central Park but not that expensive.\\nWe´ll be all over the place so I´m not set on a specific location, just close to a subway station. No need to apologize for looking for help! That’s why we hang out here. 😊\\n“Nice/fun” doesn’t seem to fit the Excelsior, but it was close to Central Park. I have a list of places within budget that you can investigate. The first list is nowhere close to Central Park, but are more in the nice/fun category. They are in lots of different area. I avoided the Upper East Side, Times Square, and Hell’s Kitchen. Here goes:\\nCitizen M -New York Bowery\\nArtezen Hotel\\nNobleDEN\\nWalker Hotel - Tribeca\\nFreehand New York\\nThe Marlton\\nThe Frederick Hotel\\nAll have free cancelable terms, really important right now due to the uncertainty and it being a bit of time in advance.\\nIf it is important to you to be close to Central Park though, none of those will fit the bill. Take a look at the Beacon Hotel and Radio City Apartments, though both come in slightly over budget. Also, I don’t think Radio City Apartments meets the nice/fun criteria in terms of hotel or area.\\nSee what you think and if you have more questions, let us know what you like/don’t like about some of these options. Thanks so much, a lot of good option on that list :) McWhippet has given you a good list of hotels in fun areas. Just realize that many of those hotels have very small rooms. I also think for a 1 week stay, you would want at least a fridge. Btw, it was announced yesterday the travel ban will be lifted. ☺️ Ok so not all hotel rooms are that tiny? Thats good to know :P\\nSince we are staying for a week, hotels recommendations with a liiiiitle more room and a mini fridge would be appreciated as well :) It’s nothing special so probably doesn’t meet your nice/fun criteria…but the Hampton Inn Times Square North has rooms that are a bit larger than some others. Can’t remember if we had a mini fridge, I think we did. The location isn’t right near Central Park but it’s an easy walk and also close to a subway station The Artezen on the above list has decent sized rooms and is newish and very well liked on the forum. But it,s innthe financial district which is not a hotbed of nightlife but not that far from Tribeca and Soho. The Frederick in Tribeca and maybe the Roxy also in Tribeca are worth checking. Thanks all! I have a great please to start now :) booking.com on the American site shows the square footage of hotel rooms. Not always, but usually they do.\\nMany hotels have different sized rooms. It is dependent on dates whether all the sizes are available.\\nIt could be helpful to check this site.\\nIn fact I never book a hotel room in NYC without first looking at booking.com for the room size information.\\nLooking at various dates helps to identify the various sizes of the rooms of any given hotel. Voted the best in the world! Any place to get a cup? I’ve never had it. I googled Panamanian Geisha Coffee and a few places sell it. https://www.thedailymeal.com/news/drink/new-york-city-sells-america-s-most-expensive-cup-coffee/021017\\nAlso, KC Gourmet Empanadas appears to have it. On Ave B.\\nIf you have access to Google, try looking that way.\\nEdited: 12:39 pm, September 18, 2021 The beans came originally from Ethiopia. Now grown in the mountains of Western Panama! Yes. I read all about it when I googled. Very interesting https://vinepair.com/articles/panama-geisha-coffee-winner/ Am just curious where the Geisha enters the equation. No, I haven\\'t bothered to check with my \"friend\" Google. 😊 I am not sure where the label comes from. It\\'s a classfication or varietal of a type of coffee...like \"merlot \"or \"pinot noir\" for wine. The word \"gesha\" is also used. A cup of geisha coffee is $18. For me, that’s a lot of money for a cup of coffee. Before I even considered paying that amount, I would want to know why. I read a few of the articles about it. I’m intrigued of course, and may try it one day. But also mystified why anyone would just look for it and be willing to pay that amount without knowing something - the most basic things - first. I feel the same way about wine. I’ve certainly had plenty of insanely priced wine. And knowing what goes into it enhances the appreciation of it. https://www.newsroompanama.com/Coffee/panama-geisha-coffees-score-near-perfect-with-international-judges\\nIt got high marks! Even by the standards of coffee BS, that\\'s really weak. Not sure what you mean. At home I drink only Duran coffee I bring from Panama. A kilo 2.2 lbs is about $21. To me it is amazing. I will be in the city this weekend and would like to go on a movie tour or better yet watch something actually shooting. I live on the east coast so I have visited a lot of the classic nyc locations like Bethesda Fountains, Ghostbusters HQ, Rockefeller but looking for something off the beaten path. I am not sure if productions shoot on the weekends. Might be worth checking out https://onlocationvacations.com/category/daily-filming-locations/ to find out what is filming.\\nNot sure you\\'ll see much \"action\" though. I was staying in a hotel and an Episode of Blue Bloods was being filmed. I saw the car parked opposite, and as I wandered out of the hotel, I walked past and said hello to Donnie Wahlberg, but other than that, saw nothing.\\nM Thank you for sharing the link. 👏👏 I suppose I should check that link daily. I was watching the finale of Younger and saw that it was filmed in my immediate neighborhood. I love that show and somehow missed the filming. Or maybe I saw it and walked by without paying attention. They film around Walk St a LOT.\\nI saw them filming in Bryant Park a few weeks ago - some movie about the Times investigation of #metoo. Everyone was watching….I just cut through to dinner at Koi.\\nGood luck. Hi,\\nI’ve had a family holiday to New York postponed 3 times due to coronavirus so am continuing to try to get it sorted. Due to my kids now falling into important school years I now have school exams to contend with, so am considering the last week of august as a potential time to visit....but literally everyone tells me it’ll be too hot and humid then.\\nIs it really that bad? I’ll have a 15, 13 and 11 year old with me, who as you may imagine, can easily zap all the fun out of a day if they are too hot!\\nMany thanks New York weather can be somewhat variable in later August. There\\'s a chance it will be reasonably mild, but typically it will be around 28-30 centigrade during the day, with high humidity at that time of year. People who live here are accustomed to it, but we\\'re also usually not trying to fit in a ton of sightseeing during the hottest hours of summer days. That said, it can be a very good time to visit, provided you do outside things in the cooler morning or evening hours, and do indoor activities during the hotter hours of the day. In the summer time, taking things at a leisurely pace usually makes a better trip than trying to over-exert yourself. Is it really that bad?\\nIt will be hot and Fun can be had. Start early in the morning for the most strenuous activities when its cooler. Wear loose fitting all cotton clothing , hats and walk slowly and on the shady side of the street.\\nWhen the day really heats up stay out of crowded areas & avoid activities with crowds Go at a slower pace.\\nBe content with doing less during the heat of the day and enjoying indoor activities.\\nSubway platforms can become very very hot instead try taking the bus or take cabs .\\nIf this is when you want to come, or it’s the only time you can come. I would not wonder will it be really bad ? Instead, how can I make it work? No one can predict the weather and it\\'s not always hot and humid in late August. It\\'s still summer and it will likely still be hot, but we have days where humidity is low or moderate, then days where it is high. Sometimes its high for days on end, sometimes its intermittent.\\nIf you know heat will zap your kids energy, then maybe August isn\\'t right.\\nWhat are your plans? Don\\'t forget that air conditioning is refreshing and if you have a mix of indoor and outdoor attractions, that might break it up a bit. The air conditioning indoors can be fiercely cold sometimes, so that balances out the heat ;-) Combine an outdoor activity with an indoor one each day and you\\'ll be fine.\\nMaybe look into hotels with pools, the kids could cool off at the end of the day if it\\'s too hot. But, hotels with pools can be expensive, it really depends on what you are willing to pay.\\nHere\\'s a list (I can recommend the William Vale in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It\\'s not too far into Manhattan).\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/hotels/best-nyc-hotels-with-pools\\nAnd a TA list: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g60763-zfa3-New_York_City_New_York-Hotels.html New Mexico is hot, you\\'ll be OK. It will probably be more humid that you deal with but I think you will be fine. ^^The Op is not from New Mexico.\\nThey have United Kingdom as their locale.\\nEdited: 7:32 pm, September 21, 2021 It\\'s hot, and most of us complain about it endlessly, but it\\'s not actually that bad. Generally perfectly tolerable for being out and about, and usually better than earlier in the summer. If heat and humidity will ruin a vacation for you, do not come in August. Weather varies. I find it tends to be hot and humid more often than not during that time of year. Is it ideal? no. Is it a reason not to vacation during that time if that is your only option? Absolutely not. I\\'ve been in many far hotter places in august from jungles to the desert, In terms of heat NY is just uncomfortable but it has nothing on some other parts of the world. **Is it a reason not to vacation during that time if that is your only option? Absolutely not.**\\nAbsolutely agree with ^.\\nIf late August is your only option, come and enjoy. Just take things slow and you will be fine.\\nThere have been no reports of children wilting away in the heat lately. The kids will be fine. I\\'m (hopefully!!) in NYC for Thanksgiving and want to book something for Thanksgiving ASAP as I can imagine it\\'s the kind of thing that books out quite quickly.\\nIt will be just me and my husband, we\\'re staying in midtown but comfortable on the subway so not tied to that area.\\nNever had a traditional Thanksgiving meal so open to that or something a bit different. Open to different budgets.\\nThank you everyone in advance. Really excited to be back in NYC after 2 years away! Take a look at Opentable. They get a list of restaurants offering Thanksgiving meals including their menus, but it\\'s too early yet. Keep an eye on it, and you can also book using Opentable as well.\\nMake sure you decide quickly because reservations fill up fast. Have something decided by the end of October and ready to reserve.\\nhttps://www.opentable.com.au/open/new-york\\nAnd you might find this Thanksgiving guide helpful on choosing where to eat and what to do. It was written in 2019, so check things before deciding on anything.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12943017-Thanksgiving_2019_in_NYC_What_to_Do_Where_to_Eat-New_York_City_New_York.html Thanks Aynat!\\nWe use Openpages/Resy/other similar sites a lot when in NYC\\nI didn’t see the guide as I’m currently posting from my phone so thank you for that! I have a weekend trip planned to see some friends at Cornel while I’m visiting the city. What would be the best place to pick up the rental car? This will be for Friday - Sunday.\\nI haven’t driven in the city before and was thinking to go to Newark airport to pick it up and drop off there but I’m wondering if there is something nearby and maybe cheaper compared to the airport.\\nThanks! You know you can fly into Ithaca, don\\'t you? I am confused because your home is listed as Seattle but it sounds like you\\'re going from NYC to Ithaca. There are direct flights from Newark I believe on Delta. The Ithaca airport designation is ITH. IIRC you\\'ll be at an UWS hotel?\\nIf yes, comparison price a neighborhood pick up at a location near the West Side highway (and an EWR return if flying home after Ithaca) The time & expense of going to EWR for pick up may not be worth it.\\nIF this is in the middle of your visit & you\\'ll be returning to Manhattan look at https://aamcar.com/ They are a small local agency. We\\'ve rented various vehicles from them for college runs. Fleet not as new as the national chains - but clean & well maintained Their 96th St location is right by the highway\\nEdited: 12:29 pm, September 22, 2021 There are a number of car rental places in Jersey City. Some of Jersey City is linked to Manhattan by a train system like the subway called PATH so the fare is only $2.75. Compare rates between renting from Jersey City (but see where the locations are vis a vis a PATH station) vs the airport. It,s a 4-5 hr. drive to Cornell. There are inexpensive buses that go to Cornell if you don\\'t really need a car once there. I agree to comparison price a car rental agency near where your hotel is located in New York City. Especially if you’re returning back to your New York City hotel after Ithaca.\\nThat’s what I would do unless my hotel was in Midtown.\\nIn that case I would find a rental agency in the upper West side as Kaye suggested.\\nI’ve driven in/out of NYC from Boston, Pennsylvania and DC.\\nWhen I came into the city from Boston I drove to my hotel dropped my bags then I went to the car rental return ,which was nearby on the upper West side. The traffic up there is much less hectic.\\nGoing to New Jersey to return the car seems like an unecessary trip especially if you’re coming back into Manhattan to a hotel. I’ve done rental car drop-offs and pick-ups at neighborhood locations in Manhattan a few times. I’ve purposely avoided rush hours and generally used locations on the west side (I was also coming from or going to upstate NY). I understand your concern with driving in the city, but it was not bad at all for me in those circumstances. I understand your concern as well with city driving and I should’ve said so in my first post .I was very apprehensive about doing it the first time too , in my case dropping the rental , I wanted to get all the way to my hotel with my bags.\\nWhen picking up a rental I wanted the ease of it being near the hotel that I was checking out of.\\nI steeled myself and I found I could handle it.\\nIf you have driven in Seattle area ,you know about heavy traffic. Seattle is my hometown so I know about it too.\\nYou need to do what feels comfortable.\\nSide-note: When I drove my own car with New Mexico plates I got honked at in Manhattan,\\nnot so when I drove rental cars with New York , Mass. and New Jersey plates. Hi all- yes I know I can fly but I don’t want to. I would rather drive. It gives me a chance to explore the area and maybe some cool fall colors while I’m there.\\nIt is during my trip to NYC for the weekend. I plan to come back to the city after, hence felt driving back and forth to the airport maybe a waste.\\nI’ll look into what you all have recommended and some place on the UWS.\\nMy only worry is getting stuck in the traffic out there and dealing with some aggressive drivers on the road lol My son did the same trip during the 4th of July weekend - and rented his car from Turo -- www.turo.com. He picked up and dropped off the car at Newark Penn Stn. He was otherwise based in Manhattan during this stay.\\nTuro - in case you are not aware - is sort of like an AirBnB for cars - people renting their cars.... maybe worth checking this out as an option..... he did say that he saved a \\'\\'lot of money\\'\\' by renting thru Turo. He just took the PATH trains to and from Newark Penn Stn from WTC. I\\'m driving from Queens,NY to Tuxedo Park,NY to the Renaissance Faire. Why do the directions take me through NJ then back into NY? Is there no way to take I-87 all the way and cut over? Is this really the best route? Queens is pretty big. Where exactly are you starting? You can take 287 and 87, but that might not be fastest depending where you are starting and time of day and day of week Whose directions are you looking at?\\nhttps://renfair.com/ny/directions-weather/\\nThere are a variety of route options from Queens where you can drive through the Bronx and then cross the Hudson River farther north (Cuomo/Tappan Zee bridge I-287) You can take The tribough Bridge from Queens and that goes to i-87 in the Bronx (The Major Deegan)\\nHowever going through NJ is shorter and faster as I Route 17 goes diagnal from Paramus (Near GW Bridge) to Suffern (I-87)..but you stay on 17 to go t Tuxedo. You also avoid the tolls on the NY Thruway Look on a map and it\\'ll make more sense.\\nIf you take the Tapan Zee Bridge, you\\'ll be in NY the entire time.\\nAs Howard mentioned, the shorter route is If you go over the GWB and take NJ Route 17, which essentially turns into the NY State Thruway at the NJ/NY border.\\nTo get to NJ Route 17, Route 4 is the shortest route, but you can also take Route 80 to Route 17 as well. Thank you, I was thinking I would have more tolls going through NJ. Thanks, I\\'ll see how much time I\\'ll be saving. Thanks I just clicked on maps on my phone.. I will pick a route that\\'s quick. I\\'m not in a rush and I\\'ll be leaving Queens early There is a toll on I-87 (NY Thruway) in Scarsdale I think, Its between the Bronx Border and I-287 near Tarrytown My husband and I are doing a 3-night getaway with our 10yr old twin girls in November. I want to be near Central Park/Midtown for the hotel but not in Times Square. I\\'m looking for something fun, trendy, or historic. Would love something with a bar or restaurant on-site that\\'s actually open. Our budget is >$400/night. Where should I check out? What are your exact dates and how many beds do you need (would the girls share?). Things like this can have a big impact on price Do you really mean \"more than\" $400.00/night or do you mean less than $400.00? If your budget is more than $400.00/night then you can choose anything really.\\nYou might take a look at the Moxy Times Square hotel. It\\'s not right in Times Square (a little south of Bryant Park) and is modern and a bit quirky and has a rooftop bar.\\nhttp://moxytimessquare.com/\\nThe Residence Inn Cental Park is just south of Central Park and is the highest hotel in North America. The lobby and breakfast room is a bit quirky.\\nhttps://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycpr-residence-inn-new-york-manhattan-central-park/ Yes, sorry- under $400 per night. Moxy was one I had my eye on but wasn’t sure of the location. This is the fun, different vibe I’m looking for.\\nEdited: 7:06 pm, September 22, 2021 It\\'s not a bad location, I\\'d be happy to stay there. Check if the room sizes will be big enough for you all though.\\nYou could walk to the ESB from there. Times Square itself is a 5-10 minute walk. Bryant Park is right nearby and their Winter Village and holiday markets with ice skating should be up and running in November.\\nhttps://bryantpark.org/amenities/the-rink\\nhttps://bryantpark.org/shop-eat/holiday-shops\\nCitizenM is another quirky and modern hotel but I think they only have King Bed rooms for 2 people which wouldn\\'t suit you. It\\'s not right in Times Square, it\\'s up on 50th St closer to Central Park.\\nhttps://www.citizenm.com/hotels/united-states/new-york/new-york-times-square-hotel\\nEdited: 7:47 pm, September 22, 2021 I can\\'t think of any fun/quirky hotels near Central Park that would be less than $400/night for 4 people. The historic ones are pricey too.\\nThe fun/quirky places are in other neighborhoods. The Freehand might be an option.\\nThe Knickerbocker is historic and gut renovated but closer to Times Square although also near Bryant Park.\\nThe Refinery might work, also near Bryant Park (where there’s an ice rink). The building is a converted hat factory and has a restaurant and a rooftop bar, both of which I think are open.\\nFurther uptown, the Arthouse on the upper west side might be an option, near Central Park. Hi,\\nI know the above named hotel was closed down during the pandemic but has anybody got any information on what’s happened to the building .\\n1, Has it been taken over by another company ?\\n2, Is there any likelihood of it opening up again as a hotel in the future ?\\nThanks everyone. The company that owned the building, a real estate investment trust (not Hilton, which merely operated the hotel), surrendered the building to the mortgage servicer in lieu of continuing to pay on the mortgage. The new owner hasn\\'t, to my knowledge, announced what it will do with he building Hi. We\\'re staying in NYC for 4 days in Dec 21 and are first timers. I know its a busy time of year but conscious it\\'s going to be extra busy now the travel restrictions from UK/EU have eased. Would you recommend booking tickets NOW for the likes of Statue of Liberty, ESB, 9/11 museum, Rockerfeller Centre? We\\'re definitely booking the theatre now. Thanks. Statue of Liberly/Ellis Island is one of the most sought after attractions. Book now through Statue Cruises (only.) Yes. As of right now many places are operating at limited capacity. If you know you want to do to a particular museum or what have you, book now. ***Would you recommend booking tickets NOW for the likes of Statue of Liberty, ESB, 9/11 museum, Rockerfeller Centre?***\\nFor the SOL/EI, yes, reserve as early as possible and only through Statue Cruises.\\nFor observatories, I would wait and see what the weather is like. It\\'s not that enjoyable going to an observatory if it\\'s densely foggy outside for example.\\nI would reserve the 9/11 Museum as it gets closer. If you are fixed to a certain day/time, then by all means go for it. My concern would be weather and fitting in the outdoor activities on nice days and if there is a rainy day, that\\'s perfect for museums. Hi all,\\nI\\'ll be in NYC the middle of March. What kind of weather can I typically expect?\\nThank you. Anywhere from snow and cold to 50-60 degrees and sunshine...at times. For it to be untypical.\\nA better question: what to pack? Leather jacket or lined raincoat or lighter weight puffer. A heavy sweater that can be layered and easily taken off. A scarf. An umbrella. Footwear that can get wet (either rain or snow). Sunglasses. A bag to toss the sweater if you don’t need it during the day. Thank you, both, and thank you especially for rewording my question. March is a time of transition between winter & spring so weather can be changeable. Pack to dress in layers. You can see historical weather here. As others have said, it can vary dramatically.\\nhttps://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/us/ny/new-york-city/KLGA/date/2021-3-17 Very detailed online weather forecasts are available for NYC and just about everywhere else in the U.S. Check the day before your trip starts, or even on the day you leave if you have the time, to see what you need to wear and pack. Weather forecasts for the following 2 to 3 days are generally quite reliable. Some good forecasters are:\\nhttps://weather.gov (National Weather Service)\\nhttps://accuweather.com\\nhttps://theweather.com (The Weather Channel) ***Anywhere from snow and cold to 50-60 degrees and sunshine...at times.***\\n^^This.^^ I thought it might be helpful to report that, while this year\\'s show is located in the actual Fashion Institute space (under the Egyptian galleries), the LINE forms around the Temple of Dendur.\\nWhile guards do direct you there from the Egyptian galleries, an easy way to get to the end of a long line is to enter the Temple of Dendur from the American Wing. I went on the first day of public admissions, but the line was around two sides of the Temple of Dendur by 11:00 AM.\\nOnly for those who are concerned, despite the fact that the Met checks vaccination records and requires masks: The Fashion show has narrow aisles and struck me as having a large number of visitors per square foot of walkable space. Did you like the exhibit? The actual Costume Institute space downstairs is not that large. In recent years they used temporary exhibit galleries elsewhere for these very popular exhibits. The last thing I saw in the original space was mourning clothing including a black dress from Queen Victoria with a 60-inch waist (she was 60 inches high too).\\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2021/in-america Not only is that costume space downstairs not large, it is, in my experience, claustrophobic and poorly ventilated. Even in pre-pandemic times I sometimes felt the need to flee. I can only assume (or at least hope) they have improved the ventilation to bring it in line with pandemic best practices.\\nCostume shows are big money makers for the Met so can see why they might want to pack in as many as possible.\\nEdited: 3:38 pm, September 21, 2021 Does anyone have any experience with wait times to get into the exhibit? Looking at going in a few weeks but am unsure of how much time to devote on a Sunday afternoon if lines are long. I liked the exhibit, but I would have liked it less with a one-hour wait. I make that comment because the Alice Neel painting show WAS worth a one-hour wait. But it\\'s personal taste. I posted because there are so many inquiries her (over a period of years) about clothing, textiles, and costumes.\\nAs usual, 10% of the garments are actually ... ugly. Only one cubicle had more than one mannequin in it, and in that case they were different sizes and different genders. I do think that many of the garments were not, say, Size 6 or 8. (I don\\'t actually know what the standard marketing size was in the mid and late 20th Century.)\\nIn some cases, the feet have been decorated with strap-on steel toe protectors, like workers in a paper mill (or the Federal Reserve gold vaults) might wear. Style over substance.\\nThere was only one non-clothing item in the show, which was a quilt under glass that had the signatures of a number of important 19th Century Americans. It was too big to study closely, but I liked it. I found Hawthorne and Longfellow, looking for famous Bowdoin graduates.\\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/15391 Thanks Obs. I\\'d seen the quilt in an article about the show but hadn,t realized what it was.☺️ Thanks for the review! We are considering going but now leaning towards the Christian Dior. Probably apples and oranges, but if you had to pick one...which one? Haven\\'t see Christian Dior yet. I may not see it because I tend to boycott Brooklyn Museum shows that are not included with Discretionary Admission entry. I assume that it is that category, but haven\\'t been there since the Pandemic. Note that the Brooklyn Museum (which is a superb, wide-ranging museum) is quite a subway hike from Manhattan. In that sense, I would question skipping a one hour line in Manhattan to spend 45 (?) minutes each way to the Brooklyn Museum.\\nI did not mean to put anyone off by my comments, just giving an honest opinion. Perhaps it would be useful to observe that the massive Met show \"Medici Portraits\", while loaded with stupendous work, probably has 10% of unrevealing, workmanlike paintings as well! The times the Met has put giant Fashion show in other spaces, flooring over the Lehman Pavillion, for example, it has had more than 10% ugly stuff. (Opinion!) Haha, fair enough (love the 10% ugly estimate!). Last fashion exhibit we saw at the MET was Heavenly Bodies in 2018 and it was, IMHO, exquisite. I expect this one will be slightly underwhelming in both garments and space. I have a very hard time with “ugly”. It imposes the standards of ready-to-wear retail-able clothing on what is presented as art. Nothing is walking out of that exhibit into Macy’s. But rather, it should open a dialogue.\\nThese Costume Institute exhibits are not about selling clothing to the masses. They are about art. Was expressionism welcomed at first? What did they say about Jackson Pollock at first? Cubism? These exhibits are meant to challenge how we think about the intersection of art and the human body as the canvas. Ugly? No uglier than Willem de Kooning was perceived once upon a time.\\n(I think I bought something from yohji Yamamoto’s first American collection. It was definitely not pretty. Just powerful).\\nEdited: 1:40 pm, September 22, 2021 Hello there.\\nSomeone on a travel site described New York at Xmas as a super premium experience, but didn\\'t quantify.\\nCould anyone here confirm this is the case, and what exactly makes the city such an experience at that time?\\nWith the cold weather and presumably a limited (or lack of) usual New Year\\'s eve related outdoor events this year, I\\'m struggling to understand the benefits over say summer time.\\nThanks. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13419686-Christmastime_in_NYC_2020_What_s_On_Dates_Updates-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHere is last year\\'s list of Christmas activities. This year\\'s should be posted in s month or two. Only you can decide what is super premium for you. I think that with the snow and the window dressings and the tree at Rockefeller center they really exude the holiday season. Snow is not usual at Xmas time. But NYC gets very well “dressed” for Xmas. One of the highlights has always been the decorated store windows but with some of the stores now closed (Lord & Taylor always had wonderful windows and is now gone along with Barney\\'s) and with other stores struggling financially, I\\'m not sure whether the Xmas windows will be as spectacular this year. But still, the lights everywhere are very festive and the Xmas markets are fun along with ice rinks and Xmas shows. NYC is summer is hot and humid and can be oppressive. The benefits are that NYC has a certain \"buzz\" about it which starts right after Thanksgiving and ends on NYD!\\nWe have the department store decorations, the multiple Christmas/holiday markets/ice skating at various locations/neighborhoods decorated with holiday lights/the rush to shop/restaurants and stores(non department) all decked out/etc.\\nI could go on an on.\\nThe holiday season is my favorite time of the year. I have not spend the season outside of NYC...save for the first 3 years of my life. NYC has it all.\\nAs Christmas gets closer, I see more people rushing to finish their gift shopping, more people hanging as they take time off and the excite meant building up.\\nThen when Xmas is over, we have that buildup to NYE in Times Sq or other locations in the city.\\nYeah...I know there are other world cities that can do the holidays up. But I don\\'t think there is anywhere like NYC during that month+ period.\\nI love the summer in NYC, but the holiday season is my favorite! Sounds good to me!\\nThanks for the input. Also, google for pics for over the top Christmas decorations in Dyker Heights, a neigborhood in Brooklyn. Well worth a visit one evening. Can\\'t remember how much those were affected by the pandemic last year nor what it will be like this year. We last visited NYC in early December 2019, and the Rockefeller Tree had only just been lit, and some festive things were starting just after we had to depart. We have booked to go back again this coming December, but are going from 12-17th so we should be able to experience and see bit more of the festivities this time.\\nStore window dressings are amazing in NYC though, and we had some snow last time (not too much) which made it better also. Just wondering, are there likely to be any restrictions in place for gathering in Times Square etc on NYE? >>>Just wondering, are there likely to be any restrictions in place for gathering in Times Square etc on NYE?<<<\\nNobody knows at this point in time. However I would not be surprised if there are. NYCity has one of the most (perhaps THE most) restrictive COVID policies in the US. Proof of vaccination and masks are required in many places including museums, theater and the indoor parts of restaurants.\\nRegarding snow .... it always snows on Christmas in NYC in the movies. It\\'s much less frequent in real life. I have visited NYC for the past 6 years, several times each year and always in December, closer to Christmas (except last Dec due to COVID). I\\'m a warm weather girl, hate the winter and cold weather.\\nHowever, NYC is as I always refer to as being it\\'s most magical, all dressed up in holiday splendor wowing visitors with sounds, sights and experiences that don\\'t compare to any other time of the year. There is always something that catches your eye and often your heart.\\nI\\'m not a religious person, but a visit to St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral is always a must and very special.\\nStrolling the streets looking at the beautiful holiday decor whether in storefront windows, restaurant entrances, hotel lobbies and courtyards, winter markets...it\\'s all around.\\nThe festive atmosphere, beautiful tree and lights, around the ice skating rink at Rockefeller Ctr.\\nThe dancing and singing of Salvation Army kettlebell ringers in front of a department store, while a homeless person wrapped in his blanket danced along to Chuck Berry\\'s Run Rudolph Run as if he was living the grandest life ever was one of the most heartwarming moments I\\'ve experienced while in NYC. Here he was the poorest of persons, yet the richest in his heart.\\nThe buzz of hurried holiday shoppers winding through those moving at a slower pace wondering what they have in their shopping bags and who the gifts are for.\\nWatching the carriage rides take off from the edge of Central Park, couples under warm blankets while the horse\\'s headpieces sparkle in the light.\\nIMO it seems as though people are kinder, there are smiles between strangers. First time visitors are in awe and you can see and feel their excitement.\\nI could go on and on...\\nI say YES to December! Hi everyone-\\nI hope this is helpful! I was in the NYC area for a funeral this past weekend, to make the most of it I booked a hotel room in Manhatten for one night, and extended our trip for a day to show LO the sights. This is not for the faint of heart but we had a fantastic time.\\nArrive in Manhatten at 9am:\\n-Dropped bags at the hotel. We stayed at the Casablanca, good location between times square and 5th ave. I am not a fan of times square but wanted LO to see the lights. Fantastic hotel and service. I highly recommend it.\\n-Took the subway to battery park to see the statue of liberty. I had hoped that this would be enough but he wanted to get \"up close\" so we took the staten island ferry round trip. Super easy to do. Our subway stop on the 1 train was \"south ferry\". When we got to Staten island we just rejoined the line for the ferry going back to Manhatten.\\n-Back on the subway and hopped off at the WTC Cortland stop to see the reflecting pools and the oculus. Did not tour the museum since he is a bit young for that.\\n-On the subway again to columbus circle. Spent the next 2 hours walking through central park (Wagner\\'s cove was our favorite)\\n-Arrived just in time for our 2pm reservation at the museum of natural history.\\n-Took the subway to Rockefeller plaza but Sunday subway service made our train an express. Cue minor panicking (but got off at the next stop and walked about 15 minutes instead.\\n-Walked through FAO Schwartz but was not impressed (I had a different experience when I was a kid). Left and went to the Lego store which was pretty impressive.\\n-Back to the hotel for a break\\n-Took the subway to the upper west side to meet the family at Fred\\'s. Great food and service. Recommend!\\n-After a lovely family member dropped us off at the hotel we walked to Junior\\'s off-broadway for an ice cream sundae and cheesecake (for me!)\\n-Walked back to the hotel and crashed\\n-Monday morning we walked to Bryant park and had pastries- so lovely\\n-Had breakfast at the Brooklyn diner on 43rd (holy hell those prices!). The service and food were great but I don\\'t see the value in a $20+ breakfast for a kid even though he ate all of the bacon.\\n-Took an Uber to JFK and off to home\\nA few notes:\\n-I hadn\\'t been to NYC for 10 years so I was a bit nervous about using the subway- don\\'t be! After getting orientated I felt right at home. If you get lost just ask someone for help!\\n-I swear times square is a massive 420 smoke out. I knew what to expect but was still a bit surprised.\\n-You will be asked for your covid 19 card and ID to dine indoors. Be prepared and please do not argue with the staff. They are doing the best they can!\\n-Bring/have cash. Most vendors and bodegas that we visited did not accept credit cards.\\nHave a wonderful time! Fun family trip. Thanks for your report. Thanks for sharing! I plan on bringing my 8 yo granddaughter in Oct. I hope she can walk a lot as your 7 yo did! Her Mom passed away this past March--- I gave her the choice of Disney or NYC---she chose NYC! Guess she heard me talking so much about my visits. And, I hope that Covid allows us to take this needed trip. You made wonderful memories you two will share! Loved your report. I had to read it. Was wondering what you were doing in Manhattan with a 7 year old trip report. ;) #Dvesp\\nIf you two start taking walks together, she should have the stamina needed to walk a distance by October.\\nIf not, bring an aluminum scooter.\\nEdited: 10:25 am, September 22, 2021 Thanks for sharing. What did your son think?\\nPS Not sure what a 420 smoke out is but it\\'s likely all that and more.🙄 Lovely report Thank you\\n#3 - Dvesp, I\\'m so sorry for your families loss\\nAgree w/ Stan some training walks could be a good idea. I\\'d also make sure that she has comfortable broken in walking shoes - which you can test out on your pre-trip walks A good whirlwind trip! I am sorry for your loss but glad you were able to add this NYC experience. **Not sure what a 420 smoke out is**\\nThis refers to April 20 being a weed \"holiday\". I guess the smell in Times Sq was noticeable.\\nI have passed by many times this summer and didn\\'t notice at all.\\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/19/18484698/what-is-420-meaning-marijuana-legalization Hello,\\nCurrently planning first trip ever to the Big Apple for about 10 days in spring 2022.\\nHaving family in the area, we are considering staying near the Grand Central Terminal, perhaps the Grand Hyatt.\\nOne of my favorite -hypothetically, having never been- locations is Bryant park along with the Public Library, so that could be convenient. Other than that, would you recommend the area for first timers that would want to go around pretty much anywhere within Manhattan and perhaps a little of Brooklyn?\\n(I realize there\\'s only so much we can see in just 10 days, but it\\'s a start).\\nIf I\\'m being honest, given the option to freely choose an area, I think I\\'d be more of a Chelsea, Village or Soho kinda person, but I\\'m wondering if it really makes a difference where we\\'d stay on the first time, and truth is we really want to be able to spend some moments with the fam.\\nThank you for reading, any insight would be higly appreciated!\\nS. Getting from Chelsea, the Village and SOHO to the GCT area is really simple. No reason to stay local to the area if you feel that you would enjoy another.\\nI would prefer the other areas as Grand Central is really \"drab\" in my opinion if not using the Metro North/checking out GCT. We leave for our first ever trip on Sunday, we\\'re only staying 5 days. I went with a boutique hotel in that area. The Library Hotel. Reviews were stellar and the price was about what I expected. I\\'ll post a Trip Report when we get back. Thanks so much, appreciate your answer!\\nWould you choose any of the 3 to stay for the first time, knowing I\\'d obviously want to sight-see but wouldn\\'t mind wandering around for 1-2 days in less touristy streets? Perfect, Tony, I\\'ll check it out!\\nThank you,\\nS. I would be happy in any of those areas you listed for a base.\\nI’m of the opinion that hotel location is important. Not just for subway links nearby but for your experience.\\nBut as a first time visitor you won’t really know what you prefer till you get here. After you are here, then in your wanderings you may see a neighborhood that you think would be better.\\nSo , my advice is pick the neighborhood that you can afford that looks the best to you for all aspects. Such as convenience to where your family lives, and to the sites you want to see.\\nI suggest using the transportation app such a Citymapper or Google ,put in the hotel choices and see how convenient they are to things you want to do and your family.\\nI like the flat iron district In Manhattan for its convenience of transportation and for the neighborhood itself. Has beautiful architecture, Madison Square, Park , many restaurants & shops. And the hotels are of different various price points as well\\nEdited: 9:32 am, September 21, 2021 We’ll be staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central in late October. This is between GCT and Times Square. I’ll report back on this hotel and the area. We chose this because we need to use Metro North to and from the Bronx to visit Fordham. First, many people mistake what area something is in. Be sure your family is really in the GCT area or if they just used that as a location you,d recognize to describe where they live. Residential areas near GCT are Murray Hill and Turtle Bay. Think about when you’re likely to see the family. If they work, dinner is probably when you’d get together and I\\'m sure they\\'d be willing to travel to meet you. Budget is typically the biggest factor in selecting a hotel. Why not do a hotel search and identify a few hotels in budget with the amenities you want in that area and a few others and then decide. You might also like to split the stay in 2 areas over the 10 days. In the GCT, the Affinia Shelburne is a suite style hotel. Some rooms have kitchenettes or at least a fridge and microwave. Rooms are a decent size. I believe the Grand Hyatt is closed and not scheduled to reopen. The building is slated to be demolished and replaced with a new supertall skyscraper in 2022. Nice hotels around there, nearer to Bryant Park include the Park Terrace and the Andaz 5th Ave (also a Hyatt property). Both can be expensive. The area has a lot of tourists, but also many great NYC landmarks, so it\\'s not a bad choice for a first time visit. Just a quick subway ride from there to Greenwich Village, Soho, or Chelsea, with a bit longer (but still easy) trip out to Brooklyn. Thank you so much for all your answers. I will be taking them into consideration.\\nSo many things to see, so little time, lol.\\nI\\'ll make a list of the must-see places and see what\\'d be more convenient.\\nAs for family, I have the exact address which is pretty close (0.2 miles) from the GCT and that\\'s what led me to thinking of staying around the station, so we can also have easy access to the landmarks by subway.\\nBut you\\'re right, it can also work the other way around, choosing an area I like better, yet close to a M station so that we\\'ll easily reach them as well.\\nI\\'ve got some studying to do! Visiting my son in February, he lives on the UES. We usually stay at the Arthouse and walk over through the park but I’m thinking in February we might be better off staying somewhere east and above 45th so we can take the subway. Looking for something near the Q or 4,5,6. Don’t want to spend Carlyle $’s, would like to keep it in the range of 175-250. Any recommendations? Rates can fluctuate significantly by dates, even in February. Presidents Day, school vacation times can raise rates. If you offer specific dates you may get better suggestions. Look at the Concorde on east 55 st. Thanks, NYwhiz! The Concorde looks perfect, I\\'ve gone ahead and booked. Son lives on 89th and 3rd so it looks like a straight shot on the 4,5,6. Plus while he\\'s working we have many options for how to spend our time. I\\'m glad it works for you. I recommended it to someone else with a child on the ues. She hasn\\'t reported back but it,s a quiet street and getting good reviews. The Affinia Gardens is on 63 st. & 3rd and more like serviced apartments but is usually much more expensive....but in February, it might be more affordable. Someone else said Costco has some deals on Affinia hotels. Either way, hope it,s a great visit. If you’d like something a little closer to your son, you might want to check out The Franklin on 87th between Third and Lex. I live in the area and walk by it everyday. Gets great reviews and very close to Central Park and the museums. Tons of restaurants in the area also. Thanks DMB. I’ve checked out the Franklin because the proximity is great and I will definitely give them a try on future trips. Only downside is that the rooms seem pretty small, I think I’ll try it on a shorter trip and probably during the summer when we’re outside more. Another vote for Affinia Gardens and the other Affinia hotels. Very spacious and affordable, especially this one in particular.\\nEdited: 3:02 am, September 22, 2021 what train stops between Grand Central and Cold Spring have car rentals within walking distance of train stop I\\'m not sure what you\\'re trying to do, but there\\'s an Enterprise in Croton that\\'s about a mile or so from the Croton/Harmon Metro North station. Enterprise will normally come and pick you up. I believe there are a number in downtown White Plains, including one (Enterprise) maybe a half mile from the station. There is also public transit (buses) in White Plains, as well as taxis, so you might consider these as well. There are also several car rental places in the Yonkers/Bronxville area, including two Zipcars -- one on Midland Av in Yonkers/Bronxville and another one that sounds like it must be near the Fleetwood Metro North stop, which is actually an area of Mt. Vernon, and the train stop right before Bronxville. Is it even legal to stay in nyc for 28 nights?\\nIm planning on a trip in october 2022 for 28 nights. I have been searching on airbnb for quite some time, and im my other post I got alot of people saying \\'\\'make sure its legal\\'\\'. which made me thinking ... is it illegal ?! I have never heard that airbnb is illegal, but now I found out that it CAN be in nyc. I have been searching the internet for some information , but since english isnt my first language, it can get quite hard to really understand sometimes. Thus far I figured out that (simply put) as long as the actual owner of the appartment is physically present while you are staying , it is legal. Also some stuff about you having to acces every room, the private room cannot be locked etc etc etc. Its quite alot to take in and understand. So , I decided to pay some extra for a hotel ... just to be sure. But now im all scared and worried that even that isnt legal for that amount of time :|\\nI booked CITY ROOMS NYC Chelsea , its at 368 8th Ave which is actually quite a nice location if you ask me. It isnt fancy though ...\\nBut, is this even legal? To stay at a place like that for 28 nights ??\\nYou might think im being silly , overreacting or w/e .. but it is my first solo-city trip , and I just want to be sure of everything :) I don’t see why not. I think in some areas it may be difficult to stay more than 30 days as I don’t know if that constitutes tenancy. The Department of Buildings record says 1) 368 8th Ave is a walk up apartment building 2) there have been complaints about illegal hotel use and 3) there are open building code violations\\nhttp://a810-bisweb.nyc.gov/bisweb/PropertyProfileOverviewServlet?boro=1&houseno=368&street=8th+av&go2=+GO+&requestid=0 @kaye , omg .. so even they are listed as a hotel and are kind of illegal ?! I just don`t know where to look anymore :O\\nI keep reading about the legalsystem of airbnb. it says that someone CAN actually rent a room aslong as the host is present. How will they ever do this? Does this mean the host has to be there 24/7? I mean, he/she cant really know when I come back to the apparement. OP what is your reason for coming to NYC for 28 nights?\\nAre you coming just to visit , or for a medical , educational or simialr purpose. Becaue if you are coming for medical , Educational or similar many of those organizations have access to such apartments\\nIf you are just coming to visit be aware that rents in the OUTER BOROUGHS , meaning Brooklyn and Queens are at least $2000 a month, which is like $80 a day and thats for good neighborhoods I don\\'t entirely know what is going on with that place you chose\\nI recommend you start a fresh thread with a title that will get the attention of the hotel experts so they can offer advice\\nWhen you repost specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station (OR if driving and need parking - directions of travel) and 4) hotel budget.\\nI don\\'t understand the spare room rental situation to be confident about offering guidance\\nEdited: 7:39 am, September 20, 2021 vacation/trip. No medical or anything else. I just want to explore whole nyc and really \\'\\'live\\'\\' there for a few weeks :)\\nI did find a bnb , in what I think is a outer borough neighborhood, but then agian. Is that legal?\\nI dont know if Im allowed to paste a link of that bnb though .. so i hope im not doing anything crazy :P\\nhttps://www.airbnb.nl/rooms/1628564?adults=1&check_in=2022-10-01&check_out=2022-10-29&previous_page_section_name=1000&display_extensions%5B%5D=MONTHLY_STAYS&translate_ugc=false&federated_search_id=4df0f8e7-1050-4fad-8e91-4dc0073dcd1e I do believe that AirBnB rentals are legal if you stay 30 days, wouldn\\'t it be easier to go to New York for 2 extra days or pay for the 2 extra days? A rental of 30 days may still violate building rules. And someone who rents their premises for both short stays and stays of 30+ days is still a law breaker (and may be shut down); do you want to do business with them? @jcmtl // that would be a good idea yes. But then agian : is it legal?\\n@MeeMee // that exactley. I dont care if its a airbnb or a hotel or w/e. I just want to be doing legal stuff there. Im not looking for anything illegal or trouble :( But ten agian : WHAT is legal. Its almost impossible to find something that is legit . As I thought by staying in a hotel, which is actually listed as a HOTEL , has still many complaints about illegal rental. Yes, a rental tenant or condo/coop apartment owner may not have the right to do rentals. Hi all, I’m looking for some hotel help! My husband and I are planning a quick anniversary trip to nyc nov 18-21. We have both been to nyc before but it’s been a long time. We don’t want to stay in a super touristy area like times square or midtown but we will be doing a few things in that area - Central Park, Broadway show etc. We are early 40’s and will be interested in great restaurants and maybe a little night life but nothing crazy. We are looking at a few hotels - Sheraton tribeca and the brand new spring hill in Chelsea but we are open to anything else in other areas for under $250/night. Flatiron area has also been suggested but it looks a little more expensive but is that location worth it? We would like to stay in a Marriott property. Any thoughts on these two and their locations or other suggestions? Thanks in advance! We stayed at the Sheraton TriBeca two weekends ago and enjoyed our stay. Close to lots of subway lines so easy to get to midtown or anywhere else, and a short walk to all the parks along the Hudson River or the other way to Chinatown.\\nI believe that SpringHill has delayed their opening until not long before you plan to arrive, if it is that property I would not trust it to be open on time\\nEdited: 10:14 am, September 17, 2021 Thank you that is super helpful, I was worried it might be too far away from many of the sites. Also I didn’t know that about spring hill suites so yes I think we will not take that risk! The AC Downtown near the Seaport is new and getting excellent reviews. The Moxy East Village has been very popular on the forum in a great area for restaurants and nightlife, but it pushes your budget ($250 before taxes). Both are Marriott brands, TownePlace Chelsea is another option. It,s just below midtown though on 28 th st. It,s also new. Sheraton Tribeca is in a great location for what you describe, and not too far from things. Have never stayed in that specific hotel but several times in the area. Lots and lots and lots of restaurants within walking distance. You can find a new, good place for breakfast, lunch and dinner for your entire trip within walking distance. Of course, I think you should eat elsewhere too but finding places nearby for some meals is easy. I don\\'t always stay in Tribeca, but since I love the area it is always one of the areas I look for hotels in when looking for hotels for any of my stays. Sometimes I choose other locations bqsed on value / prices, but really this is a grea location (and sometimes quite underrated too imo but I know I\\'m biased since I love the area). Residential, lots of restaurants and some not too crazy nightlife.\\nClose to a number of subway lines as mentioned so you can get anywhere where you want to go and sightsee easily.\\nThere are some Marriott properties in the Financial district as well, and some of them are fairly near Tribeca. The upside of Sheraton Tribeca is that it\\'ll put you closer to Soho as well as Tribeca. IIRC, that Townplace shares space with the SpringHill and also shares the opening day issues, so I\\'d avoid that as well for now.\\nHoping they both pan out as we like more choices! Thanks to you all, we booked the Sheraton tribeca. Can’t wait to go! Coming to NYC for 5 nights, in 3 weeks (provided there isn\\'t a COVID spike from NYC schools starting). This is our first time to the city and we are staying at The Moxy in Chelsea. I\\'m trying to get a rough idea of how to plan our days and hoping for some local/repeat visitor help.\\nDay 1 we arrive in early afternoon. Will likely just do check in, check out places walking distance. I might try to get a late spa appointment. Would be nice after a day of travel.\\nDay 2 I am looking at getting tickets to The Artechouse Museum for mid afternoon. Also considering the Chelsea market for shopping, could we fit in a trip over to SoHo for shopping on this day?\\nDay 3 I want to go to Brooklyn and see the Biggie Mural. If we took a subway to close to the Brooklyn Bridge, is it feasible to walk over and then catch another train to the mural? How long on average does it take to walk over the bridge? Could we squeeze the 9/11 museum into this day if we started early enough?\\nDay 4 Central park area. I would like to do a museum this day too. What are the big ones up that way? This is the night I\\'m thinking about going out dancing.\\nDay 5 hopefully not needing to recover from the night before. As of right now this day seems pretty open\\nAny tweaks or things we need to consider? Things that look unrealistic?\\nAre most places enforcing the vaccine proof? We want to try and go to places that are. The Empire State Building is not far from your hotel, that\\'s open until very late if you wanted to go there on your first night (night time is great to see the city lights) or even on your spare day at the end of the trip if the weather is good. Also near the hotel is Madison Square Park, the Flatiron Building, and Eataly for some Italian goodies.\\nYes you could combine Chelsea Market and SoHo. You could walk there in half an hour and pass through the West Village and Greenwich Village which is very nice. Call into Washington Square Park along the way.\\nTo get to the Biggie Smalls mural from the Brooklyn side of the bridge, take the C train from High St station to Lafayette Ave then walk. Or take the B25 bus (slightly longer trip).\\nhttps://yourbrooklynguide.com/notorious-big-brooklyn/\\nAllow an hour to walk the bridge, and you might able to fit in the 9/11 Museum if you went there first thing. But it\\'s a harrowing and sombre place, be prepared. Will you have kids with you?\\nThe big museums on either side of Central Park are the Met Museum on the east side, and the American Museum of Natural History on the west side. Combining Central Park with these is a great idea. You\\'ll need to book in advance for an entry time.\\nHave vaccination proof with you and ID and you\\'ll have no problems anywhere. Enjoy. when I go to Central Park I have a preference for the MET rather than the American Museum of Natural History, I prefer art over dinosaurs.\\nCentral Park is really large, here is the official map: https://centralpark.org/central-park-map/\\nYou might want to add Lincoln Center to that day, it\\'s beautiful. #1 - no kids, just us. That\\'s a good point about it being a very heavy experience. I\\'ll need to take that into account. Could be that an hour long walk after that could be good for us (movement to help mood).\\n#2- I think I prefer the MET too. I\\'ll have to ask my partner but pretty sure that would be his preference as well. Google maps gives directions walking, by subway or car (taxi) depending on which icon you pick and approximate time to travel by each, even factoring in time of day if you want.. It\\'s really easy to use. There,s also a feature that allows you to search “nearby” anything from restaurants to tourist sites.\\nMaps.google.com Google maps is useful for getting around.\\nAs is Citymapper app. It does the same gives directions for walking, subway, bus , commuter trains ,ferries or a combination in real time or a set time.\\nYou can also set it for directions for only one mode of transportation such as only the bus or only walking.\\nIt will give you Uber estimates of time and price.\\nIt also tells you how to exit /enter the subway &which subway car is the least crowded.\\nIt’s very easy to use and I prefer it to Google maps although my son and niece both prefer Google.\\nEdited: 5:00 pm, September 21, 2021 I hadn\\'t heard of Citymapper, but will check it out! One thing I do when using google Maps, the walking feature, I triple the time mentioned by Google Maps to take into account foot traffic, slowing down to look at something or take a picture or stopping somewhere. Trying to see if Bubba Gump are taking bookings as yet does anyone have any information at all. The Ball Drop page doesn\\'t seem to have any info on it as yet. Any help appreciated. The NYE plans have not yet been made public so venues may be waiting until things are clarified\\nOfficial TS website https://www.timessquarenyc.org/times-square-new-years-eve Thank you they have just emailed me\\nBack to say hopefully end sept but it’s over 21 so can’t go anyway as daughter is only 18! Arrive late on Monday Nov 8th and leave the morning of Saturday 13th, so essentially 4 full days and nights. Since sunset is around 4.30/4.45 at that time of year, we will have a lot more darkness than we would for a summer trip. Nights are also going to be colder and maybe not as conducive to wandering around neighborhoods. I am working on possible itineraries, and I\\'m trying to work out what is best done during the day vs during the dark, and what things might actually be nice after dark. Here\\'s what I have so far:\\nDaytime:\\n- 9/11 Museum (only open till 5)\\n- Central Park (and other parks)\\n- the new Summit at One Vanderbilt - I think I\\'d prefer to do that during the day\\n- ferry past Statue of Liberty (or going to the Statue and Ellis Island)\\n- walk part of the High Line\\n- wander through a couple of neighborhoods?\\nNight-time:\\n- Broadway show\\n- nice dinner (no bars of clubs due to underage companions)\\n- Times Square\\n- another observation deck\\n- Staten Island ferry to see Manhattan buildings at night\\nWhat else can you suggest for after dark? The 5 things above can be combined in some cases (e.g. Times Sq after Broadway), so we may have some time to fill.\\nThanks! On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the Main Public Library is open until 8pm. That could be a place to visit after dark. Following for some suggestions. I forgot to add that we are not museum or art gallery people. We went to a few in London a few years ago, but it\\'s not usually our thing. We would consider it if there was a really cool exhibit on that we had a particular interest in. I guess I\\'ll keep an eye on this nearer the time. Classsic Harbor Line has a sunset cruise that could combine the \"ferry past SOL\"-part (withouth actually setting foot on the islands - if you want to do that, that\\'s an event in itself) with an early evening activity.\\nOr if you like architecture, take their daytime narrated architecture boar tour. You can consider a sunset cruise, I\\'ve done one in the past and it\\'s beautiful to leave with the sun up and to come back with the city lights on.\\nThere is a Christmas Village at Bryant Park, it says it\\'s coming back in the fall, but I can\\'t find the dates. I agree with the others. The S.I. Ferry is not the way to see the NYC skyline at night \"There is a Christmas Village at Bryant Park, it says it\\'s coming back in the fall, but I can\\'t find the dates.\"\\nYes, I saw that - hoping it will be open while I am there - that would take care of some evening time for sure!\\nRe the nighttime skyline - I\\'ll look at sunset cruises. Is there any part of Central Park that\\'s pretty at night? I\\'m thinking of doing most of the Park during the day, then getting the last timed entry to the American Museum of Natural History (around 4?). After I come out it will still be rush hour, so I was thinking of where I could walk around until it clears a bit and I can go to dinner.\\nI\\'m not sure if the rink will be open, but pictures of it look pretty at night.\\nEdited: 1:46 pm, September 20, 2021 The Bryant Park holiday market will definitely be open (it opened Nov 1 last year), and the Union Square Market may be open as well. Little Island is neat after dark! If you do your shopping in the evenings that would leave more daylight hours for sightseeing. Lots of stores are open til 8pm, and some later. I have noticed that chain store hours vary with location, you could research which ones have later hours.\\nThe Kohl\\'s in Newport Centre is open til 9pm (note that other stores in the mall may not be open as late.)\\nH & M in Times Square and Herald Square are open til 10pm.\\nTarget in the Atlantic Terminal mall (Brooklyn) is much much bigger than the Manhattan stores and has excellent subway access, many different lines stop there including several express trains. Open til 10pm. The Empire State Building, The Edge and Top of the Rock are good at night. No glass to ruin your photos. One World Observatory is all enclosed with big glass windows so it\\'s a better one for day time imo.\\nI really like walking the High Line at dusk (check closing hours). The garden lights are very subtle and nice and the neighbourhoods along the walk start to light up.\\nYou might get more night time ideas from this Top Question: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k9262285-From_infants_to_20_year_olds_things_to_do_at_night_in_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nIt was written for kids but all of the things can be done by adults too. Hi,\\nThe closet week to Christmas I can have off work for my trip is the 27th November, will the markets be open then (Covid allowing), will the big store displays be up, will it be starting to feel Christmassy?\\nMany thanks https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13419686-Christmastime_in_NYC_2020_What_s_On_Dates_Updates-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHere is last year\\'s list of Christmas to-dos. Next year\\'s will be posted in a month or so. This Trip Report documents our second trip to the City. Our first trip was in 2014.\\nMonday September 13\\nWe arrived on Amtrak around 6:30 pm. Bought our subway cards and took the E train uptown to 53 and Lex. From there it was a short walk to our hotel for our stay, The Carvi. It is an updated Queen room with outdoor space. Just wat we were looking for our stay.\\nWe went out to pick up dinner but discovered the restaurant we had found on Google was now a storefront that had a For Lease sign in the window. It had been a long day of travel, so we saw a McDonnell’s and went there.\\nTuesday September 14\\nThis morning we took the subway to Hudson Yards to check out what had been build since our last trip. We found a large plaza with the Vessel and the Shed surrounded by tall buildings, but not many people.\\nWe then walked over to the reason we were here, The Highline. The last time we were in the City we stayed close to The Highline and would go there in the evenings to walk and enjoy the atmosphere of it. While The Highline in my opinion has improved with age, many of the old buildings gave The Highline its character has been replaced with new buildings clad with glass.\\nMy wife wanted to see the new Little Island, so we walked over to it and walked around to its highest point. For Lunch we stopped at Chelsea Market.\\nAfter Lunch we took the subway down to the Oculus. This is a futuristic subway/train station that was having a dance demonstration in its large open area when we arrived. From the Oculus we walked across the street to the World Trade Center Memorial. This is always a very moving place for me. I was please to see that added to the Names were the unit of the FDNY or NYPD that they belonged along with a small American flag inserted in the name.\\nNext was a short subway ride down to Battery Park. We walked along the water, then bought some ice cream and found a bench in a shady spot. It was a nice way to end our afternoon.\\nAfter freshening up at our room, we went out looking for pizza. We found Margari Pizza on 2nd Avenue between 56th and 57th. We received a hot, made to order pizza and view of 2nd Avenue out of the open windows.\\nAfter Dinner we went for a walk up 2nd Avenue into the 60’s and crossed over to Central Park. Ended walking around the zoo and turned around because it was getting late. We left the park and walked down 5th Avenue and turning at 55th to go back to our hotel.\\nWednesday September 15.\\nWe walked a couple blocks over to the Roosevelt Island Tram. With just a swipe of a subway card you get wonderful views of the East River and the surrounding area. From the tram it is a 5-minute walk to the Café at Cornell Tech. We picked up coffee and pastries and sat down by the river. While the City is hectic, there are many of these types of places you can go to enjoy.\\nAfter our coffee, we walked over to the subway and went to the south end of Central Park. We hit all of the highlights south of 77th like the Sheep Meadow, the Ramble, Bethesda Fountain, and the Mall. For Lunch we pick up a sandwich and ate outside on tables at the corner of 7th Avenue and 57th.\\nThis late afternoon we took the subway over to Brooklyn and walked to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. More great views of Downtown, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. This is another place to and enjoy the City.\\nFrom the Promenade we walked over to the Brooklyn Bridge. I was glade to see that the Bikes had been moved down to the street level. Our walk did not seem so crowed now that we can walk in what was the bike lane,\\nThere were a couple of people who did not get the memo and rode their bikes up with the pedestrians. Also, we were past by someone on a dirt bike while on the bridge. Are they legal in NYC?\\nThursday September 16\\nWe had Breakfast at the New York Luncheonette on 50th Street between Lex and 3rd. We ate out in the eating area in the street. It was a good breakfast with much going on around us in the street.\\nToday we took the subway to the north side of Central Park. The north side is very different from the south side or what I have come to believe, the tourist side. The north side has no pedi-cabs, street vendors or musicians. Instead, it is more lade back (for NYC) with mommy and me classes, bird watchers and joggers. We took our time walking south, stopping from time to time at a bench in the shade to take it all in.\\nWhen we heard that Broadway was coming back, that day I was able to obtain tickets to Wicked. We had never seen Wicked but had always heard great things about it. I believe that we were very lucky to see Wicked at this time.\\nThere was an electricity in the air as we waited to get in the theater that did not abate once we were in. This was only the 3rd show since Covid for Wicked. When the orchestra started playing, the crowd started cheering and clapping. The crowd’s noise level did go down until Glenda dropped down in her Bubble(?). Glenda had to wait for a couple minutes, and came out of character and said, “We are so happy to have you back”. The crowd went wild at that with more cheering and clapping.\\nYes, it was a great show. On the subway back to our hotel a man who had a card on is bag from a local financial services company serenaded us with his version of My Way. He said it was his way to relieve the stress of the day. I thought it was a fitting ending to our evening.\\nFriday September 17\\nIt was time to leave. We went to Moynihan Train Hall, and I was very impressed. There was a nice waiting area off to one side for passengers to wait. There were even tables with charging ports.\\nThank you for reading my Trip Report. We enjoyed our short visit to the City and are looking forward to when we can return and explore more. Thanks for reporting back. Great that you got to see Wicked. I happened to have seen it in Philadelphia because my sister\\'s friend (Julia Murney) had the lead in the touring company at that point, and enjoyed it.\\nAnd no, those dirt bikes are illegal and the NYPD just demolished a big batch of confiscated ones on Staten Island. Sorry to hear that they are still around there.\\nEdited: 4:52 pm, September 19, 2021 What a wonderful time you had.\\nI love love love the northern part of Central Park.\\nThe experience at Wicked gave me goose bumps.....\\nThanks for writing your Trip Report. What a fun experience at Wicked! Thanks for sharing. It sounds so enjoyable to have just gone and walked about NYC, it really is one of the tops things I find myself wanting to do when I feel like getting back into travel. As wonderful as many of the attractions are, there are just so many places to walk. Thanks for the trip report.\\nWe are also taking Amtrak from MN to NYC at end of month. Any thoughts to share about your experience on Amtrak from IL to NYC? Thanks for sharing your days in the city! Nice to see a trip report with a show in it! I really enjoyed reading your report. I keep wanting to take the Roosevelt Island Tram and never seem to fit it in. You reminded me that I need to fit it in one of my trips. Beautiful trip report. Glad you enjoyed! *** We picked up coffee and pastries and sat down by the river. While the City is hectic, there are many of these types of places you can go to enjoy.***\\nYes! Absolutely this! The thing I love so much about the city and what makes the most memorable parts of my trips are those quiet moments in peaceful spots tucked away all over the place. Sounds like you found quite a few special times like that.\\nI loved hearing about the northern part of Central Park. I’ve never been up there before, but it sounds just like my cup of tea.\\nThank you for sharing! :) Great report!! I may want to take the tram to Roosevelt Island. And what about neighborhoods that no longer exist, Like New Lots (One of the original towns of Brooklyn), Its only remembered in passing due to New Lots Ave @ter1413 — great link! Thanks Ter.\\nIt was an interesting read. As far as I know the neighborhood of New Lots still exists as a sub-neighborhood of east new york. Hi,\\nI’m travelling from JFK to Dubai on oct 7th, I’m staying at millennium hotel times sequare,\\nWhere can I make the covid test for international travell? How much it’s cost?\\nDo we need appointment?\\nHow long it will take to get the result?\\nThanks in advance Thank you,\\nI found labq is free, but is it valid for international travell? LABQ is accepted by the UAE Hi! Are COVID vaccine cards required to enjoy most of NYC? I ask because we plan to visit in December and while adults are vaccinated I do not plan to have my 12 year old vaccinated. Recently I saw an awful\\nNews report of a hostess being assaulted for asking for proof of vaccination. So it made me think that maybe most of NYC businesses are requiring this. Is this the case? Just trying to get information. I agree that every business should be able to decide who they will serve. This will clarify which venues require proof of at least dose of Covid vaccine:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page\\nEdited: 1:19 am, September 19, 2021 I responded to your first post, but in case you didn\\'t see it:\\nNYC has a mandate in place requiring proof of at least one vaccine for entrance indoors for a multitude of businesses. Whether you agree or not with that law is irrelevant. Your choice is to produce legal proof of vaccine to gain entry or don’t try to enter. If this is a barrier for you to enjoy your vacation, please consider a different destination.\\nThe mandate can be reviewed here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page Also understand that things can change by december and maybe by then they will require full vaccinations. We don\\'t know but it would not surprise me if the rule changes over time. In addition, even though it is not required by the city restaurants are allowed to bar people who are not FULLY vaccinated. Some restaurants have elected to do so one shot may or may not be enough unless it is a single dose vaccine. Also understand that things can change by december and maybe by then they will require full vaccinations. We don\\'t know but it would not surprise me if the rule changes over time. In addition, even though it is not required by the city restaurants are allowed to bar people who are not FULLY vaccinated. Some restaurants have elected to do so one shot may or may not be enough unless it is a single dose vaccine. The NYC rule requires people 12 years old and older to be have at least one vaccination. It is not up to the restaurants. This is a city mandate. You will be pretty limited if the 12 year old is not vaccinated. I would consider going somewhere else, since December is quite cold to be stuck with only being outside.\\nEdited: 1:32 am, September 19, 2021 Many places are simply not letting kids under 12 in. I think some are letting them in if they have negative test within 72 hours of entrance, but that is not uniform, and honestly don\\'t know what law says.\\nFor example, for its four-week fall repertory season starting this Tuesday New York City Ballet will not allow anyone in who is under 12 years old and all people 12 and older have to have proof of vaccination and wear masks. However, as of right now, for their Nutcracker season starting in late November they will allow children under 12 who show proof of negative result on COVID test taken within 72 hours of performance. (For the fall rep season they also seem to be eliminating intermissions; don\\'t know what they will do for Nutcracker). Another condition of entering their theater is that if you do get sick you agree not to sue the ballet, the theater, their boards of directors, etc. If you want to claim a religious or medical exemption to these rules you have to write to them and their website has info on where your letter should be directed.\\nI walked by a higher end restaurant the other day and believe what the policy posted on their door said was that all people 12 and older had to have proof of vaccination and any children under 12 had to have negative result on test done within 72 hours before entering the restaurant. This particular restaurant has no outdoor dining so eating indoors and complying with the rules is the only option.\\nEdited: 2:30 am, September 19, 2021 Also note that, despite the fact the city rule requires only one shot, some venues may require proof that you are \"fully vaccinated.\" New York City Ballet, for instance, requires proof you are fully vaccinated with a vaccine approved by the FDA or the WHO (and they have on their website a list of those WHO-approved vaccines people have gotten in other countries), along with your photo ID. I agree with red, I expect rules to get stricter as the pandemic continues to run amok. Many hotels have some sort of restaurant or Bar inside them, so it could be those that have them will enforce the policy That makes no sense Howard. Bars and restaurants are able to check for proof of anyone sitting in\\nI dont expect any changes by December which is only a few months away. If anything rules may actually ease to exclude young children (12-15) and other groups once they start realizing the consequences of the current policy Be sure to carefully read the links above. The requirements is for many indoor activities\\nAs vaccine availability expands to even younger age groups, as it is likely to do soon, the requirements may expand - especially as we head into a season where outdoor activities are reduced\\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/08/18/1027035486/covid-vaccine-children-under-12-your-questions-answered If your 12 year old will not be vaccinated, I would choose somewhere else to vacation. As we get closer to winter, rules and mandates will probably get more restrictive. And even if NYC keeps in place exactly what they have now, how much fun will NYC be for your child? Your child won\\'t be allowed to visit any museums, shows, sit inside at restaurants, etc. Basically, your child will be allowed in the hotel, walk around outside in December, and only eat takeaway unless you find a restaurant with comfortable outdoor seating in December.\\nMy 18 year old daughter and I (both fully vaxxed) are supposed to visit NYC just before Christmas because we have tickets to \"Dear Evan Hansen,\" and I\\'m not sure if we\\'ll make the trip due to COVID concerns. I\\'m just going to wait until we get closer to the date and decide then.\\nGood luck with your vacation decisions. It\\'s all very stressful. Does anyone know a website other than Yelp that tracks which restaurants are still open after the pandemic? I want to start researching restaurants to try and would like to know which are open before traveling to them. Or is Yelp the best option? I like this website for restaurant openings:\\nhttps://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/new-nyc-restaurants-openings Thank you, @jcmtl ! :) When you google a restaurant it will show you whether a place is open or closed (eg google Pam Real Thai Food NYC). If its open you should be able to see recent reviews Eater.com has kept a running list of restaurants that have closed during the pandemic. https://www.google.com/amp/s/ny.eater.com/platform/amp/2021/8/20/22605594/nyc-restaurant-closings-august-2021\\nBut I’m not sure that will help you, practically speaking, to scroll through the list to find ones that you want to go to. How are you compiling your list? If you try to make a reservation, if they are no longer open (or still “temporarily” closed), you will discover that when you plug in your date and time. Or, do what I do as I’m compiling a list in anticipation of my own travel next month: get your list together. Then go to each website and check. (I read menus too).\\nI never use Yelp, except accidentally when a Google search leads me there, I find it unhelpful and unreliable when I’m researching. I check primary sources - that is, the restaurant’s own website, for most accurate up-to-date information. To find restaurants I want to go to, that is, to compile my list, other than friend referrals and emails I receive, and periodicals I read regularly, probably Eater and The Infatuation are my 1 and 2. I use Yelp a lot. Not when it comes to check opening times, for this I go to the restaurant\\'s own website - also for checking menus to see if I like a place. But yelp is good for actually finding restaurants in areas where I want to be so I can look into the ones that look interesting more closely. I like Yelp to save the places of interest. I find them through Yelp, here, Reddit, random Instagram posts, Tic Toc, magazine articles, all over. I can be picky (so I have been told) so I like researching places to eat. I was telling a friend today that I was worried I wasn\\'t finding enough places and then noticed in my saves that I have over 80 places that sound good. I think I\\'ll be good! Google and Yelp can be helpful, but I\\'ve found both to be incorrect every once in a while.\\nForget secondary sites, just go to the restaurant website or social media page.\\nAnd when in doubt, forget the good old web and simply phone a restaurant. If it helps, I love getting To Go from NYC markets. I’ve gotten a bottle of wine, cooked salmon, pasta, loaf of bread, cheeses and side of veges from Citarella Market on Broadway (UWS).\\nThe food in the deli is cooked fresh daily and seasoned beautifully. It’s delicious and far less expensive than eating in a restaurant with wine, tip, etc. I sometimes find opentable useful in getting current restaurant info. They also have separate sections on takeout, delivery and outdoor dining. Eater for new restaurant openings and their maps.\\nThen Yelp to look at star rating and pictures for established restaurants. I don’t worry about the individual reviews. Then going to the restaurant website for more info.\\nI often use google maps when I’m going somewhere and want to see what’s nearby. I zoom in to see what’s around and there are pictures and reviews for most restaurants and cafes. I then do further research to look up opening times and menus on their website.\\nInstagram and Twitter can be a good source sometimes. Using a hashtag like #newyorkfood brings up so many pictures. If I like the look of something I research further. Current pictures are usually from open restaurants.\\nEdited: 4:53 am, September 21, 2021 For anyone interested in booking a parade view room, I received an email from The Warwick that they are now taking reservations for these rooms. It says you must call the hotel and speak to Angela Calabrese at 212-314-7728.\\nI hope this information is helpful. Over 4 million passengers rode NYC subways and busses Tuesday, but passenger volume is still below pre-pandemic times:\\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/mta-breaking-pandemic-era-ridership-records-only-half-riders-are-backTuesday Well in 10 days it will go up by 2 more people! Can you tell we are excited? A week tomorrow for me. Just like you psblin, counting the days. When I was in New York in August I found the subway to be pretty empty (except on the Saturday). It was really clean. I have been blessed to go to many places on this planet. It is a privilege to spend another week in one of the greatest cities NYC! @pslbin - Looking forward to your trip report!! Hi, I will be travelling to NYC this October 12th to October 26th. I kind of have some things planned out, however I still haven\\'t quite finished my itinerary. Some days are kind of empty and would like to fill them more!

Oh lol forgot to mention im staying at my uncle\\'s, after I arrive at jfk ill go to his apartment, have some sleep before I go out and explore :)\\nEdited: 3:57 pm, September 20, 2021 One one of your free days - the Morgan Library & Museum & the main branch of the New York Public Library\\nwhich has nice exhibits & the building itself is nice. Say Hi to Patience & Fortitude for me. (the names of the lion statues in the front of the library.\\nIf the weather is nice grab a bite to eat at one of the kiosks in Bryant Park. If it\\'s not, I love the light filled courtyard café on the 1st floor of the Morgan in the back.\\nEdited: 5:44 pm, September 20, 2021 The Morgan looks beautiful,thank you! Ill definitely add it.\\nI love books as well, if you guys know any good book store (new or used) (besides Barnes and Noble) let me know :) Since you are in the area, take a walk into Boerum Hill and check out Books Are Magic on Smith Street.\\nYou can catch the F train to Carroll St and walk with the traffic up Smith St and you will come across the store.\\nThe area(Boerum Bill and Carroll Gardens) are great for just walking around. Loads of places to stop into, grab some food or drinks. On the Sunday you have Williamsburg, you might want to consider changing that to Saturday because the big Smorgasburg there is on Saturdays right by the waterfront and worth a look if you want some food.\\nOr go to the Prospect Park Smorgasburg on the Sunday.\\nhttps://www.smorgasburg.com/\\nA few more outdoor outdoor ideas if the weather is good: Little Island, on the west side of Manhattan, or Governor\\'s Island off the southern end of Manhattan. You\\'ll need a 5 minute ferry to get to Governor\\'s Island but it\\'s a great place. You can actually get a ferry there from Brooklyn on certain days of the week.\\nhttps://littleisland.org/\\nhttps://www.govisland.com/\\nThe Cloisters is included in your Met ticket, that\\'s a subway ride or bus ride further up Manhattan.\\nAnd seeing that you\\'re staying in Dumbo, you might want to take a look at the Brooklyn Historical Society, the nearby Jane\\'s Carousel (very pretty) and check out the Time Out Market for some food. When you go see the Friends\\' building, look across the street, there\\'s the oldest wooden structured house.\\nI would move Bryant Park to another day and pair it with the New York Public Library and the Morgan Library suggested by blume.\\nI think you have too much on the Wednesday, since you do have the time, I would split that day in two.\\nSince you like art you could check out art galleries in Chelsea.\\nSince you like books I suggest the Strand Bookstore and the Drama Book Store. I would also suggest Rizzoli close to Madison Square Park. And in Chelsea there is the 192 Books. Thank you! Will definitely go to Smorgasburg, everything looks delicious! Little Island too & the Cloisters looks really cool. Apparently Brooklyn Historical Society is closed to the public :(. The BHS museum I was thinking of is inside the Empire Stores in Dumbo. The museum could be closed, but the Empire Stores might be good for a look around anyway. Is it ok for children attending Aladdin on Broadway to dress up in characters from the show? It\\'s always OK for kids to dress up whether in costume or in their Sunday best. When I was ushering I used to give props to the best dressed kid in my section.\\nEdited: 10:40 pm, September 20, 2021 Want to purchase tickets for Friday night\\'s Cheap Trick show at Irving Plaza. Prefer not to go through live nation and pay their \"convenience fee\" does anyone know when the Box office opens? I get a recorded line saying box office only open on performance days, there seems to be performance there every day. Tried calling just before a show, still got the same recording. Thanks Are you trying to buy from the box office on the phone? Or trying to determine when you can walk up to buy in person?\\nI don\\'t think buying on the phone is going to work Admission And Hours\\nVaries by performer. Tickets are available for purchase from the Irving Plaza Box Office in person only. (Hours: Noon-6:30PM, M-F, 1-4PM Sat, 1-212-777-6800). Phone orders are available through Ticketmaster (1-212-307-7171). Ticket limit of 4 per person ***Are you trying to buy from the box office on the phone? Or trying to determine when you can walk up to buy in person?\\nI don\\'t think buying on the phone is going to work***\\nAgreed and I doubt they\\'ll even answer the phone.\\nif you walk up and buy tickets, then you can skip that fee. If you want to buy in advance, you have to pay the fee. Looking to purchase in advance at the box office in person. Thanks See post #2 for hours. Looking for something where we can work from during the day- desk/some table and good wifi, not loud outside.\\nPlus clean rooms and bathrooms, would love a window or two in the rooms.\\nBudget 2500-3500 hopefully including taxes and fees\\nThank you. To add - a location where we can walk to eat/work if needed, cafes, local eateries, food trucks and boutiques would be great. We are young and active and ready to explore. Have been to the city many times before but never spent this much time.\\nWe would be up for splitting between two locations to cover more square footage. Contact Affinia hotels and see if they can accommodate you.\\nAffinia.com\\nThe San Carlos is another that might work. Hello- thank you.\\nAffina seems to have a few different properties. Any one in particular? They,re all good. Gardens will be most expensive. Shelburne is usually least expensive. For what you want, a 1 bedroom suite would be best so one of you can work in the bedroom while the other is in the living room, but prices online for the suites are over your preferred budget. By calling, they may be able to help you.\\nIn the past, the San Carlos has been most willing to provide discounted rates by phoning and it’s near the Affinia 50 but their rooms are looking a bit shabby. Still a good location and good space if you’re not too fussy about aesthetics.\\nYour other option is to find an inexpensive hotel and separately rent a work space. Poster Grandrue posted about a work space offer. I\\'ll try to find it and post here.\\nEdited: 2:20 pm, September 19, 2021 Here,s the post about workspace with a discount code. It\\'s from WeWork.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13675324-Workspace-New_York_City_New_York.html The workspace offer is from WeWork -- space from $29/day at some NYC locations, w/offer of free $29 day with code given in my other post. They have many locations in NYC. That’s interesting, didn’t even think about getting a discount via calling.\\nI’ll give it a shot! Costco has some deals for Affinity, I’ll try that too.\\nDo you have any recommendations for UWS or UES as well? Always been a dream to spend some time there.and with wework, we might not need to invest in a suite.\\nEdited: 5:21 pm, September 19, 2021 On the upper west side\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nis actually an all suite hotel and rooms are all like apartments. It\\'s well loved but looking dated Nd prices are sometimes high.\\nThe Arthouse Hotel is nice.\\nThe Newton is further uptown and a decent budget hotel.\\nThere aren\\'t many affordable hotels on the UES. The Affinia Gardens is considered UES on the edge of midtown.\\nThere\\'s a place called the FranklIn with very small rooms. It looks too expensive. I don,t recommend the Courtyard UES.\\nIf you decide to use a separate WeWork space for working, there are likely lots of other good options and I might consider 2 different locations. I didn\\'t check your dates but WeLive might fit what you are looking for. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post was determined to be inappropriate by the Tripadvisor community and has been removed.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nOur staff may also remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.

The only requirement we set is that you find a place near a subway station servicing multiple lines In order to give you a good recommendation we need exact dates of travel as hotel rates vary daily, budget including 15% taxes, bedding configuration & any desired amenities. New York in Christmas. Where do I start It\\'s much of a muchness where you stay because sights are spread all over Manhattan and nearby boroughs.\\nThere are a few hotels you could consider.\\nAbout a 10 minute walk from Times Square and most of the Midtown sights is the Residence Inn Central Park (south side). That\\'s an excellent hotel and it\\'s the highest hotel in North America.. It\\'s also walkable up to Central Park and it\\'s a very good location subway wise and good eating on 9th Ave.\\nOn the lower floors of that same building is a Courtyard hotel. They share the same lobby but the Courtyard rooms are lower and generally cheaper. The Residence Inn includes breakfast but the Courtyard doesn\\'t (unless things are now changed).\\nIf you want a kitchenette all of the Residence Inns have one, other locations are Midtown East and Times Square in that general area.\\nIf you decide on the Financial District, the Residence Inn World Trade Canter is pretty good and rooms are bigger than the Central Park one. That\\'s walkable to all of the downtown sights and very close to the Fulton Street subway hub to get you uptown. Breakfast is included there.\\nThe nearby Courtyard is also very good, not as big, rooms are smaller, no breakfast included, but they have some rooms with views over the 9/11 Memorial which is very pretty at night.\\nThen there are the Moxy hotels which are more modern, some have rooftop bars, and have smaller rooms. Kathryn, if you are asking a question please start a new thread and provide lots of info, like budget, interest, and especially what you need to know. It is important to note that just because a hotel has Times Square in its name it doesn\\'t mean that it is actually in Times Square. I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott New York Manhattan/Times Square and it\\'s next to Bryant Park not in Times Square.\\nI found that that location was good for many sights. It\\'s great news that the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Terminal has re-opened as of today, September 20th, albeit with a smaller menu. But it\\'s re-opened! Yay!! Where do you see the revised menu? Does anyone knows where in Manhathan can I get a PCR test with results in 24 hours? I just google 15 minute PCR tests and many came up. Pick whichever one works for you. Have a look at it. Keep in mind that 15 mins - 12 hr tests may not be free.\\nIn the past, i have been able to get it under 24 hours from NY Doctors Urgent care\\nhttps://newyorkdoctorsurgentcare.com/ -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 8:50 pm, September 20, 2021 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13668437-Where_can_a_visitor_to_NYC_get_a_cheap_PCR_COVID_19_test-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nRead through this thread\\nEdited: 5:28 pm, September 20, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

Just scroll down…\\nHere’s the main message:\\n“ As of August 17, people 12 and older are required to show proof they have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine authorized for emergency use by the FDA or WHO for:\\nIndoor dining\\nIncludes restaurants, catering halls, event spaces, hotel banquet rooms, bars, nightclubs, cafeterias, grocery stores with indoor dining, coffee shops and fast food or quick service with indoor dining\\nIndoor fitness\\nIncludes gyms, fitness centers, fitness classes, pools, indoor studios and dance studios\\nIndoor entertainment\\nIncludes movie theaters, music and concert venues, museums, aquariums and zoos, professional sports arenas, indoor stadiums, convention centers, exhibition halls, performing arts theaters, bowling alleys, arcades, pool and billiard halls, recreational game centers, adult entertainment and indoor play areas”\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page #1 sums it up pretty well. The mandate does not apply to outdoor dining only for indoor. Also, some restaurants/venues may go beyond the current city mandate and require full vaccination. Those restaurants would normally disclose this in advance .If you are making reservations somewhere I would check in advance. You would need to show your vaccine card (or the app) and a photo id. Getting takeout from a restaurant does not require a vaccine check it is only if you plan to stay and eat inside the location. I noticed some fast food places like mcdonalds and chipolte etc now no longer allow indoor dining and everything has to be takeout. The law says first shot is enough to enter. Some establishments are requiring both on an ad hoc basis.\\nOn a practical level. You arrive at a venue...whatever it is. You show your vaccine card or photo of it (or in a New Yorker\\'s case, the card on our app) AND your photo id, and then they lead you to your table. One place recently also took my temperature but for the life of me, I can\\'t remember which place. Staff remains masked, at least in every place I have been (in Manhattan). The whole thing takes a few seconds, it is not an ordeal. One restaurant (Koi) was very apologetic about asking, but otherwise, staff have been very matter of fact about it, in my experience. Although you have to be NY state resident to use NY State Excelsior pass, you do not have to be resident to use NY City Covid App, and I highly recommend downloading this app then uploading a photo of your card. That is all it is, a sort of framed photo of your card, it is not checked against official records anywhere, and no information you provide (basically your name) is shared anywhere. But it is a convenient way to carry your proof that is recognized by people at doors and front desks, and it can be enlarged if necessary.\\nEdited: 4:20 pm, September 19, 2021 Also note that not all restaurants have outdoor dining as an option, whether by choice or because DOT told them they can\\'t. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

Usually at the host stand, but at one place a person was in the doorway checking before you stepped a foot in. I have the excelsior pass which I have shown before, but I also just have a photo of my vaccine card saved to my phone in its own easy access album, so on occasion I’ve shown that instead (I basically go for whichever I see first when I open my phone). Both options have been accepted with no question. About 50% of the time I have been asked for photo ID as well, so they can cross reference to make sure the names match. Life is on as normal. No Issues. I show the phone app as i don\\'t carry my card. My friend shows a photo on the phone...no issues. I will be in the city towards the end of October and bringing our (vaccinated) 16 year old Spanish exchange student. I would love to surprise her with reservations at a great tapas restaurant.\\nBudget for 2 people-under $100 ideally\\nThanks! Its a good idea but I imagine after the tapas experience your exchange student will go \"well, this was fun, where to next for the proper meal...\". Tapas in Spain are snacks you have in the bar before lunch or dinner.\\nTry Salinas, Ta Pol, or Tomino Taberna Gallega and show her Little Italy. But you may struggle keeping it under $100 total\\nBut honestly, I would introduce her to new cuisines. Isnt that the point of exchange students\\nEdited: 2:09 pm, September 20, 2021 Noted on the difference between tapas and a full meal. I may reconsider what time of day.\\nBut in regards to your other point- she has been here a month already experiencing lots of types of cuisine. I thought she would take comfort in a meal that reminds her of home. She is quite young and doing something pretty brave for her age. Just trying to do something nice. Ahh, got ya. Makes sense\\nWhere in Spain is she from? Boqueria - there are several locations and it is pretty authentic (I have spent a lot of time in Spain) Mercado Little Spain at Hudson Yards - lots of choices there\\nCasa Mono if you want to go a little more pricey Socarrat is a good one too..!!!\\nhttps://socarratnyc.com/ Today I took the Ferry from Long Island City to Governors Island (With a change at Wall St), The weather was perfect today and I got some great shots. I thought I would share them. These are some of the best photos Ive taken\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/JaEaFDy Yes, those are some really great pictures, thanks for sharing.\\nToday was one of those \"top 10\" days. Those are great, howardform! Looks like a great day out. Thank you for sharing! Weather has been pretty lousy lately. It was nice to get a perfect day for a change I went to Hudson Yards in mid 2019 and visited Snark Park there. There was a rest area where there are some black \"sofa\"s (not real sofa in traditional sense, but they are like bean bag sofa). The closest picture I can find is from this frame in this video: https://youtu.be/DU9n8VZ-CE0?t=77\\nDoes anyone recognize those? What is the brand of them, and what they are called? I don\\'t see anything in the video that resembles a bean bag sofa. I do remember seeing in Snark Park tubes 2 or 2 1/2 feet in diameter, 10-20 feet long strewn around the floor that people were sitting on. I think they were maybe a darkish gray rather than black. Is that what you are talking about? They would certainly have been designed and made specifically for the space rather than off-the-shelf merchandise. If you really want to know about Snark Park, you need to contact the firm that is its designer, installer, and operator, Snarkitecture. You could have them custom-make the seating for you.\\nhttp://www.snarkitecture.com The \"sofa\" I was referring to appears in the video starting from 1:17 (where the link above should land), and it only lasts for about 2 seconds. Basically it is the area on which the girl from the video lies.\\nBut contacting them directly seems like a good idea. I will try to send them an email and see if I can get any luck there. Thank you for getting back to me! So I\\'m finally getting to run NYC Marathon. I\\'m someone who gets bad motion sickness and a fear of heights/bridges.\\nFirst question, are people susptible to motion sickness on the ferry? I do okay wearing the patch with boats, however I\\'m not sure how that will impact my running performance.\\nSecondly, will I feel the motion goign over the bridges? i was told to stay in the middle to avoid the height issue.\\nThanks Stay in the middle on the Verrazano as many men pee off the sides of the bridge at the start of the race.\\nMy brother who has run, I think, 17 times (at least), always says the 59th st bridge is hard to run. But not about motion. I’ve never heard that as a complaint from anyone I know who has run Well it is a short ride and you are never out of sight of land. Very few people experience motion sickness from the staten island ferry. If you are someone who is ultra-sensitive to it then I guess take precautions. One thing you could do maybe is be towards the back of the crowd during boarding vs being one of the first people on. That way you minimize your amount of time on the ferry. Not sure if you can feel any motion on the bridge. I wouldn\\'t think so but with all the people going over at once I don\\'t know if it gives any sort of slight sensation. I do know that if you are in a stopped car on the George Washington Bridge, you can feel it going up and down. For the race, I believe there will be no traffic on the bridges and you will likely not feel anything. The ferry is a smooth ride and I rarely see people getting sick from it. It is a short ride.\\nYou will not feel any motion going over the bridges. The biggest vibration I felt was when the runners were crossing the bridge at the start of the Verrazzano. It is sheer joy crossing that bridge at the start. The Queensborough or 59th street bridge is tough since it is hard concrete crossing that bridge at around mile 16.\\nCongratulations on getting into the race and have a great race day. Enjoy the experience since there is nothing like it in the world. Congrats on getting to the race! In my experience (4 time finisher, dropped out at 19 another time), you will not feel any motion on the bridges. I do remember the first time I ran (back in 2005), there was a weird, mesh surface on the Willis St bridge, but if memory serves (my last NYCM was 2015) that is no longer the case.\\nThe Verrazzano is by far the highest and most open (especially if you’re on the top level), so once you surmount that you should be fine. The 59th St bridge is tough because of where it is in the race, but it’s so enclosed the height barely registers.\\nIt may help you to know that one of my running buddies has a severe fear of heights - they won’t run over the Brooklyn Bridge, for example - but has finished the marathon multiple times with no issues. I would not wear the patch before running. As people said, you should be fine. If you are that concerned, consider \"seabands\". They are bracelets that use acupressure to prevent motion sickness. They are not expensive and you could even throw them out when you get off the ferry. re: the ferry, as others said it\\'s a short ride, and it\\'s also a pretty big boat, so you don\\'t tend to feel much movement - mostly you\\'ll feel the engine but that\\'s kind of it. I used to live on Staten Island so I took the ferry every day to and from work, and I\\'ve never seen anyone look like they had any sort of trouble with motion sickness. Hi! I’ll be stopping in NYC for 24 hours between JFK flights. Looking for recommendations on an area to stay where I can walk to fun restaurants, see a good atmosphere, enjoy a quick day off. Would also like to subway from JFK since I’ll be coming and going during traffic times. Any ideas of fun areas outside of Manhattan since it’s a bit far for a short time? We’ve been to NYC so don’t need tourist thing but just a nice atmosphere and safe area to walk around would be great. You can get to and stay anywhere in NYC that you\\'d like to.\\nIf you post on the NYC Forum (this is the NY State Forum, with many fewer visitors) with some specifics about what you like to do we can give specific advice Hi I added this as a query to a shopping question - not received an answer!\\nSo on a separate thread do any of you wonderful New York responders have any information about the reopening of Century 21?\\nThanks The original owners have bought the company\\'s intellectual property, which would be the company\\'s name and trademarks. The merchandise was likely bought by salvage companies and shipped overseas. A statement issued this past spring said that the intent is to reopen stores, but it didn\\'t say which locations or when. The NYC mayor and other politicos issued ecstatic statements of their own. The company\\'s website today doesn\\'t give any date for any reopening. Assembling the merchandise selection would be a lengthy procedure.\\nAbout 5 or so years ago, Century 21 opened a store in a lackluster shopping mall north of Pittsburgh. Opening a store in that mall is a sign of incompetent management, IMO. It was such a dreary store, I never went back. The store didn\\'t last long I thought I read that the Cortland Street store had been sold. At least it has been up for sale. So if/when it reopens it will be in a different location.\\nEdited: 1:44 am, September 20, 2021 Just wanted to know, since there is construction going on the skywalk is closed. If I take the shuttle which is my only way to get to terminal D I hope I don’t have to go through security again. Does anyone know ? My time in between is 36mins😭 I would definitely talk to the crew & airport staff. The Shuttle I\\'ve taken also went to the parking lot so it was outside of security, but I would hope there would be another option, for people that have checked in already. If your transfers with he same airline the crew can coordinate with the other flight crew sometimes, and the airport staff will know the best method to get over to the other terminal.\\nEdited: 4:50 pm, September 19, 2021 Thanks! Yeah just nervous about the time limit I have. I will ask the crew to help since it’s the same airline again Hello—I have read the New York State rules on covid 19 protocols but am looking for actual experience with entering stores and bakeries with a non vaccinated 10 year old—wanting to do a quick weekend trip to see a show (yes I know she needs a negative test to enter) and the new York botanical garden—it appears she can go into places that are to go food—like a bakery?? Are most shops ok with kids under 12 going in, masked of course, with a vaccinated parent? Our favorite thing to do in nyc is stroll around and pop\\nInto cute shops. Thanks Vaccine mandate is more for restaurants, bars, indoor events etc. Not for shops or takeout locations. Masks may be required but for simply walking into a store proof of vaccine isn\\'t required. Trying to remember the name of a tiny mac and cheese restaurant. They only serve mac and cheese and they serve it in macaroni shaped bowls. The shop sign is a big yellow piece of macaroni if it\\'s s\\'mac as noted above, I will tell you that it\\'s novel and a cool idea but I didn\\'t think their mac n cheese was that great. It\\'s certainly decent, don\\'t get me wrong!!! but if you are looking for superb gourmet fare I did not think it was up to par. I have not been for about 4 years so it might have uppped its game since then. The place you\\'re referring to is Macbar, on prince street. Unfortunately, I believe it closed last year. If you want another good option for Mac n cheese that also provides good views, check out Merchant River House https://www.merchantsriverhouse.com/menus/#lunch-and-dinner Ha, having Mac and Cheese for lunch.\\nHad great Mac and Cheese, with lobster, at Red Rooster in Harlem one visit. I still dream about it. Some may not know what it is but if you know and love it like I do maybe you can recommend the best in NY Don\\'t come to NYC in search of mole. Most of it is not particularly great and often tastes like it comes from a bottle. The one place I really loved the mole at closed a long time ago. Probably the best at this time is Claro.It has a Michelin star if things like that matter to you. But the food is fabulous and so is the setting. Which type do you prefer?\\nFor Puebla try https://www.henrinyc.com/casa-enrique Funny response Sloppy. I have always thought of NY as the place you can get anything! psblin, when it comes to food while NYC has many things it doesn\\'t have everything. Until recently the Mexican food here was not worth seeking out. Has improved a lot over the past 10 years but its more in the variety of tacos than moles. If you wanted French or Italian or sushi, sure some of the best in America is here. But if you wanted Chinese or Korean or frankly anything from the larger Asia Pacific region, go to the left coast. Much better Mexican there too. Frankly, these days the dining scene in LA is a lot more interesting than NYC. NYC only relatively recently reached the population level where Mexican immigrants transition into entrepreneurs\\nhttps://sum.cuny.edu/combatting-the-erasure-of-mexican-immigrants-in-new-york-city/ There are many regional styles of cooking in Mexico and this includes mole. Puebla is the capital of mole, but there are many variants. La Morada, a Oaxacan restaurant in the south Bronx that doubles as a library and community center, is famous for its moles (multiple varieties) and well worth checking out. Fabulous food and wonderful people:\\nhttps://lamorada.nyc/\\nThe vast majority of Mexican immigrants in NYC are from Puebla state, so mole poblano is the default style. I’ve had creditable versions at various humble restaurants in Brooklyn’s Sunset Park neighborhood - but, full disclosure, it’s not my favorite dish so I rarely order it (my husband does, though, and I always sample). Tacos El Bronco and Tacos Matamoros are our two go-to destinations.\\nIf by “mole,” you’re generally interested in complexly spiced mixtures of chiles and seeds/nuts, I highly recommend pipián verde (or rojo if you can find it). I’m pretty sure Matamoros has verde on their regular menu; at El Bronco, it’s a frequent special. Thanks for the detailed response. Taqueria Nixtamal in the Market Line has good mole. Try the Birria there too while you at it. Claro\\'s mole is great\\nBut common SloppyEata. Did you have a bad meal today or something ;). Chinese, Korean, Mexican - its an embarrassment of riches these days. LA is great, been many times, but cant complain about NYC.\\nIf anything we are missing some good tex-mex Yeah, I agree with Ziggy that there’s excellent Mexican food in NYC these days. I’d also agree that we don’t have the diversity of regional styles that you find in Chicago, say (not sure about LA, haven’t spent enough time there). But it’s not uncommon for U.S. cities to have very particular regions of Mexico represented, whether because of their immigration history, as in NYC, or their proximity to the border. Tex-mex as mentioned, or Sonoran/Chihuahuan - I’m currently eating my way through SE Arizona - would be good examples. Someone coming to NYC from Tucson, where Sonoran food reigns supreme for obvious reasons, would miss a lot of their favorite dishes - but that doesn’t mean our Mexican food is bad. It’s just different. Hoping you visit New York in two weeks and go see wicked with my 10 year old—she needs a rapid pcr within 6 hours of the show—any spots close to Gershwin and/or Broadway area in general. Thanks Many places offer rapid tests with an hour for results but you are looking at $225 and more for the service.\\nI am curious as to why your daughter would need the test within 6 hours of the show? Following…we have tickets to see Aladdin with my 8 year old daughter on October 1st. But she will need either a PCR test within 72 hours OR a rapid antigen test within 6 hours of the show. Can anyone comment on the availabilty and price of a rapid antigen test in Manhattan? You can get a free PCR test from one of the LabQ mobile station, I went to the one at the corner of 6th and 57th (next to Central Park). I saw another one between Rockefeller Center and Bryant Park on 6th Avenue. They inform you that you will get the results in 36 hours, I got mine in 14. Ughhhhh ok I’ll just probably end up\\nDoing a free pcr on the way to the airport at home where it’s free and I don’t have to spend time hunting for one in nyc—we are having a short girls weekend in nyc for our bdays and definitely don’t want having to get the test done hanging over our heads. For a Broadway show, if you are not vaccinated—like my 10 year old who cannot be vaccinated-you need either a rapid test within 7 hours of the show or a pcr within 72 hours. Thanks I’m thinking of having a special night out to a play or musical and the NYC Ballet came to mind. Have you ever been to a show? Did you like it? Is the dress code formal or semi-formal or casual? You can wear whatever you want, People in the more expensive seats do dress more formally, but those in the cheaper seats its more of a mix\\n(I have not been to the Ballet, I am not a fan, but I have been to Lincoln Center and seen dance and opera there) I just checked and I have to wait to purchase tickets for December. That could be a nice evening out. I will think on it as it is also in a semi-crowded theater. Seems like fun, though. And I’ve never seen the Nutcracker ballet. While ABT\\'s Nutcracker is a classic, if you appreciate dance you might check to see if https://www.nycballet.com/ or https://www.alvinailey.org/ have anything of interest\\nSince you have wide ranging interests, you might also look at the the schedule at the Apollo https://www.apollotheaters.org/ Amateur Night is affordable fun - but not sure if it will be on when you are here @Kaye — I totally forgot about The Apollo. That would be an awesome theater to visit. I remember watching showtime at the Apollo back in the day. Kaye, you meant NYCB’s Nutcracker. 😉\\nAsking a ballet fan if they liked the NYCB is like asking a football fan if they liked going to the Giants game. If you like football, you’ll enjoy going to MetLife stadium. Do you like ballet? If you’re just curious, and have never been, The Nutcracker is a good entry ballet - the music is well known and the plot is easy to follow. The NYCB version of The Nutcracker is probably the most famous - it is quite spectacular. And of course, seeing Lincoln Center is a tourist stop on its own. If you don’t like ballet, well then, there’s your answer.\\nEdited: 11:22 am, September 19, 2021 Yes. It\\'s fun. I always go to at least one o the following, when I\\'m in town: A musical, an opera or a ballet. Sometimes I go to two of the three during a visit, depending on when I\\'m traveling, how long my stay is and what\\'s on when traveling.\\nBallet is a great experience live.\\nAnd in these pandemic times, I\\'m all for sponsoring those arts by buying ticktts for those events. I go to City Ballet a lot -- maybe 10 -20 times a year. I enjoy it a lot, as I enjoy the works of George Balanchine, their founder and pretty much the founder of ballet in US, and Jerome Robbins, another important figure in their history and in ballet, Broadway and film dance history in US. The heads of many other US ballet companies started at City Ballet -- including the recently retired or about to retire head of SF Ballet, Helgi Tomassen, and many important dancers in US studied at City Ballet\\'s school, the School of American Ballet. I mostly go to their fall, winter and spring repertory performances, but I also go to the Nut every year or two, though think it not so likely I will go this year as it tends to be very crowded, though who knows what it will be like.\\nTicket sales for their fall rep performances are off, but there are some good programs and very good casting starting this Tues. Note that this year there will be some changes in this Nut as they are doing it without the 100 or so kids from their school who are usually in it. This because kid auditions & rehearsals normally start in Sept and they thought there might be a health risk not only to kids, but also to Company staff and adult dancers. Nutcracker tix go in sale to general public next Sun, Sept 26, at I believe noon.\\nIf you don\\'t get to see it here, SF Ballet does an excellent Nut, as does American Balket Theater, which does its version for a couple weeks in Dec. at the Segerstrom Center in Orange County.\\nIf you do go, be sure to check their website for latest COVID protocols. Funny, I dropped my subscriptions to NYCB because I don’t love Balanchine! (I do miss the Joffrey ballet though!). Also, you can wear whatever you want and you will see all sorts of attire, from the very informal to all dressed up. At the Nutcracker a lot of the dressing up is done by young girls, who will pull out their best party finery for this event. I took the NYC ferry today and I realized its almost 2/3 of the Circle Line (Really only missing Yankee Stadium and the GW Bridge) for 1/10 the cost of the circle Line. For $5.50 round trip instead of $41 you can see all the East River bridges .\\nWhat you need to do is go to Wall St ferry Terminal and take the Soundview ferry. This will take you under all the east river Bridges for $2.75, it wil cost you $2.75 for the return trip for a total of $5.50. You can than transfer to the Rockaway Ferry (This will cost you $2.75 for a return trip) or walk to the Staten Island Ferry and see the Statue for Free.\\nI got some really great shots of the NYC Skyline, Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge and Wiliamsburg Bridge (I didnt go to the Bronx, only to Long Island City) I do believe the ferry is a great option for many, but there is a difference between a commuter ferry and a sightseeing ferry. Circle Line for example is narrated. For some tourists, that might not be a deal breaker, but for some, they may enjoy that.\\nIt would be interesting to know if the Circle Line, for example, sees a dip in business. Will be in NYC first weekend in October. Is there a place to see what events are planned for the weekend? Anywhere in the 5 boroughs! Thanks Kaye but i am looking more for outdoor things. Festivals, fairs etc. Thanks Howard this looks good. Also nycgo which is the official NYC tourism website. This is a pretty good list for street fairs: https://tinyurl.com/9w7v7ufw\\nAnd another: https://newyorkled.com/nyc_events_Street_Fairs/\\nOne of the best calendars for everything was the Events12 one, but they have stopped updating it during the pandemic. Somebody asked a question here recently about getting hotel room with space for a couple monitors or maybe renting workspace.\\nI got a postcard from WeWork today promoting \"WeWork On Demand\" -- workspace \"anytime, anywhere -- starting at just $29/day.\" They also offer a free trial of $29 space by going to we.co/trywework and using code FREEBOOKING (but note \"terms apply\"). Thanks for sharing this! Now there\\'s some networking in action, nice job. Friends are scheduled to land at 3:30 @ LGA (United/TermB) They will have baggage to collect. What is the soonest we should plan to pick them up at Arrivals? We plan to wait in the cell phone lot, but want to make sure we are there when they are ready. I know some airports can take 20 minutes from landing to baggage, others 45. It\\'s been so long since flying into LGA, I can\\'t remember.\\nThanks! I always try to arrive at their flight arrival time in case they get in early, but you wait longer, especially if they are delayed.\\nIf it is a domestic flight then the times you mentioned are still correct 20-40 mins to get off and get your luggage. International can be a bit longer.\\nI would just be prepared to wait in the car for a bit, listen to your favorite music, read, play a game, or something to break up the boredom. Hopefully you will get lucky and won\\'t have to wait long.\\nEdited: 4:35 pm, September 19, 2021 It’s a crapshoot…they may arrive early and then no gate will be available and the plane sits on the runway. Or they may arrive on time and the luggage takes forever. Or there are no problems and they’re early…. It’s a question of whether they wait or you do, if you time it perfectly, it’s almost a miracle. If it were me, I would shoot to arrive roughly about ten-20 minutes after their ETA.\\nEdited: 4:45 pm, September 19, 2021 You can also use the United Airlines website or LGA arrivals information\\nhttps://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/arrivals/LGA\\nand use that info to help time your arrival. That said, I too try to arrive at approximately the scheduled arrival time. NYC has been ranked the safest city in the US and 11th safest city in the world for 2021. Copenhagen was number one and Toronto was the runner-up.\\nhttps://www.cnn.com/travel/article/the-worlds-safest-city-2021-revealed/index.html Saw that! I visit NYC fairly often and have never felt unsafe. Good to have that article for people to reference. Glad to hear! Surprised Singapore got overtaken Thanks for sharing! I definitely feel safe living here and much moreso than my small hometown.\\nEdited: 1:12 am, September 19, 2021 \"I definitely feel safe living here and much moreso than my small hometown.\"\\nII\\'m watching only murders in the building and the quote by the steve martin character sums it up when it comes to my concern about crime:\\n\"As any true crime aficionado will tell you, it\\'s the boondocks you have to worry about,\" he explains. \"Let\\'s face it: Nobody ever discovered 19 bodies buried in the backyard of a 14-story apartment building.\" They only ranked 60 \"international destination\" cities throughout the world.\\nThe only American cities ranked (in order of safety) were:\\n1. New York City\\n2. Washington, DC\\n3. San Francisco\\n4. Los Angeles\\n5. Chicago\\n6. Dallas Great - and congratulations to one of my favorite cities on the planet!! 💕🎶🥳💕🎶🥳 It will open October 21:\\nhttps://untappedcities.com/2021/09/14/summit-observation-deck-one-vanderbilt/?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_campaign=1b3d1e1210-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_6_6_2019_11_58_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c04245c7de-1b3d1e1210-1204396905&mc_cid=1b3d1e1210&mc_eid=ae707c10e Looks amazing! Thx for sharing this Wow, that\\'s going to give the Edge and OWO a run for their money with all those bells and whistles.\\nIt\\'s extra for a sunset time slot but prices seems reasonable considering the other observation decks in the city. The typical 6-story apartment building elevator goes 100 feet per min. The ones here go 1,000 feet in just 42 seconds. I do not think my ears would ever reopen after that trip. I am really looking forward to it. Empire State Building recently renovated its deck and it looks stunning.\\nSoon NYC will have 5 observation decks, each unique in its own right, and all are just stunningly world-class experiences ( yet to check out One Vanderbilt\\'s, but i am sure it will be awesome.) The interesting thing about One Vanderbilt (aside from the whole place looking trippy as all get out) is that they\\'ve got something of a dress code- certain types of footwear are banned (stiletto heels and steel toed boots), because they could mess up the mirrored floors. They are also warning people who wear dresses or skirts, suggesting pants or leggings instead. Somebody on a Skyscraper forum said that they might end up with people doing the exact opposite, on purpose. I wonder how many people are going to get caught unawares by the dress code, because they didn\\'t read the warnings on the website before buying tickets?\\nIn any case, I want to visit sooo badly!\\nEdited: 2:36 pm, September 18, 2021 This is wild! Talk about a sensory overload. I am not sure I could handle it, but I might try. I would love to see how different atmospheric conditions play out. (What is clear vs. cloudy like? What about snowy?) And also the different times of day. Very, very wow. 😳 The Met Museum once had a summer roof exhibit with a series of elevated plastic platforms one could climb to. They quickly had to warn women of possible voyeurs lurking underneath. From Pennsylvania, I can rent a car for approx the same price as the JFK Long Term Parking. (with the exception of tolls).Total approx $200.00. Are there pros and cons to consider that would make one a better decison? (using terminal 5 and driving in on a Wednesday afternoon and returning on a 4th of July AM)...Thanks Hard to believe you could accurately price a rental almost a year in advance. Will the rental place on the PA end be open on July 4 or did you add an extra day,s rental? Yes.. it is already reserved through Costco.. I have all car rentals already reserved for the June vacation (9 mos away )\\nEdited: 2:02 pm, September 06, 2021 What car rental co. does Costco use? Just curious. My only other question would be how far is the PA rental place from your home and does that create and extra logistical problem? None of the car rental cos. at JFK are on airport grounds and that will take some time, but so will collecting your car. Are you saying two car rentals, one PA to JFK, another JFK to PA?\\nI suppose you already know that you want to fly out of JFK, let\\'s say for a flight to Europe? Crossing two rivers (I mean Hudson and East, the Delaware isn\\'t that hard to cross, as long as you stay away from Philadelphia) on a holiday week is a likely nightmare. Can you possibly fly out of EWR? I avoid JFK as much as I can. I also use off-airport parking companies, but it\\'s still pricey. #3..Costco in this case gave me 4 choices and the lowest this rental was Budget. Logistically the rental is from home is not far, but I was unsure logistically it is worth it at JFK.\\n#4..Yes..correct...One rental to JFK, then another at the end of the trip to PA...and I 100% agree about JFK.. It unfortunately has the non stop flight to Oahu unlike the preferred EWR. EWR is a way better choice. That is what I was wondering about is if the car rental companies are offsight. the question is not really clear...\\nare you trying to decide if it\\'s better to rent a car from PA and return it at JFK, fly out and then do a rental once you return to JFK to get back to PA vs. driving your own car from PA and parking at JFK for the duration of your trip? #6...yes! since the cost is the same! Sorry if my wording is confusing!\\nEdited: 5:33 pm, September 06, 2021 hopefully someone knows the hassle factor of accessing the rental car location vs. long-term parking. my suspicion is they are equally annoying. might also depend how nice your car is if you\\'d want to leave it outside at JFK - or if you want to put those extra miles on your car. sorry I don\\'t have specific info for you. Can you park in a hotel lot near the airport? In my area, there is tons of off-lot parking near the airport that is cheaper than longterm parking. Some hotels even allow longterm parking. #8...yessss that is what I was asking is the \"hassle factor of LTP at JFK vs the car rental. They could be equally annoying and yes we do have a nice car which is one of our concerns. We are in Central PA so it is a long drive from JFK after a red eye...so should be great, lol\\n#9 We are staying at TWA since it is located at Terminal 5\\nEdited: 9:36 am, September 07, 2021 Do I need to show the card or will a picture of it in my phone do? Here in Florida we don\\'t have electronic web sites to display it. “ For proof of vaccination, you can use:\\nCDC Vaccination Card. A photo or photocopy of this card is also acceptable.” I plan to bring a photocopy of my vax card and my id together. I also have a QR pic of my vaccine record. I’m going to buy a couple of lanyards to keep my vaccine card on. I have a shrunken photo copy that is laminated. It is the size of a credit card. Would that work? Look at the photocopy of the card. Can you read all if the filled in areas without a magnifying glass? If so, I would imagine you are good to go. Get it on your phone on the NYC COVID app. That way it will be very recognizable to whoever is checking and can be easily enlarged to read. Photocopies of CDC cards are also accepted, but I would also get it on your phone as that NYC COVID pass.\\nI believe someone already posted a link to the NYC web page where you can download the NYC app. You should also read the info there on the vax proof rules, where it is required, what forms of proof are acceptable, what you can do if you believe you are discriminated against,etc. I will be in New York for work for a week this month (September 2021), staying in midtown near Central Park (W. 57th). I’m hoping to make the most of my time even though I’ll be working during the day. I travel solo a lot and am from the San Francisco area, so I am comfortable being out and about in a city, but I don’t really know my way around New York. I am fully vaccinated and will have my vaccination card with me to meet all regulations and protocols.My questions are\\n1. Has anyone been to The Iguana (W. 54th) on a Monday or Tuesday for Vince Giordano’s Nighthawks? Would you recommend it (for the music)?\\n2. If I had to choose between Birdland (not as close to hotel) and The Iguana, which would you recommend? Would Birdland be worth the extra travel (vs walking)?\\n3. I am considering doing Big Apple Jazz’s Harlem Juke Joint Tour to join a small group one evening to listen to jazz in Harlem. Would it be “safe” to take the subway to the meetup point (from midtown to Harlem) at 6-7pm for a woman by herself? It seems like it should be fine at that time, but I don’t know that route/area. If any other visitors have done this tour, I would love to hear your feedback.\\nI’m also open to other recommendations if there are any “don’t miss” venues for live music. Thank you for sharing your local knowledge! 1) Vince Giordano,s Nighthawks are great. I\\'ve not been to see them at Iguana though. I think they used to be at Iridium which is currently closed. (Reopening late Oct.)\\n2) depends on who,s playing. I’d go to both if you’re a jazz fan. Don\\'t know where on w 57 st. You,re staying but Birdland is not that far a walk. Check google maps.\\n3) Harlem is a big area. Where is the meet up?\\nDizzy,s Coca Cola/Jazz at Lincoln Center is near where you’re staying if they’re open. Also, you should see who,s playing in the clubs in Greenwich Village...they,re struggling and need support.\\nEdited: 11:31 pm, September 08, 2021 Thank you for the great info nywhiz! You’re right, it’s only about a mile to Birdman, so easily walkable. I don’t know where the meeting location is for the Harlem jazz tour. I think it varies depending on what will be open. I’ll reach out to them to get more information to help me decide. Thanks for the other tips too! The big band at Birdland plays every Friday at 5. It,s fantastic if you can make it. I checked and Dizzy\\'s is open. The venue itself is great with lovely views. It,s a great experience and the food is pretty good there too, something not true for many of the jazz venues. I’d be very comfortable there alone. I\\'ll just warn if you sit at the bar, the seats would have your back to the performers but there are bar stools along the back wall which you can turn to face the front.\\nIn Greenwich Village, Small\\'s and Village Vanguard are iconic. The Bill. Charlap trio are playing the Vanguard for 2 weeks starting Sept. 21. If you’re here then, go! Thank you! That is the week I’ll be there so I got tickets to Bill Charlap! I’m not sure I’ll be able to make it for the Big Band (darn work!), but I’m going to try. Thanks for the great tips! I happened to look at Vince Giordano\\'s website recently after seeing him play (not with the Nighthawks). According to his website, beginning September 20 he and the Nighthawks will be playing Monday and Tuesday nights downstairs at Bond45, not at the Iguana. That\\'s also on the Bond45 website, which notes that September 20 is sold out.\\nhttps://vincegiordano.com/shows\\nhttps://www.bond45ny.com/ Thank you for that update! I’ll see if I can get reservations for the 21st! Please post back with your reviews. Hope you have a great time. A friend recently recommended the Classic Harbor Line architectural tour around Manhattan. Seems like a great tour, but they don\\'t allow below age 14. My youngest is 13. The company recommends Statue & Skyline as an alternative but that seems like a pretty poor substitute (described as light narration and lower Manhattan only). All of us are very interested in history and photography, and since it\\'s the kids\\' first time visiting NYC I want them to get a good perspective of the city.\\nWe\\'ve done the architectural and historic boat tours in Chicago even when my kids were younger and they loved it, so finding something similar would be ideal. The Circle Line tour seems like an option but I keep reading how some guides are great and others so-so, which is the risk with every tour of course. Evening cruise isn\\'t possible because of shows and dinner reservations each night. Any suggestions beyond these two? Ive only been on it once, but I think you should go on the Circle line, It should be interesting enough for a tween Agree with Howard, Circle Line has so many options. The Architecture tour really is great. I\\'d take another CHL trip over the Circle Line tours as the guides are generally all much better and more interesting on CHL than on Circle, which I feel deals more with the Mass Market I’ve taken the Circle Line cruise a couple of times and really enjoyed it. I would phone CHL and ask if they would accept a 13 year old. It,s not that far off from 14. Some might just go ahead and book. None of the other daytime cruises will compare for what you want. I’ve done the architecture tour and it’s great however it’s a bit challenging to hear the narrator and the idea is for the passengers to talk softly if at all. The narration is interesting but dry. And it’s for most of the cruise.\\nSo I’m sure the concern is that a young person might not be able to follow those guidelines.\\nIf you think your child is sufficiently mature and disciplined you might be able to convince them to sell the ticket.\\nPs this is more scenic than the Chicago tour but not even close to as lively or interesting.\\nEdited: 5:46 pm, September 18, 2021 We did the the Complete Manhatten Island cruise with Circle Line and the narrator was fantanstic and easy to hear as he walked around the boat.

We plan on hitting up Grand Central Station first coming in from LIC, so we could just eat the dining concourse at the station or is they anywhere around we should check out? Open to suggestions. I am so sorry I missed your post I would\\'ve suggested Pershing Square Hello! We are planning a trip to the east coast in November. We are flying into JFK, getting in at around 9 PM, renting a car and then finding a hotel. We are driving to Albany the next morning. What is the safest route to take out of NYC from JFK towards Albany where there would be hotels? We really just want to get out of the city ASAP. The following weekend we will be returning the rental car and spending some time in the city but since we will have the car we want nothing to do with it. Thank you so much!! Do you mean you want a hotel by the airport and then drive to Albany in the morning? Or are you going to drive when you land and want a hotel on the way? When I drive to Albany, I figure at least 3 hours from downtown Manhattan. I would figure at least 4 from jfk, but if it were me, I would probably just do it. (I like to drive, 4 hours is nothing for me). Any chance you can fly into Newark? It would cut an hour off your trip.\\nIf you could give an idea about where you want the hotel - close to the airport or somewhere in the Catskills region, that would help. There are little hotels everywhere. Fully agree with Risa, fly into Newark if you can, so much easier. Is your arrival day/night hotel merely a place to sleep or do you have sightseeing / dinner plans?\\nYou may not want to rent a vehicle at JFK at all\\nThere are options to take Metro North commuter train from Grand Central to a town where there are car rental agencies and you can avoid driving in the city at all\\nThere was are rental places at Tarrytown & Poughkeepsie and the ride up the Hudson line is quite scenic https://new.mta.info/map/5351\\nAmtrak goes all the way to Albany\\nEdited: 12:36 pm, September 18, 2021 If you get in at 9 p.m., would you consider just staying by the airport and getting an early start in the morning?\\nYou could make your way over to west side of Manhattan, find a hotel in Yonkers or Tarrytown or if New Jersey, find a hotel in Nyack or around there.\\nMaybe take the train from the city to Albany and rent the car there instead of at the airport. You could then stay in the the city the night you arrive, the train takes between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 hours from Manhattan Agree with all the advice above. FYI renting a car from JFK is one of the most expensive options. Assuming it\\'s too late to change arrival airport, your options are\\n-stay at JFK. The TWA hotel has great history, is ON the airport grounds and has a decent restaurant. Then, either rent car in morning OR take train into Manhattan and take Metro North heading north to a town with car rental places like North White Plains (there’s a Hertz there but double check hours).\\nOR\\n- Take an Amtrak train all the way to Albany whether you do that on arrival night or following morning. If you do that, you could stay the night in Manhattan.\\nIf you’re able to change airports to Newark, car rentals there may be cheaper and tax on car rental should be cheaper in NJ. There are also car rental places in Jersey City and lots of hotels there. Whichever airport you fly into there is no need to drive into Manhattan to head north\\nFrom JFK one of the bridge crossings between Queens and the Bronx is usually best\\nOnce in Westchester county the best route varies depending on if you prefer speed or scenery\\nAssuming you\\'re coming from home, only you know if you\\'ll be tired upon arrival or still perky because it\\'s ~6 pm west coast time and you might be up for an evening activity or driving a bit I don\\'t know if its the case here, but in many other areas of the country, the airport rental agencies have the best selection and pricing, that\\'s been my experience over the decades of traveling. I live here, so while I use the local airports, I drive my own car there.\\nIt was mentioned about taking a train outside of the city, then renting a car. Yes, that\\'s an option, but it depends on the person. I know if it were me, I want to land, get in a car and go. The last thing I\\'d want to do is to navigate public transportation and then get a rental car, etc. There are 2 roads from NYC to Albany the Taconic State Parkway and the NY Thruway (i-87). The Taconic is free and there is a toll on the thruway. Personally I prefer the thruway as its straighter , wider and you can drive faster. The Taconic has these narrow lanes and this metal fence in the middle. I hate it. I can do 75-80 on the Thruway, no Problem There will be traffic whichever way you go usually the fastest way is: From JFK you can take 678 (Hutchinson pkwy) North to exit 6B (Cross County Parkway to 87) then take exit 4N on the Cross county Parkway to get on to 87 north. That being said traffic changes so it is always best to check your phone for best directions and times.\\nI will recommend trying The new TWA hotel at JFK,it is new and unique, and most other hotels around there are very lack luster.\\nI traveled to Albany for work some and there is a reason Homewood Suites by Hilton Albany is the highest rated. Most all hotels are 3-4* hotels like this one anyway, and on a decent price, They have an indoor pool a decent gym, a nice breakfast and spacious seating area with many extras. Also, the rooms are suites, and you have a Trader Joe\\'s and Whole Foods right there on Wolf Road (as well as a Shopping Mall). I would suggest staying there for your week in Albany if you have the choice.\\nHappy planning & Have fun! You should also comparison price returning the rental to a neighborhood location near your hotel when you return to NYC. When you factor in the time & expense of getting from JFK to your hotel it may be more convenient\\nThere are lots of neighborhood locations but they tend not to be open 24/7 so check that the business hours work for your planned timing Road closures will begin September 19th and end on September 30th and will mostly impact the neighborhoods surrounding the U.N., which is located at First Avenue and 42nd Street. Drivers will feel the full effects of temporarily inaccessible streets beginning Monday, September 20th, which will be in effect from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily, said NYPD Chief of Transportation Kim Royster.\\nThere will be multiple closures, detours, and checkpoints around the Midtown area,\" said Royster, adding that bicycles will also be re-routed. \"We\\'re asking the public if you have to be in that area, to take alternate routes of transportation.\"\\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/expect-gridlock-when-un-general-assembly-convenes-next-week Wonder how many tourists will be impacted? The traffic closures will likely not impact tourists unless they are trying to drive in midtown which they are usually advised not to attempt or trying to take uber/taxis where the route would normally pass through the frozen zones. The general assembly in general could result in restaurant reservations being tougher to come by and an increase in hotel prices. Travelling by foot during the years where I worked in midtown the general assembly did not have a major impact. Like maybe once pedestrian traffic was frozen because the president\\'s motorcade had selected the blocks I was on as a possible route. The secret service snipers went by to setup in their positions and after a couple of minutes people were able to continue on. Beyond that the only thing I would notice is groups from diplomatic delegations hanging out along with a ton of motorcades etc.\\nThe size of the delegations will probably be reduced this year although there is significant concern with the 1000s of diplomats coming in that the UN could turn into a giant super spreader event for NYC.\\nI do need to drive during this period so does anyone know with these road closures how the FDR north of midtown gets impacted? Like when people drive into Manhattan via the Bronx is most of the traffic still heading down the FDR and then cutting across Manhattan on the side streets of the UES or does most traffic reroute across to the west side highway? I never paid attention to the traffic impact in the past years but I could see the UES being turned into parking lot with the middle portion of the FDR shutdown and all the UN missions that are located around the UES. Anyone have experience driving this area during general assemblies? There will be no street dining on 2d Av in 40s and 50s. In the link I posted earlier they listed the many streets outside the immediate UN area -- like on the west side or Upper East Side -- where there will be closings from time to time, most likely because VIPS are staying in hotels near there or conferences or parties are going on near there. I don\\'t see many streets on the UES being closed to traffic. A few blocks on the very southern portion that borders midtown. I believe anything down to about 60th St is considered UES by police and media. That shooting at the Philippe Chow restaurant on E 60th the other night was described as \"shooting at Upper East Side restaurant.\" I don\\'t know how that originated -- whether with police or media, but was described on TV news as UES. Perhaps this has something to do with the way police precincts are set up. I\\'m not sure, but I don\\'t believe east midtown precinct (17th) goes as far north as 60th St. Maybe that is covered by UES precinct (19th). I believe I have actually heard on TV things that happened in E50s, 58th or 59th, as being on UES, which I assumed was because they were perhaps not being reported by 17th Pct, but by 19th.\\nIn the olden days there were only two sides -- west side and east side -- no uppers, lowers or anything in between!\\nEdited: 12:11 am, September 19, 2021 https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/patrol/precincts/19th-precinct.page\\nThe 19th precinct covers that area and they describe themselves on the city website as \"serving the Upper East Side community.\" Maybe you should send them a letter and tell them they are misdescribing the hood. My precinct literally spelled incorrectly the name of one of the neighborhoods it allegedly serves on the front of the precinct station! After I repeatedly took photos and complained on Twitter and in person, they finally repainted. But it is still not spelled correctly on their web page.\\nEdited: 12:27 am, September 19, 2021 Like I said the road closures are only a few blocks on the very southern portion of the UES not many. South of 59th street is most certainly not the UES. Here is Grandrue\\'s thread on the topic https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13676210-Gridlock_Alert_Days-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nAs mentioned, the article linked lists a number of streets in other areas that will have security restrictions\\n#2 - Red - I wish I knew the answer to your driving question but I don\\'t. Depending on the direction you are headed I\\'d be inclined to use one of the more southern river crossings and go via Brooklyn & Queens or NJ.\\nEven if more miles might be less stressful Trying to decide if my schedule allows for a show. We\\'ll be arriving to LGA on Dec. 26 at 2:00pm; hotel is the Manhattan at Times Square. Is it foolhardy to plan on an 8:00pm show?\\nWe will probably be traveling carry-on only, but *may* need to check a bag; relying on uber/cab from airport to hotel, and either uber or walking from hotel to theatre.\\nIn a perfect world, we\\'d have time to get checked in, relax for a bit before changing, and then have dinner before the show, but I\\'m not certain how realistic all that is before 8:00 (or about 7:30ish really.)\\nTIA for any insight! Honestly, it\\'s not a question of timing it\\'s a question of knowing that nothing will go wrong. I once left Montreal on a Thursday, there was a problem with the airplane, so instead of leaving at 7am it left around noon. I had a show at 8pm so I made it, but it\\'s never a good idea to have a show on arrival day, just in care there is a delay somewhere on your itinerary. I think you have enough time, BUT I wouldn\\'t buy non-refundable theater tickets, just in case something goes awry.\\nI\\'d go to TKTS or the box office after arrival. Yeah, any timed event on the day of travel would never be my first choice, but it\\'s a short trip, and as things stand, that\\'s the only possible date we could squeeze it in.\\nThanks to both of you for your thoughts.\\nEdited: 4:40 pm, September 17, 2021 Practically all Broadway tickets being sold now are refundable. If something goes wrong that morning and you know you won\\'t make it, you can cancel. I\\'m not sure how close to show time you can cancel if you are cutting it close so want to see if you can make it. Thanks, MeeMee. They are being pretty flexible--unlike the ones I purchased way back in 2019 for a planned trip in \\'20; those tix were only exchangeable for another performance date. But, using those tix is what\\'s getting me a short trip this year, so it\\'s still a win! But, anyway, they\\'re only refundable up to 48 hours before curtain, so no good for travel interruptions.\\nSo it sounds like I\\'ve technically got time to make it work; I just need to decide if I\\'m comfortable rolling the dice and tempting fate. lol.\\nThanks for the info, all! Dec. 26 is a Sunday. On a normal week, many shows don,t have an evening performance on Sunday, Here\\'s a list I found. Not many evening options.\\nhttps://www.newyorkcitytheatre.com/category_dates.php?year=2021&month=9&day=26 What’s your tolerance for risk?\\nI have a friend who lives in Atlanta. She said she was perfectly fine w Sunday matinee tickets at 2:00 when she was flying in that morning. I think her planned landing was around 11:30. It all worked out. She thought I was bananas for even considering it an issue.\\nCheck your flight’s on time performance, and go from there. Whiz, because many shows (perhaps half) won\\'t play on December 25, they\\'ll add a show on December 26 so there should be lots of options.\\nEdited to add - I checked the site you linked specifically for December 26, there are lots of shows playing with start times ranging from 6:30 to 8:00.\\nEdited: 8:37 pm, September 17, 2021 Really? Most looked like 6:30 or 7. Regarding Broadway cancellations: when I read the refund policy it seemed that the acceptable reasons focused on Covid or illness rather than other things. But I guess if they aren\\'t requiring proof of the reason people can just say they are ill? Are they truly being that flexible? I\\'m trying to decide if to buy tickets to the musical I want to see, but there\\'s a chance my trip might not happen at the last minute. That\\'s not an issue for flights or hotel, but things like Broadway tickets would be affected if the cancellation policy is not truly flexible. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

If this is a barrier for you to enjoy your vacation, please consider a different destination.\\nThe mandate can be reviewed here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page I have a lot of questions, I know, and appreciate all the advice thus far. We are planning a trip for next month and are staying Midtown. We will fly in 10/7 and out 10/13. We would like to take in a Broadway musical (no must-see in particular, but want to spend <$150 on ticket), visit Ellis/Liberty islands, go to top of One World (or Rock or Empire), explore Central Park, and visit Museum of Natural History. We are very interested in historical sites and museums. Although we aren\\'t foodies, I\\'d love to show my spouse a decent pastrami on rye and NY-style pizza. Others gave some excellent ideas for free stuff to do; we like to rove and people watch and don\\'t want to be overly scheduled.\\nI read that using the NY City Pass is difficult during COVID because of the timed entry requirements for many of the sites. Is that true?\\nI also read that backpacks aren\\'t allowed \"inside the monument\" for Ellis/Liberty? Is that referring to going inside the Statue of Liberty? Is that typically part of the tour, or is that extra? Is it worth it? I just can\\'t imagine having to hang on to a rain jacket and/or umbrella, water bottle, purse, phone, hat etc. without losing something along the way; I\\'m a backpack person.\\nI have no clue how to time reservations, not knowing how long it will take to get from a midtown hotel to, say, The Battery.\\nWhere can we pick up the 7-Day unlimited Metro card?\\nI welcome and appreciate all your advice, thanks! The Explorer Pass allows you to choose entry times via their app after you\\'ve bought the pass apparently, take a good look to see if it will work for you (I haven\\'t used it myself):\\nhttps://gocity.com/new-york/en-us/products/explorer/how-it-works\\nNo bags are allowed inside the statue. They have lockers you can use before you enter, they cost a dollar or two. You can buy a simple Reserve ticket which gives you access to the whole of both Liberty and Ellis Islands (Including museums on both islands), but not inside the statue. You can walk around everywhere else. You will need to buy a Pedestal ticket (or Crown when they\\'re on sale) to go inside the statue (aka monument) and this is when you need to store all bags before going inside. Then pick up when you come out. I think even jackets, umbrellas, purses etc need to be lockered as well. Just a phone and water is all you can take, that used to be the rules anyway.\\nAllow half an hour on the subway from Midtown then a 10 minute walk to the ferry queue. That should give you enough time. Or maybe plan extra time so you can look around Battery Park beforehand, or even see the 9/11 Memorial and walk down from there (15 min walk to the SOL ferry).\\nFor pastrami sandwiches, most people want to stay in Manhattan, so you\\'ve probably heard of Katz\\'s, 2nd Ave Deli etc. These are good and easiest to get to.\\nThe 7 Day Unlimited can be bought at any subway station. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page\\nWhen I saw NY City pass in your subject line, I mistakenly thought you meant the NYC COVID Safe app. However, I suggest you download this app and upload photos of your CDC vaccination cards to it so you can just show it on your phone anywhere you have to show vax proof. Anyone can use it; you don\\'t have to live here and it doesn\\'t ask for much info other than your name. It\\'s a bright color and when people see it they seem to just accept it without spending a huge amount of time going over it. At least that has been my experience.\\nEdited: 11:21 pm, September 18, 2021 https://pix11.com/news/local-news/manhattan/nyc-traffic-un-general-assembly-2021-road-closures-to-know/\\nGridlock alert days Sept 20 - 24 and Sept 27 on account of UN General Assembly. Several streets near UN between 1st and 2nd closed to vehicles and ID required for pedestrians. No outdoor street dining on several blocks of 2d in 40s and 50s. Be prepared for traffic jams all around town as VIPs move around, to and from UN, to parties, etc. Spending christmas in NYC this year and want to know the must do\\'s while there.

Most things should be same this year but double check anything that interests you, there have been changes over the last 18 months. Unless you are one of the exceptions, it is unclear when visitors from your country will be allowed into the US\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html\\nI would not make any bookings that are not fully refundable *upon your request* - not at the option of the vendor - in case you cannot come (or prefer not to come if we have a bad virus surge) Does anyone know if Nougatine still offers a prix fixe lunch on weekdays? Their current website shows a la carte menus and also mentions a tasting menu for two at $298.00 but that could be for dinner (their lunch and dinner are under one tab), nothing is mentioned about a prix fixe lunch.\\nhttps://www.jean-georgesrestaurant.com/nougatine-and-terrace-at-jean-georges/menus/dinner/\\nIf you\\'re able to ring them you could confirm their current arrangements. Or even email them if you can\\'t ring:\\nhttps://www.jean-georges.com/contact\\nNote, if you do go, try and get a table near the big windows, you have a very nice view out to Columbus Circle and Central Park. Does anyone know what time Jimmy Kimmel starts taping? I just got an email invite to attend, it says 3:45. If that is the actual start time , perfect! If it is the arrival time it may interfere with getting to the Yankees game at 7pm. I would like to do both, but don\\'t want to accept the tickets if I can\\'t go any deny someone else the seats. They don\\'t give me specific information until I hit the accept tickets button. Your help is much appreciated. Thanks Jimmy Kimmel NYC ??? Jimmy’s show is in Los Angeles. However, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers are filmed in NYC. Jimmy Fallon tapes in New York City.\\nMaybe the OP has his Jimmys mixed up lol. Everyone here has been so helpful, both for our 2019 trip and deciding on a hotel for our October trip. I’d love your thoughts on our potential itinerary and also your favorite restaurants in the areas we’ll be visiting!\\nBackground- trip is October 23-25 (Sat-Mon). Just my 17 yo daughter and I, part of a multi-city college tours trip. We’ll be touring NYU and Fordham. We are staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square/Central. In 2019, we did the following: Central Park, St. Patrick’s, Top of the Rock, Times Square, a double decker bus night tour, 9/11 Memorial and Museum, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. We did NOT get to the Brooklyn Bridge (other than on the bus) and the High Line due to oppressive heat and just having to scale back- 108 heat index! So those are both must-dos this time. DD is not into theater so we won’t be doing Broadway this time either. Maybe next trip?\\nHere’s what I have so far:\\nSaturday—-Arrive in city about 6:30. We’ll be driving from Boston to Weehawken and taking the ferry from Port Imperial, then free bus to hotel. Definitely no timed plans this night as arrival time is only approximate. Thinking dinner and wandering around Times Square, some shopping. DD must go to the American Eagle, which we did last time, but now she works for Aerie and it’s a must-do lol. Any restaurant recommendations in/near Times Square for dinner?\\nSunday- thinking morning in Central Park with breakfast or brunch up that way or near the hotel. We’re not fancy and like pancakes, waffles. We don’t eat breakfast out often at all so just the simple stuff is a treat. Any favorites in that area? We want to see Central Park in the fall, we’ll just wander.\\nThen, subway to Kleinfeld Bridal. This is another of DD’s must do’s. She knows we’ll only see the storefront.\\nNext we’d like to go over to the High Line/Hudson Yards/Chelsea Market. Is this close enough to walk from Kleinfeld’s? Any must-sees in this area? Not planning a lunch, we’ll just grab a snack if hungry.\\nNext I was thinking the Brooklyn Bridge. Looks like the A train is the way to go over to DUMBO? We can wander around there and then hope to walk the bridge around sunset (6 pm then).\\nHeaded downtown after that. Walk through Wall St. I know it will be quiet but we’d like to see Fearless Girl and Charging Bull. Probably ready for dinner and I’m thinking Stone St. Favorites there?\\nThen I thought we’d do the Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue at night. We only saw it in daytime last trip.\\nFinally, I thought we’d head to Max Brenner to wrap up the night. Looks like the 4 train to the restaurant and then R back to the hotel?\\nMonday- we have a 10 am tour at NYU. We will probably get an early start, leaving our luggage with the hotel. Just grab a quick breakfast like coffee and bagels. Hoping to spend a little time in Bryant Park and then take the D train to NYU. Tour is 10 am to 11 am and maybe we can spend a little time in the area/Washington Square Park after. Our Fordham tour is at 2. It looks quickest to take the 6 train up to Grand Central and then the Metro North to Fordham. Hoping to have time to grab a quick lunch in the Bronx before the tour. After the tour, we may explore the area a little bit. Then Metro North back to Grand Central, pick up our bags at the hotel and then free bus back to the ferry. We’ll be driving to Philly from there.\\nI should add that I walk 3-4 miles daily here at home and DD is a multi-sport athlete. We can walk a lot, especially since it’s not likely to be blazing hot. We’ve been doing City/college tours and over 30K steps this summer. So I know our plan has a lot of walking but I think we can handle it. We’re also flexible and will adjust if needed.\\nSo thanks in advance for any thoughts and suggestions! Would especially appreciate if there’s anything possibly unsafe for 2 women in my plan. I assume the Staten Island ferry and the downtown area is ok at night?\\nThanks! Forgot to add the type of food we like for dinners. Italian, Mexican, basic American, Cajun/Creole are our favorites. DD is not super adventurous and doesn’t love pizza but tolerates it. We did the NY slice last time so she’s requested no pizza this time. Sunday breakfast: If you decide you want something a little more special, take a look at Norma\\'s, it\\'s really great. I happened to walk by Kleinfeld\\'s a few days ago. There was a dress in the window that was so spectacular I actually took a photo of it. The designer was Pnina Tornai. It\\'s not a big windowfront - it will take under ten minutes to take all of the photos you want to take. And yes, totally walkable to your next stops. Your daughter sounds like she loves fashion, you may want to spend some time in the Meatpacking District, lots of stores she would like (start on 14th and Ninth Av, head west, continue south on Ninth across from the Gansevoort, and cut west on any of the other streets, it\\'s all stores she would love. But fair warning, if you do that, you will never make it to the Brooklyn Bridge. Actually, you may have way too much here... going to the Brooklyn Bridge AND Wall St area after Central Park and the High Line, and then downtown is a LOT. And then the SI Ferry? WOW. I live 5 minutes from Stone St...it\\'s busy here at night...the dog walkers rendezvous outside the Stock Exchange around 11 every night...and there\\'s usually still some tourists, not to mention people like me straggling home. On Stone St, I like Adrienne\\'s Pizza. There are a LOT of new restaurants in the Seaport area, instead of Max Brenner, maybe just wander over to Big Gay Ice Cream or Van Leeuwen, both on Front St, both open until midnight. I\\'m thinking that you may want to skip the Ferry if you do make it across the Brooklyn Bridge. Instead, maybe swap out eating on Stone St and instead it at The View, it\\'s right next to where the SI Ferry leaves from, and has views of the SoL. You can walk through Battery Park if you want (and see the Seaglass Carousel). It\\'s not the amount of walking on leery of on this day, it\\'s that you\\'re rushing through places that don\\'t really allow you to rush, they take time.\\nBryant Park is not huge - get your breakfast from a vendor there and eat on a bench. You\\'re on a tight schedule between 11 and 2 to get up to the Bronx after your NYU tour. Have you checked out the timing? I wouldn\\'t spend more than a half hour in Washington Square Park if you plan to eat lunch before your tour. I would throw some granola or protein bars in your bags just in case you don\\'t really have enough time. I was writing my post and didn\\'t see your second post. Adrienne\\'s pizza is a real restaurant - it also has plenty of pasta options. Otherwise, check out Mad Dog and Beans near Stone St, or Tacombi on Broad St ( same street as Fearless Gril and the Stock Exchange). Alternatively, if you like tacos, check out El Luchador on South St.close to the Seaport, or Cowgirl Seahorse on Front St for Mexican. For dinner when you arrive, Toloache, Tacuba and Hells Kitchen are all good Mexican places north and/or northwest of your hotel, about 15 min. walk. But keep in mind, places in the area will be busy with the pre-theater crowd but will thin out at 7:30 when they leave for theater. If it weren’t for your desire to shop in Times Square I\\'d say go to another area for dinner. Soho is more fun and there’s an American Eagle there but it closes at 8 whereas the one in TS closes at 9.\\nI agree with Risa that your Sunday plans are overly ambitious. I would eliminate some things or try doing them Sat. Night. You could do the High Line, Hudson Yards, and Chelsea Market and eat in that area. So many good places. Your hotel is close to American Eagle so you can pop in there any time.\\nNorma\\'s is a good idea for Sunday breakfast but pre pandemic you would have needed a reservation I think and,prices are high (so are portion sizes). The Boat House IN Central Park is one of my favorite places for breakfast/brunch but it,s also on the pricey side, but the setting is divine. Le Pain Quotidien also has a location in the park. Here,s a link with info on all the eating options in the park.\\nhttps://www.centralpark.com/visitor-info/food-and-drink/restaurants-in-central-park/\\nAnother idea is to grab a coffee and something at Bibble & Sip on the way to the park and save yourselves for a later brunch because you will want to sit and rest with your plans.\\nOne thing to know, there,s a new Staten Island ferry from midtown leaving from where you\\'re arriving. It stops at Wall St. first.\\nhttps://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/st-george/\\nEdited: 10:14 am, September 18, 2021 I wouldn’t, dawdle in midtown on Monday morning. I\\'d head directly to the village and get something to eat in or around Washington Square Park. In fact, if she’s serious about either of the NYC schools, you might consider spending some of your time on Sunday in the locations of the 2 schools rather than focusing on sightseeing. Just a thought. Thank you both! I am definitely checking out all those restaurant recommendations.\\nEven as I typed all that, I was worried Sunday has too much. I think we might drop the ferry. Or at least play it by ear with a very likely expectation we won’t get to it or feel up to it. Wall Street isn’t a must either.\\nNywhiz- I definitely think we’ll switch to more time in Washington Square Park/NYU area Monday morning including grabbing breakfast. Maybe just walk through Bryant Park to Grand Central Monday morning to get the subway.\\nI’m leery of planning anything Saturday night that’s not really close to our hotel. We tour Boston College and Northeastern that morning, then the drive down. I’m thinking we’ll be tired and it will be an early night.\\nI wish we had more time to spend in all these cities. Unfortunately many of the schools only reopened for tours recently and now she’s back in school and can’t miss too much time. She’s on the school golf team too so September has been out of the picture. Trying to at least get a peek before she applies but can definitely make another trip back to any she ends up seriously considering after acceptances before the final decision has to be made. I agree that going straight to Washington square park is a better idea on Monday morning. Of all the things that tourists say they want to do, I have never understood this obsession w Bryant Park (except for maybe the holiday market). It’s an urban oasis for busy New Yorkers to grab a coffee and rest on a bench or chair. But it’s nothing much to see. It’s a half block long and a street block wide. No big deal.\\nWashington square park has a beautiful arch line the Arc D’ Triomphe, has a storied history, and a beautiful fountain. And it’s basically the NYU quad. There’s a coffee place across the street on the south east side of WSP (can’t remember the name). Grab a coffee there and enjoy. Okay. I understand. So prioritize your Sunday activities. I’m not a Chelsea Market fan unless you’re going to eat in one of the places there. Central Park is really in the opposite direction to everything else. Try not to run yourselves ragged. Take time to smell the roses.😎 Coming to Manhattan in two weeks for son’s wedding. Rather than hire a shuttle to transport a small group of guests on the wedding day (complicated because of “Catholic gap” between ceremony and reception AND some people are involved in wedding pictures), I’m considering gifting everyone Uber gift cards. But now I’m hearing that Uber service is not good these days. Is that true? Can I not count on Uber for adequate transportation needs? Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!\\nEdited: 4:48 pm, September 17, 2021 It’s fine. It just got a lot more expensive. During rush hour, there may be numerous cancellations - that’s probably what you’re heard about. But rush hour is bad in every way. How many people?\\nWhere will you be going to/from?\\nYou can use the Uber app at any time to see availability.\\nSo if you’ll be looking for trips from A to B on a Saturday at 4:00 pm, use the app tomorrow at 4:00 pm to at least get a general idea. Agree and understand about rush hour — just checked and it’s $17 from Midtown hotel to UES church. Very doable, and coincidentally about the same time we would be traveling three weeks from tonight.\\nDay of wedding — a Saturday afternoon — route is Midtown Hotel to UES church to Tavern on the Green then back to hotel, obviously. It’s the church to Tavern leg than I’m fretting about. No easy subway ride for that, and these people could never handle a bus. Have you thought about getting a limo maybe? Or maybe hire a mini-bus? Just some thoughts. Yes, thanks everyone! I appreciate the feedback. Saturday afternoon is an easier time to navigate. You should be ok. Cross it off the list of things to stress about. Uber is always available just insanely expensive compared to the good old days (pre-COVID). Sometimes cabs are cheaper. You can use the Curbed app for those if you prefer not to just hail off the street. Also try Via. They now have carpooling but only allow 2 people in the car at a time, so if you are a couple you\\'d have the Via to yourselves and it\\'s almost always less than Uber/Lyft. But even by yourself, I take it a lot and usually have it all to myself. Once recently there was another person in the back seat but if you\\'ve been on a plane with tons of people, why worry about just 1 person in the back seat with you? Open the window. Only thing with Via is you typically have to walk a half a block or so to get the car (which I\\'m fine with given the $ savings), it doesn\\'t pick up or drop off at the door of your destination. Masks are required in Uber, Via, Lyft for driver and all passengers. Don\\'t laugh, but we folks from small islands tend to shop for ordinary things when we travel to the USA. For example, Target is usually my first stop! I like department stores like JC Penney and individual stores like Loft and New York & Company. Macy\\'s can be a bit pricy unless there are good sales. I have already noted where those stores are in Manhattan. Sometimes I can handle Marshall\\'s, if it\\'s not too confused (not that fond of pawing through long racks). I usually have a lot of luck at Kohl\\'s, but don\\'t see any in Manhattan.\\nWhere else do women shop for business casual wear and classic staples, especially in slightly larger sizes (not juniors or teens)? I am not into designer wear particularly (I care more about what looks and fits right, and the right price, rather than whose name is on it. My office is pretty casual so I don\\'t need any polished, corporate looks. I plan to come in November, so I know there won\\'t be cute summer tops or sandals, but I\\'m hoping I can still find classic casual pants (a step up from jeans but not as formal as business slacks) and sleeveless shells (that are designed to be worn under jackets, but I won\\'t be).\\nIdeas? I am in my early 50s and carrying some extra weight, but I don\\'t dress like a grandma - I like classic with a touch of trend, if that makes any sense at all. Take a look at Uniqlo. Moderate prices and good quality for the price point. It\\'s a Japanese chain with several locations in NYC. They have both classic basics as well as clothes with a \"twist\". I think the sizes in the stores mostly only go up to XL, although they have extended sizes online. BTW, there\\'s a Kohl\\'s in Newport Centre, just across the river in Jersey City. Very easy to get to using the PATH train (separate from the NYC subway but same $2.75 fare & you can use a pay-per-ride Metrocard.) The area around Macy\\'s has some regular stores too.\\nBetween Union Square and Madison Square Park on 5th Ave there are some regular clothing stores like H&M, Banana Republic, Free People etc. There\\'s a Nordstrom Rack at the SE corner of Union Square on E14th St. There\\'s a Marshalls on 6th Ave near W18th St. If you are willing to go to Queens, Queens Mall has it all (and Target is next doot to it). Its about a 15-20 Min Subway ride from Timed Square I have not been there, but you may find that the Empire Outlets have what you’re looking for. Take the free Staten Island Ferry and walk there https://empireoutlets.nyc/\\nYou might get lucky and find some summer stuff!\\nEdited: 5:30 pm, September 15, 2021 If you\\'re willing to go to Queens there are three shopping malls along Queens Boulevard\\nThis thread is old but the subway directions are accurate and mall links should still be good\\nBe sure to check the store directories - there may have been pandemic related changes\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k11897420-Queens_shopping_centre_from_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html I took a ride on the Staten Island ferry this summer just for fun (locals do it too!) and took a look around the outlet store there and it was pretty sad. Very few stores and even fewer shoppers. There was a line for vaccinations so that was heartening. Unless someone has more recent info, or if you know there’s something there you’re interested in, I wouldn’t make a special trip. If you’re taking the ferry anyway though, you might want to look around since it’s so close. Thanks BPNYC - that’s why I always add the caveat when I haven’t been somewhere, so it’s not an endorsement, just as idea to research. I haven’t been there or Jersey Gardens, or any of the outlets centers except Woodbury, at least 3 years ago (and then only in the section with all of the designer stores because it’s fun).\\nI hesitate recommending TJ maxx or Marshall’s or those discount type places because so much stuff is damaged, and if a tourist discovers that when they get it home, they can’t return it. Very much caveat emptor. One of the mall links in the thread linked in #6 was bad\\nThis one should work https://www.regocenter.com/\\nWould you have a day to devote to an outlet run? Not recommended for most visitors but they often have past season merchandise that has been removed from the regular retail stores so you might consider it (both require bus rides)\\nJersey Gardens https://www.simon.com/mall/the-mills-at-jersey-gardens/stores\\nWoodbury Commons https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/woodbury-common There is Shopoing center in College Point Queens with a TJ Maxx and Target, however its not near the subway and clearly made for people with cars as it has a huge parking lot,There is a similar shopoing center in Canarsie Brooklyn, Again with a large parking lot and not near the Subway Hi I’m just wondering we hopefully are travelling from the uk to new York next October so we will be there for Halloween with my husband and 8 year old daughter wondering as she loved that time of year how easy would it be for her to go treat or treating as I don’t want her to miss out Just pick a neighborhood, get some costumes and something to hold the treats...and enjoy! It is hard to get into apartment buildings but you may be able to ring doorbells on some brownstones. Don\\'t be surprised if you don\\'t get many replies, though Your 8 year old daughter might like the Children\\'s Halloween Parade that starts at Washington Square Park and moves a few blocks where a small fair is set up. That\\'s what has happened prior to the pandemic anyway, hopefully they will bring it back this year. They have marching bands and the kids seem to really enjoy it. Both kids and adults get dressed up.\\nIt\\'s held in the afternoon so plenty of time later for trick or treating or even going to the big adult\\'s parade on 6th Ave.\\nThis is the website for last years Children\\'s Parade (it was virtual last year), keep an eye on it for this year. Watch the video in the article to see what it\\'s like:\\nhttps://www.nyu.edu/community/nyu-in-nyc/halloween.html Likely the Dog Parade https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/tompkins-square-halloween-dog-parade-fort-greene-great-pupkin-parade-2021-dates and Halloween parade will be on https://halloween-nyc.com/\\nIt\\'s harder to do conventional trick or treating but the novelty of those events might distract her from anything she might be missing She won’t be able to go into apartment buildings in Manhattan. This is good opportunity to explore Areas of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island where there are more private homes. Sometimes Manhattan buildings ask their residents if they are willing to have Trick or Treaters and the names of people who say yes go on a list so the Trick or Treaters know where they can go and push doorbells, but in my experience this is limited to kids who live in that particular building, not kids from outside. Actually, if the building has a doorman, anyone who tries to come in off the street will be sent away. And buildings without doormen will likely have locked front doors. I think the lack of Trick or Treating opportunities may be a reason why many Manhattan kids go to parties. You might want to check listings on a site like Time Out closer to the date to see what types of kids\\' Halloween events might be open to your family. I believe, at least in \"normal\" years, there is some early evening event up at the NY Botanical Garden for kids and families thst is held multiple times around Halloween, is very popular and sells out. Some.of the Manhattan museums and historic houses also have Halloween-related events.\\nEdited: 8:32 pm, September 17, 2021 Mommypoppins.com\\nis a good site for kids‘ activities and will have events listed. We are planning a trip to New York City, Midtown area, late October. Which airport is more convenient, LGA or JFK? We are planning on using a taxi or car service. In general if taking a taxi LGA is better since it is closer. This is assuming the taxi stand is back at the terminals. I know for a time at least you had to take a shuttle to get to the taxi stand which was a bit annoying. For taxi I\\'d go with LGA for sure as it is much cheaper to get into the city than JFK. The LGA Yellow cab dispatcher lines have been back at the terminal curbs for a while https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/by-taxi\\nIf you use a car service at LGA upon arrival you must meet them at the designated area adjacent to the terminal (no curbside pick ups) https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides\\nAs mentioned above, a Yellow cab to Manhattan, even though on-the-meter, can be less expensive than JFK\\n(Yellow cabs between JFK & Manhattan are a fixed rate that comes to a total of ~$70-75 after tip & possible tolls https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/taxi-car-and-van-service )\\nWhen deciding between the two airports flight schedules and prices are other factors to consider\\nFlights to EWR can also be an option whichever has the cheapest direct flight -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

There is no one good location except for the caveat that you want to stay near a major subway station. As for experiencing NYC in the fall, please note that the leaves don\\'t usually turn until the end of the month in the city. Even with dates, strangers can’t really give you advice with the info you provided. Some people love the excitement of the bright lights in Times Square, some hate the crowds and glitz. Do you prefer older classic hotels with big rooms or is modern more your style? Would you like a view or are you worried about heights? What,s the most important thing to you about a hotel? Are you a member of a hotel points club? Do you like to eat dinner near your hotel or will you travel at night? Describe what you would like (are amenities at the hotel more important than location?) and it will help w neighborhood.\\nManhattan in particular, if that’s where you’re planning to stay, is very accessible by public transportation. Where you stay isn’t all that important as sights are spread out all over the Borough. But your style of hotel matters…bigger rooms, more of a boutique vibe, or so you like big chains?

Not all hotels charge the added fee (what you called the convenience fee) and is usually called a resort fee. Just so you know, hotel rates change dramatically by date. The last week in Oct. can be more expensive because of Halloween, which is a big deal here.\\nHere are a few hotels of different types in the area between Times Square and Central Park, very walkable to many famous sites like Times Square, Fifth Ave, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Plaza Hotel, Tiffany’s...\\nI think it,s one of the best areas for a first visit.\\nM Social has good sized rooms, good views and good prices. Look on their own website and if you join their frequent guest program (Millenium) which is free, you get better discounts.\\nMichelangelo is an older hotel in the same area with huge rooms and huge bathrooms and feels more elegant. They do charge a resort fee.\\nThe Warwick, also an older hotel but with big rooms.\\nResidence Inn Central Park is a newer hotel, at the top of the tallest hotel building in Nkrth America. Views are great,the room rate includes breakfast and the rooms also have kitchens.\\nAnother area to consider is the financial district where you\\'d be near Wall St., the 9/11 Memorial, the Brooklyn Bridge and many ferries. Prices tend to be lower but you can still see any of the sites you want elsewhere.\\nAC Hotel Downtown is new\\nThe Artezen is also newish and well liked on the forum\\nResidence Inn a World Trade Center is another good option. PS there are not that many rooftop restaurants. Most rooftops are bars...but there are some.\\nAre you sure you can enter the US given Covid restrictions? -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

Coming to the city to catch Yankees game and take subway to game. Thanks! If pricing is an issue, The Dylan is having a limited time 20% off sale now. The Park Central requires a mandatory, daily $38 resort fee. Are you open to other options? If you offer dates and budget you could get other suggestions. Both of those hotels have subway access to Yankee Stadium. They\\'re both close to subway stations (different stations) that would get you there plus anywhere else you would like to go.\\nJust based on location though, I think I prefer Park Central. It\\'s closer to Central Park which I feel is nicer. But the Dylan is close to GCT which is also very handy.\\nBoth have very positive recent reviews.\\nThe Dylan rooms look like they have been updated over the last few years. That is a big positive for me. Thank you both for your replies. The Dylan is coming in at $40 less than Park Central. My big thing with choosing Park Central at greater cost is proximity to so many restaurants/ more nightlife.\\nThe room will be booked for this Fri 9/17 and am hoping to keep cost under $250. Park Central coming in at $280 with fees.\\nI am always open to suggestions but one thing making it tricky is my need for a king sized bed.\\nThanks again for your input! Take a look at the M Social hotel. It\\'s not far from the two you\\'ve mentioned and has a King bed.\\nIt\\'s coming in at $258.00 total if you become a member (join online and for free) for their Wonder-Fall offer. Or $285.00 if you don\\'t want to join.\\nhttps://www.millenniumhotels.com/en/new-york/m-social-hotel-times-square-new-york/ Aynat62, thank you for the recommendation! I booked the M Social hotel for tonight. Those views cannot be beat! https://gothamist.com/news/long-awaited-bike-lane-opens-brooklyn-bridge\\nOpened to the public on Tuesday, the new bike lane is on the road level, below the current shared pedestrian walkway and narrow bike lane.\\nSounds like a very good plan to me. Keep the bikes and pedestrians separate. But the new bike lane looks pretty narrow, and must allow bikes riding both ways. They are also closer to cars than before.\\nThe pedestrians are the winners and will be able to walk over a much wider area now, one level above the bikes and cars. Agree with both points. The bike lanes definitely seem a bit narrow, but i think they are the same size as regular 2-way bike lanes. It will be great for pedestrians. Looking forward to walking the bridge soon. Please report back on how it\\'s all working out. I love watching all those Youtube vidios on bicycling across the BBridge and the near-misses with pedestrians... Gonna miss the crossings without drama -) Bike lanes don\\'t look too narrow to me. I think that is just the way it appears on camera. Doesn\\'t seem to be a big deal that they are near cars give the concrete divide and fence. Maybe in the summer with exhaust fumes if there was a lot of traffic but seems fine. Cyclists and pedestrians needed to be separated. Too many tourists on foot not paying attention at all to their surroundings which resulted in accidents. Kinda disappointing that the bike lane is on the interior as opposed to the outer lane of the bridge with a better view, but I guess that is necessary otherwise you would get some people stopping on the bridge to take photos and clogging up the biking lane. Walked the bridge today and agree with Red\\'s observations. What joy it is to walk the bridge freely now without having to look for bikes.\\nEdited: 10:58 pm, September 15, 2021 I was wondering whether they took away some of the vehicle lanes to make way for the bike lane. And all it will need is some sort of vehicle pile up or a truck crash to push the barriers into the bike lane.\\nBut the pedestrians certainly have the best deal. No need to think about bikes anymore, more room to move around, they can move to the northern side of the bridge to take pictures without thinking about bikes.\\nHave they removed the white bike lane paint on the pedestrian level, ISDW? Or maybe they\\'ll just let it fade away over time. They didn\\'t expand the brooklyn bridge. The bridge had three driving lanes and they took the inner most lane on the brooklyn to manhattan side of the bridge and made that the bike lane and left two driving lanes. Don\\'t really think its likely that those barriers are going to move into the bike lane. They are concrete and linked together. Also, the bridge isn\\'t really a place where vehicles can pick up a lot of speed especially during the daytime hours when most cyclists would be out due to all the traffic and the fence is likely there to limit a vehicle\\'s ability, or at least help slow it down, to jump the barrier in a collision. Think other bike lanes are more at risk of something happening than the ones going over the bridge. Good article on the bike lane from a bicyclist\\'s perspective.\\nhttps://www.curbed.com/2021/09/brooklyn-bridge-new-protected-bike-lane.html\\n@Aynat....the markings still exist...i think they will just wash away. I didnt ride it yet, but had the exact same sentiment as this article when I first saw the pictures Very thoughtful article. Thanks for posting ISDW. Will be in NYC the week before Christmas. I like trying food from different cultures. Could I please have some recommendations for your favourite places and menu items for each cuisine that you like? Also, general recommendations for other things to do and see are welcome. It would help to know where you are from as it would help to know what is exotic to you.\\nI personally had a really good meal at Wayan, it\\'s Indonesian cuisine, I still think about the corn fritters **Also, general recommendations for other things to do and see are welcome.**\\nWhat are your plans so far?\\nWhat are your interests?\\nFirst visit to NYC? How about you tell us what cuisines you like and your budget and area you will be visiting so you don\\'t get recommendations for areas, cuisines, or prices that don\\'t work for you.\\nOr check Travel Chick\\'s posts here as I am certain she has at least one thread with this topic fully discussed I\\'m from the Caribbean and I\\'ve been to NYC a few times. The only thing I\\'ve done in the way of planning is save a few food places on Apple Maps. I can\\'t really think of anything else that truly excites me. Maybe I\\'ll discover something from your suggestions. Appreciate the Wayan suggestion, jcm. I like classic New York pizza (had Joe\\'s and a few others before), Indian, Italian, Eastern European (had peirogis and other stuff), etc. For most of the food $ to $$. One or two special meals can be $$$ or $$$$. I love the look and vibe of the place in this video:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLQeb8LWyh0\\nAny suggestions of other places with this same old school look, feel with good food? Can be any kind of food. If you like French food, I really enjoyed the salmon tartar, with fries and the cheese plate at Pastis. I realized on Tuesday night that I had been to quite a few Greek restaurants over the last 3 or 4 months, Kyma, Elea, Periyali, Avra, and even Calissa in Water Mill (it wasn\\'t a conscious effort to survey this cuisine, it kind of evolved). Milos and Molyvos shortly before the pandemic shutdown....\\nAlthough I had a great meal at all of them, hands down, the winner was Kyma. That thought wandered into my mind as I was walking home from Avra on Tuesday night - which was flawless (although service was slightly discombobulated). If you enjoy fresh seafood/Greek food, there are many choices. Kyma has risen to become my particular favorite. I haven\\'t been to Pylos in about 3 years, it was also good (and a little less expensive than the others), but it\\'s been a while so my \"review\" would be way out of date. If that\\'s your inspiration, then Pisillo Panini is not to be missed. pasillopanini.com\\nIt\\'s on Nassau St, a few blocks north of the Stock Exchange and a few blocks south of the Brooklyn Bridge entrance.\\nEdited: 4:44 pm, September 17, 2021 https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13419686-hChristmastime_in_NYC_2020_What_s_On_Dates_Updates-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHere is last year\\'s Christmas things to do list. This year\\'s will be posted in a month or two. Does it cause much sea sickness? depends on the individual and the weather that day. I\\'ve seen some nice whitecaps on the Hudson and in New York Harbor when the winds are high. The Staten Island Ferry boats are sizable ships. Other ferries are another matter. The ride to Staten Island is under 30 mins. I have horrible motion and sea sickness and had no trouble with either the NY Waterway ferry from Port Imperial to Midtown or the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island ferry. I do tend to be fine as long as a boat is moving though, it’s sitting there rocking away that I can’t handle. The only time I notice just a slight issue just beginning to start was waiting on the Statue ferry to leave at one point. I remember saying to my daughter, I hope we get going soon or I’m going to get nauseous. We did leave shortly and I was fine. Thanks everyone I appreciate the help Hello,\\nWe are traveling from Buffalo with 2 other couples to NYC for the weekend 12/3-12/5. We\\'re looking for good places to stay for 6. We are OK with getting 3 separate rooms but also see lots of Airbnbs. Are there any reputable Airbnbs that you know of? We\\'d like to be able to be out enjoying the sights and then just walking to our hotel. Right now I\\'m leaning towards ROW hotel. My husband and I stayed there when it was the Milford but that was some time ago. We are planning on the doing the usual attractions...shopping, central park, ground zero, etc.. We\\'d like to stay under $300 a night per room.\\nAlso, besides the usual attractions are there any things we should try to see/do during the holiday season. We\\'ve only been there during summers. Are there any restaurants that are super cool during Christmas that I should be trying to get reservations to now? And is it worth going to Arthur\\'s Ave for a meal during the Holidays? We always want to go there during our summer visits but have yet to make it.\\nThank you!!\\nKerri\\nThank you! **Also, besides the usual attractions are there any things we should try to see/do during the holiday season.**\\n-The various holiday markets(Union Sq/Bryant Park/etc.)\\n-The department store holiday windows.\\n-The Christmas trees around the city: Rock Center/Bloomberg LP courtyard, etc.\\n-Ice skating(Central Park, Rock Center, etc.)\\n-Shopping at local/smaller stores.\\n-Radio City Christmas show\\n-Light display at Saks\\n-Holiday light displays in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn.\\n-Shop at the flea markets/pop-up holiday spots.\\n-Train show at the Botanical Gardens.\\nJust a few options. **And is it worth going to Arthur\\'s Ave for a meal during the Holidays?**\\nSure...if you can fit it in your schedule. One of the best things to do during the holiday season, in my opinion, is to just stroll around the city. You are coming a little early in the month, but you will feel some of the post Thanksgiving/pre Xmas excitement.\\nPeople will be out shopping, enjoying the weekends and just starting to build up towards Xmas.\\nYou can....well...I can...feel it as it gets closer to Dec 25. I guess that\\'s why I am a VERY last min Xmas shopper! Thank you, I\\'m very excited to visit at Christmas!! Airbnb is pretty much totally illegal in Manhattan. You are much more likely to be scammed than to find a legal one on the island. Definitely pick a hotel that works for you https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13419686-Christmastime_in_NYC_2020_What_s_On_Dates_Updates-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHere is a list of Christmas activities from last year. It was deep in the pandemic so some things will doubtless change for this year. Check the FAQs on the right side of the page in a month or two for this year\\'s list. I am OBSESSED with Christmas and therefore one of the top things on my bucket list was Christmas in NYC, which I did in 2019. Here is a list of things we did:\\n-Rolf\\'s German Restaurant (They weren\\'t taking reservations at the time so we went right at opening and waited in line for 45 minutes - drinks were ridiculously expensive and there was a 1 drink minimum per person but it was worth it IMO)\\n-Macy\\'s on 34th St (the Salvation Army ambassadors singing and dancing outside the main entrance may have been my favourite part of the trip)\\n-St Patrick\\'s Cathedral\\n-The library on 5th Ave (the Christmas decor was magnificent!)\\n-Christmas walking tour that started in Columbus circle, took us across the park then up 5th Ave to see the windows\\n-Rockefeller Center and Saks light show\\n-The Nutcracker at the Lincoln Center (it was between this or The Rockettes)\\n-Dinner at Tavern on the Green (the decor again was top notch)\\n-Champagne at The Plaza after The Nutcracker\\n-Multiple Christmas markets scattered throughout the city\\n-Big Bus tour at night showed off a lot of the lights\\n-Walk through Central Park\\nWe stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Times Square South. It was about $150/night CAD so I\\'m sure you could find something nicer in your budget, but it was adequate.\\nWe were there from December 19-23, so I\\'m not sure how much changes in those couple weeks but I\\'m sure most will still be applicable. My friend had never been before so we did all the regular touristy things as well which were all great that time of year. A must thing to do during your trip is visiting Rockerfeller Center ice skating rink and the huge Christmas tree. It is so festive and enjoyable. Definitely a hotel and not AirBnB (mostly illegal as PP said). I am coming later in the month and there were lots of great deals on Hotels.com. I usually use that site to filter and search and then book direct with the hotel. However in this case the rate on Hotels.com was much better (I got a suite at The Benjamin for around $300/night). For many years before I lived in NYC I would visit that first weekend in December and it is a great time to go. Only downside is that the Rockefeller tree lighting usually hasn’t happened yet but the tree will be up & in the decorating process. Aside from planning what to do and where to go, It’s important to know that proof of vaccination is currently required for many things in NYC.\\nOf course, no one can predict now with any certainty what the situation will be here in December, but everyone in your group should be vaccinated and prepared to show proof to do any of the following in NYC…..\\nhttps://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/heres-a-list-of-everywhere-in-nyc-proof-of-vaccination-is-required/3267818/ Super-excited to have booked our 3rd trip to NYC, Oct 7 - 11. Would love to hear thoughts on things to do. We have done all the major attractions on our previous trips (last was 2019) and would like to have a more intimate experience of the city. We are both fully vaccinated and we\\'ll be staying midtown. We love art, museums, culture, fashion, architecture, walking & exploring neighborhoods and Broadway. So far on my list I have:\\n- Central Park for fall colors\\n- Walking through East Village, Union Square, West Village\\n- Museums: Whitney, Frick and maybe Neue. May try and fit in a trip to Brooklyn for the Christian Dior exhibit. Any other galleries and special exhibits to consider?\\n- Ferry trip midtown to Staten Island (new route)\\n- Perhaps some cool boutique shopping and/or bargain hunting for my 14 yrs old\\n- A show or two. Daughter\\'s current fascination is Greek mythology so considering Hadestown and maybe just for fun Mrs. Doubtfire or Alladin. I am personally intrigued by David Byrne\\'s Utopia but not sure if it will impress my teen :) Any other suggestions? (we have seen Hamilton, Lion King, Wicked, Moulin Rouge and Come From Away).\\nThank you all in advance! \"Daughter\\'s current fascination is Greek mythology so considering Hadestown\"\\n100% **We have done all the major attractions on our previous trips (last was 2019) **\\nI always find this hard to believe as I have lived here my entire life(save for the first 3 years) and haven\\'t done all of the major attractions.\\nSome options:\\n-https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2021/in-america\\n-Chinatown in Sunset Park, Brooklyn\\n-Essex Street Market\\n-Brooklyn Flea\\n-A walk through Bergdorf\\n-https://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/ravishing-the-rose-in-fashion.php\\n-Little Island\\n-The Edge\\n-Check out the \"characters\" at Comic Con. No need to go in. Just be in the Javits Center area. Are you driving from Toronto? It is highly unlikely that Central Park will have any fall foliage yet. You\\'re more likely to see fall foliage in Toronto than in NYC. OP can’t drive from Toronto. Into photography/NYC?\\n- https://www.timesofbill.com\\n- https://sistinechapelexhibit.com/new-york/\\nEdited: 4:11 pm, September 14, 2021 Way too early for fall colors.\\nHere is a great site for self guided walking tours, might be of interest:\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html\\nAnd yeah, I\\'m with ter, been here for my whole life, still haven\\'t seen all the major attractions. Thanks all for the suggestions! Noted that too early for fall colors. Ter - amazing suggestions - you must be a parent to a 14 y/o or are one yourself :) Had no idea comic con would fall on that weekend, daughter is in on the anime -mania that has swept the entire teen population and is now jumping up with excitement. Andy - thanks for the link, very handy! **Ter - amazing suggestions - you must be a parent to a 14 y/o or are one yourself **\\nI\\'m too young for children. I\\'m 12. If it were me, I\\'d make priority for the Dior exhibit - that\\'s just up my alley when it comes to special exhibitions. But I get having to make a priority and if it falls because of the limited time you have - since I travel overseas I often have a bit longer stays than that. But I\\'d LOVE to read a trip report where someone gets to see it - I won\\'t be able to visit during its run. ;) It\\'s your trip not mine though.\\nSee if FIT has anything that suits you?\\nhttps://www.fitnyc.edu/ Also, how much time have you spent in the Financial District on your previous visits? Some great architecture in this and Tribeca areas. Some suggestions there - you might have seen these already.\\nThe area near City Hall park has some amazing architecture. The Woolworth Building is iconic. I don\\'t know if they have resumed tours again, but this was a great way to spend an hour to 90 min before the pandemic hit to get to see some of the inside of the building (outside is iconic too and can of course be viewed while in the area).\\nThe Frank Gehry modern skycraper is near there too (8 Spruce Street I believe) and of course quite different than the Woolworth Building. He designed some other intersting buildings in other towns too.\\nThe Municipality building is also gorgeous from the outside. Spending a week. Can i get a week long senior pass an any station? I have seen that link but am still confused. I will be visiting for a week and would like to buy the pass without going to some appointment. Is there somewhere I can just walk up and show my drivers license and buy a week long pass? You cannot get a reduced fare Metrocard without the special card\\nYou may pay reduced fare in cash on buses by showing proof (Medicare card, etc.) or at an attended subway booth - but many booths are currently closed\\nhttps://new.mta.info/fares/reduced-fare Understood. Does that mean I can get the card at one of the major stations like Times Square as a walk up? No. You need to go to the Stone St location and apply. They will provide you with a specific senior card and then you use that to load whatever fare you would like at a station.\\nYou may be able to pay for individual reduced rides at station booths. But many of the attendants are not accepting cash. No\\nYou cannot get the personalized reduced fare card at a subway booth It\\'s possible to apply for the reduced fare card in advance by mail, using the process outlined in Post #1. Give yourself plenty of lead time if you decide to do this. Normally, one goes to the Stone St. MTA building near Bowling Green. They take your photo which is incorporated into your card. I got mine the same day, but you might have to spend an hour or two for the process. With Covid, there are likely appointments. Note that these are still the swipe type cards and not the tap cards. Eventually, the second form will become standard for all cards, but not yet. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on now but at height of lockdown you could not get anything at booth in station because agents were not doing any transactions, just sitting there. I lost my senior card so wanted to buy individual trip card while waiting for new senior card, but couldn\\'t do it.Agents would, however, buzz people in for free and buses of course take coin cash (which was in fact what I wanted card for).\\nOn the upside, it only took 2 weeks for new permanent senior card to be issued, instead of usual 4 weeks. Hello all, I\\'ve been ready this forum and got a bunch of great ideas for my trip to NYC next week. It will just be me and my wife. I wanted to see if you all thought this itinerary was workable, and had any suggestions.\\nWednesday - Get in late to LaGuardia staying with an acquaintance in Long Island City will just take a taxi to LIC from the airport.\\nThursday - Get up in the morning and take an Uber to our hotel (AC Hotel Downtown). Drop our bags and walk to the 9/11 Museum. After that is done, walk back to the hotel (trying to get an early check in) and freshen up and change to go to a Stephen Colbert taping (already have priority tickets). Dinner will be just whatever we come across that looks good (or if anyone has a place they recommend in the area).\\nFriday - Get up head up towards Central Park. Do the Met when it opens and then walk through Central Park until about 3:30 head back to the hotel to get ready for dinner. Reservations at 7:45 for Le Bernardin.\\nSaturday - Thought we would head over to Brooklyn for the day, so maybe get breakfast/brunch in Williamsburg. Then just spend the day exploring that area until 3 head back to the hotel to get ready for dinner. Was thinking of going to Joe Allen before our Broadway show - seeing the Lehman Trilogy.\\nSunday - Possibly doing Buvette in the West Village for breakfast then just wandering the streets check out area head through Washington Square Park to end up at Veselka in the East Village for my next meal. Just kind of want to leave this day open to explore at leisure. So any suggestions also welcome.\\nMonday - Head to the airport in the morning to head home.\\nIf anyone has any suggestions or changes glad to hear them. I have enjoyed reading others itineraries and trip reports for ideas. Thanks Sounds great to me. Now I will add the Stephen Colbert show to my itinerary. I wish they offered tickets farther in advance.\\nI would add visiting the American Museum of Natural History to the list as it is truly a wonderful museum. I\\'ve been there once before and plan on returning on my upcoming trip.\\nEdited: 3:24 pm, September 15, 2021 Sounds like a very relaxing trip, not rushed at all.\\nNear your hotel the recently revamped Pier 16 and Seaport area might interest you for a look around.\\nWhile you\\'re at The Met there are a couple of other smaller museums nearby that you might consider if the weather doesn\\'t turn out good for walking Central Park. The Neue Galerie is good. The Cooper Hewitt is not far and the Museum of the City of New York is a little further north. These would only take a couple of hours to get through.\\nAfter you\\'re done in Williamsburg, you can take a ferry back over to the Pier 11/Wall St pier in Manhattan which is not far from your hotel. The cost is $2.75 each and it\\'s a nice trip from Williamsburg. The ferry goes under three bridges: The Williamsburg Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, and the Brooklyn Bridge. It\\'s a great trip. The Met has timed entry so you may want to get your tickets ahead of time to be sure it’s available for the time you want. I think it also saves you time waiting in line to do it that way. Yes, arrange your Met entry as soon as possible. Also, they require wearing a mask at all times in the museum and this applies to all persons. On your Williamsburg Saturday, I recommend adding in the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg to your wandering. Both are very close by to the ferry stop (less than 5 min walk), and I agree with Aynat on that being a great way to return to Manhattan.\\nEnjoy! Sounds like a wonderful weekend! I was at Veselka over the summer and didn\\'t find it to be anything special, but it might be for sentimental reasons like it was for my friends who used to go there in their NYU days. I had no connection to the place and found the food bland and dull. Thank you so much to everyone who responded. I will take a look at the other museum recs and definitely buy my met tickets early. Thanks so much for the ferry and Williamsburg ideas, I didn\\'t realize there was a ferry option so will definitely be our return plan and the flea market sounds fun.\\nI don\\'t have any connection to Veselka, just saw some recommendations on here and someone told me they like it, so I won\\'t make it a must stop. \"I had no connection to the place and found the food bland and dull\"\\nThats essentially describing Russian/Ukrainian food is general, compared to other cuisines at least. Veselka is not fine dining by any means. Its old, iconic, and more like a Ukrainian diner which means hearty, grandma, comfort food. So bland to some could mean just what the dr ordered to others. If you want to try Pierogis especially this is the place.\\nThe location is in a slowly disappearing Little Ukraine. If you want to try something much more local but much less touristy, check out Streecha nearby, not exactly a restaurant but a church sponsored eatery. You can even volunteer to make Pierogies there on Fridays (assuming they are still doing it).\\nLittle Poland is another one, more diner-like than Veselka What Ziggy said. I\\'m one of the persons who sometimes recommend Veselka here - for the reasons described by him. Where would you recommend for a massage in/near Chelsea? I\\'m especially interested if the spa offers unique or non-western experiences. I found the Aire Ancient Baths, but the reviews of the actual massages are not promising. Some near Chelsea others not so close but a lot of them are unique.\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/health-beauty/the-20-best-spas-in-nyc I\\'ve never been but this Thai place sounds promising if you just want a massage\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/banyan-tree-thai-spa-new-york-2 I presume you are aware that offers of \"massage\" may actually be for something else. Legitimate practitioners of medical massage are licensed by the State of New York. Yes, lol. Definitely looking for an day spa experience, no extras desired. #1 - Thank you for that list, many great options!\\n#2- I will check that one out! Don’t know if this is what you have in mind, but I can recommend the Caudalie spa, just south of 14th St, for a really nice relaxing experience…..\\nhttps://us.caudalie.com/boutique-caudalie-meatpacking Bliss Spa on Broadway has always had excellent massages, and very nice facilities, whenever I\\'ve gone there, but not sure what type of unique or \"non-Western\" offerings they have. Any recommendations for a good deal on a car service? LGA to near Empire State Building. We dont want a taxi. Taxi is really easy and reliable.\\nYou can try Dial 7 or Carmel, both are big outfits that are used often. Always used Carmel. However on TA and others reviews lately are terrible. I see Dial7 also has more bad than good reviews.\\nEdited: 5:05 pm, September 15, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 4:12 am, September 16, 2021\\nEdited: 4:12 am, September 16, 2021 I would advise a taxi.\\nI frequent Carmel limo and Dial 7. Unfortunately, lately the only cars available are on the more expensive side.\\nThe last time I tried to reserve car service from the above; I was quoted $68.00 from the UES to Penn Station. It was not even rush hour.\\nI do not know if this is intentional, if people are using car services more or if there is another reason.\\nWhen in the city and need a taxi; the curb app has worked well for me. Thanks for the response. We have used Carmel for many years, and still use them regularly (as recently as a few days ago). I can highly recommend them, based on personal experience.\\nwww.CarmelLimo.com\\nBetter if you book airport trip at least a day in advance, and not wait until just before you have to go.\\nSometimes they do not have cars available at the last minute at busy times.\\n(And they are much busier these days doing local trips within the city for folks who do not feel comfortable taking the subway right now.) I hear you but it is difficult to go against the reviews. There are many!!!!!!!!! Sure, I understand if bad reviews deter you.\\nI can only speak of my own personal experiences and those of family members & friends who have also used Carmel for years…and we continue to find them very dependable.\\nAs I said in my previous post, you have more options if you reserve with them in advance — eg, more likelihood that the least expensive vehicles will be available for when you want to go. That’s why I book at least a few days in advance for airport trips.\\nCoincidentally, I’m taking Carmel to LGA very early tomorrow morning, and booked that a week ago. No problem reserving a “standard” vehicle instead of “luxury” car. There have been times when I wait to book until last minute and they only have the higher-priced options available. But if anything that’s my fault for not booking sooner, certainly not their fault for being busy and not having every option available all the time.\\nUp to you what you feel comfortable doing; but I should also point out that those regular customers who have used them for years don’t normally take the time to be posting positive reviews each time we use them. Apparently we should…..\\nEdited: 6:20 pm, September 16, 2021 Thanks I booked them today. Now I’m going to worry about you….😎\\nBut then again tomorrow will be my second Carmel airport trip in a week, coming home from LGA & heading back to LGA tomorrow.\\n(& my husband used Carmel to go uptown for doctor’s appt the day before yesterday)\\nSo bon voyage, hope you’ll come back & let us know how it goes…..\\n(& now I also feel guilty I don’t usually bother to write good reviews each time I use them.)\\nEdited: 6:42 pm, September 16, 2021 Hi. Hoping to spend Christmas 2022 in NYC with 2 children who will be aged 11 and 13. The eleven yr old is a vegetarian. Top tips for where to eat on Christmas day please (appreciate it\\'s over a year off!) Thanks. At this point it\\'s unclear which restaurants will survive the pandemic\\nHowever it is not uncommon for locals to dine out on Christmas day\\nThere is no one traditional American Christmas day menu so finding someplace that will accommodate the needs of a vegetarian should not be a problem (Many of us can\\'t face another turkey so soon after Thanksgiving)\\nWhat elements would you like? A scenic view? Menu items you consider traditional? Check the Top Questions on the right about prior Christmases to get an idea of what might be out there. Check back here in about 13 months to make plans for X-mas 2022 https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12943009-Christmas_Day_2019_in_NYC_What_to_Do_Where_to_Eat-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHere is a list from 2019 as there were no restaurants open last year due to the pandemic and this year\\'s list hasn\\'t yet been posted. As Northern Traveler said check back next year in October or November with the FAQs on the right side of the page. I thought you were asking whether to have lunch or dinner.😄. Many restaurants close earlier than usual to allow staff some family time. So you can start a meal from noon to maybe 8 pm.\\nTips\\n-The earlier you eat, the more young kids will be around you.\\n- Most places that stay open have set price multi course meals (I.e $75 for 3 courses with a few choices for each course). Kids\\' meals are usually less than adults but the 13 year old may be considered an adult at some places.\\n- there are usually vegetarian options but IMO it,s usually poor value for money at a set price meal.\\n- Assuming the veggie likes pasta, an Italian restaurant may be a good option\\n-eater.com and grubhub.com are good places to look at reviews and they generally have a list of places for holiday meals, but by the time they publish the lists, it may be too late to book.\\n- absolutely book in advance unless you don,t want a special holiday meal.\\n- if you’re not looking for a traditional Xmas meal, a Chinese or Indian restaurant might suit everyone. It\\'s not clear whether you are looking for something special, or are just concerned you won\\'t have many/any options (like in the UK). There will be many, many restaurants open. If you want something special, perhaps where you get dressed up, you will need to make a reservation and plan the rest of your day so you can all be dressed and ready on time. If you just want a good meal, and want to keep your day flexible, you will still find lots of places for a walk-in meal. I always have Christmas dinner in a diner, and can recommend Good Stuff, Westway and Skylight. The link provided in reply #3 will give you a good idea of the advice, options, and prices pre-pandemic. Hopefully life will be normal enough in 2022 for a nee thread like that to be posted that September.\\nIn the meantime, rest assured that you’ll have many options of places to eat that day, both Christmassy and not!\\n(I’m a vegetarian and so is one of my children. On Christmas Day 2019 my family had lunch at ABC Kitchen)\\nEdited: 6:43 am, September 16, 2021 >>I always have Christmas dinner in a diner, and can recommend Good Stuff, Westway and Skylight.<<\\nI like a New York City diner as well. Unfortunately Good Stuff Diner (One of my favorites ) has permanently closed. 2nd Ave Deli\\nEdited: 8:35 am, September 17, 2021 I just got back a couple days ago from a week long trip in NYC (Sep 6-13). Before I left, I made my very first post on this forum asking you guys a few questions ahead of my trip. I first want to thank everybody who replied. Your answers and tips were very, very helpful.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13658226-Visiting_NYC_next_week_A_few_questions-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHere are some thoughts from my trip:\\n- The city felt very vibrant and alive. More so than I was expecting given the ongoing situation with Covid. Before arriving, I really wasn\\'t sure what to expect. I\\'ve heard different things from different people living in the city. As a first time visitor, NYC felt the way I always imagined NYC would feel like. It was crowded, busy and fun. There were some areas that seemed noticeably quieter, like Midtown East and the Financial District, but Midtown between 5th Avenue and 10th felt very much alive as did other areas. If this is what NYC is like with 70-80% of the office jobs still WFH and tourism still below pre-pandemic levels, then I can\\'t begin to imagine how crowded the city is when everything is 100% normal. The \"New York City is dead\" takes from a year ago didn\\'t age well at all and/or were being made in bad faith.\\n- I stayed at the Yotel on 42nd street and 10th avenue. Nice and affordable hotel that\\'s definitely geared towards a younger crowd. I would recommend it for singles and couples in their 20s and 30s. Not so much for a family trip or for the older crowd.\\n- I had great weather luck. Only one overcast day (last Thursday). Other than that, just perfect weather.\\n- The subway was very easy to use and I got the hang of it very quickly. The 7-day unlimited card is a must. I used the subway several times a day. The only thing that tripped me up is how sometimes a train will skip certain stops. On my first day in NYC, I was in the Flatiron District on 23rd street. I wanted to go to Rockefeller Center but the uptown F train skipped the stops on 14th and 23rd. I had to ride down to 4th street just to take the uptown train to Rockefeller Center. Nearly missed my reservation for \\'Top of the Rock\\' because of it. From that point on, I begin paying closer attention for status alerts on the MTA website on my phone. Also, there are some weird people hanging around the subway stations, especially at night. However, I always felt safe riding the subway.\\n- I did all four observation decks and I would rank them this way: 1) Top of Rock 2) The Edge 3) One World Trade 4) Empire State. Did Top of the Rock at sunset/night and the views were stunning. The Edge was really cool at night. One World Trade was fine. Wish it had an outdoor deck. Empire State was my least favorite, but they did have the best exhibit before going up.\\n- I loved all the urban parks like Washington Square, the Flatiron District and Union Square. But Bryant Park was my favorite of them all. Spent all of time there. Great place to chill.\\n- I did the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island thanks to advice from people on here and I am so glad I did. Easily one of the biggest highlights of the trip. Seeing her up close was awe inspiring. You wouldn\\'t get those views from the Staten Island Ferry.\\n- The 9/11 Memorial and Museum were incredibly well done, and visiting the day before the 20th anniversary made it even more poignant. Just wish the museum wasn\\'t so crowded so I could take in everything better.\\n-The views of the lower Manhattan skyline from Dumbo are incredible. Best spot for a photo is Pebble Beach. Took pics from there on Saturday night with the 9/11 tribute beams of light on display. IMO the best spot in Brooklyn to get a pic.\\n- Citi Field is a much better ballpark than Yankee Stadium. Went to games at both stadiums and had good seats for both (lower level, infield seats). Yankee Stadium just felt soulless, Maybe it\\'s because the stadium was nearly half empty and the Yankees lost when I went, but I felt very underwhelmed. Citi on the other hand was awesome. Been to several ballparks in MLB and I would put Citi Field near the top.\\n- The US Open is a must if you\\'re in town when it is happening, even if you aren\\'t a huge tennis fan. Saw Djokovic-Berratinni on Ashe and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.\\n- I know locals hate Times Square, but seeing it all lit up in person for the first time was very cool. I hate when I read posts from locals advising tourists to avoid it because it is a tourist trap. Well duh. It\\'s a tourist trap for a reason. It does get a bit old after walking through it a few times, but that first time in Times Square is an eye popping thrill. Anybody visiting NYC for the first time should make a stop through. Just don\\'t buy anything there.\\nI love being to pop into any pizza place a buy a huge slice of pizza. Truly a New York thing. There were a couple by my hotel called \\'2 Bros Pizza\\' and \\'99 Cent Fresh\\' pizza. They were may, but got the job done and were cheap in a city with expensive food. Joe\\'s Pizza was definitely the best pizza I tried in NYC.\\nNow a few negative points:\\n- Some places in the city felt very dirty, particularly the areas around Times Square and Port Authority Bus Terminal. Trash lying around the sidewalks. Garbage bins overflowing. Given this is a huge tourism spot, you would think the city would do a better job of wanting to keep it clean. I was in Chicago earlier this summer and their downtown was much cleaner.\\n- The number of homeless people sleeping on the streets was pretty jarring. I\\'m from Michigan and spend quite a bit of time in Downtown Detroit, which nationally doesn\\'t have the greatest reputation, and not even there is the homelessness that bad. Is this a recent phenomenon or has it always been this way?\\n- TSA at JFK are some of the rudest people I\\'ve ever come across. This is more of a JFK criticism, not of the city. The airport overall is nice, but some of the people working security have no business being there.\\n- My final complaint once again has nothing to do with the city itself, but with this particular company. On Monday, I was standing on 34th street wanting to go up to the Empire State Building observatory deck. I hadn\\'t yet bought tickets. A man wearing red shirt with a \"Top Views NYC\" logo on it approached me to sell tickets to the ESB. He told me you had to make reservations ahead of time. I was in a rush and my decision to come to ESB was a spur of the moment type thing. This was my last day in NYC and I had to be at the airport in a few hours. He told me he can get me tickets. I stupidly trusted him and gave him my debit card. He charged me $77 for a ticket that is supposed to be $42. When I asked why, he said it comes with a bus tour, which I NEVER agreed to. I had no time to do a dumb bus tour. When I tried getting in the ESB, I found out the tickets weren\\'t even good for the observatory deck. It was only for the bus tour. I was literally scammed. It\\'s been over 48 hours and I am still trying to get my money back from these people. It left a sore taste in my mouth right before I ended my trip. Please avoid the red shirted people who offer bus tours from \\'Top View NYC\\'. I noticed around all the tourist spots. They\\'re scam artists and I wish the city or NYPD would start cracking down on \"businesses\" that pull this crap. /End rant\\nSo despite that frustrating end to my trip, I had a blast in New York City and I can\\'t wait to come back again some day. This trip matched and even exceeded my expectations. NYC truly is the greatest city in the world. It has some flaws, but all cities do and all the good things about NYC far outweigh the bad. I spent eight days in the city and I wish I had eight days more. Would like to explore other parts of the city the next time I visit like Brooklyn, Queens and other neighborhoods in Manhattan than I didn\\'t get around to exploring much this time around because there is just so much to do in this wonderful city. Can\\'t wait to come back! Great trip report!! I am glad you had a good time. Sorry about the scam at the end, that sucks. Haha, I previously said \"get ready to want to come back\",\\nI love your trip report, thank you for sharing all the details. You did so much and none of it included shows or museums. (?) It shows there really is so much to see and do! Great report! We loved Top of the Rock in 2019. Love that you did them all and compared them. We noticed a LOT of homeless in 2019 so I’m guessing that’s not a new thing. No one ever bothered us at all, but it was a little jarring. I’m curious to see if the city looks “dirtier” when we return next month. I’d don’t remember getting that impression last time. We were also in Chicago in August, for the first time, and the city was definitely clean. Thanks for taking the time to report.\\nGlad to hear you enjoyed all the urban parks , they are a favorite thing for me as well. I love Bryant Park too!\\nVery nice overall report.\\nEdited: 9:12 pm, September 16, 2021 happy you had a good time thanks for your report Chicago is cleaner than NYC because they have alleys to put all the garbage in. Chicago has alleys because it was rebuilt basically from scratch under a master plan after the fire of 1871. NYC\\'s street grid is lot older and developed more \"organically,\" generally without alleys, so the garbage must go on the sidewalk or street. Thanks for reporting back, including criticism, and glad to hear you had a successful trip. That was a great trip report. Thank you for sharing! Hi, My husband and I are thinking of attending a Yankees game Tues or Wed Sept 21 or 22. We like to travel in an somewhat unstructured style. How available are tickets if we wait until game day and buy them at the stadium box office. We aren\\'t looking for the best seats, just the experience and atmosphere, with seats in the $30 to $40 range. We just want to make sure we aren\\'t shut out. Thanks! You should be able to look on Ticketmaster and see availability now. Depending on the opponent, it’s unlikely there will be a sudden rush in the next 5-6 days for any remaining seats.\\nEdit: I just checked StubHub.\\nThey’re playing the Texas Rangers and StubHub has 4,000+ seats for each of those games.\\nStarting from $8.\\nI think you’ll be fine. :)\\nEdited: 10:32 pm, September 16, 2021 You should easily be able to get in the building on a Tues/Wed vs the Rangers. Stubhub will likely be much cheaper than the box office as IrishFan demonstrated. Ex-New Yorker returning after 35 years. I know it\\'s completely different now of course.\\nLooking for a few restaurant ideas. We\\'re there for a week. Dinner is the major hurdle. My girlfriend has some light sensitivity issues.\\nShe can\\'t stand places that have spotlights shining down or even worse in your face. That or even just bare light bulbs. I think it brings on migraines for her. So dark and cozy is great. Fine dining is perfect. $70-100 for two would be perfect.\\nAnything is good. Italian, Japanese, Seafood, French (major +) and others. Not so much on Asian types like Chinese, Thai, Indian unless it\\'s really spectacular.\\nThanks for the help! Is your girlfriend finicky, or does she have light sensitivity issues?\\nEither way, I\\'m a fan of St Tropez and Jeffrey\\'s Grocery in the village. Both have good food and, while I haven\\'t paid particular attention, the lighting has not seemed harsh at all.\\nGood luck. You should try Nocello, lights are low, there is a little space at the front of the restaurant which is really romantic. And the food is really good. You might want to consider Frenchette, it\\'s quite low lit and romantic: https://www.frenchettenyc.com/\\nIt\\'s a pity Le Coucou hasn\\'t opened yet because that would have been perfect.\\nAnd this is a list of a few \"romantic\" restaurants in NYC :https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/the-most-romantic-restaurants-in-nyc Try any one of the Felice restaurants. They are dark and don’t use spot lights, and within budget. And food is great. They just opened another one - I think it’s now 6 of them.\\nAlso, if you consider eating outside, the lighting may be much better for her in many places. Try Le Mercerie (it may be out of budget though). I will be traveling to NYC for work often and I need to find nice hotels that have large or clear elevators in Manhattan (or Brooklyn as a second option). For example, the elevators at Marriott Grand Marquis in Times Square do not bother me at all. I am looking for more hotel options with clear elevators like that, large elevators, or no elevators at all. The Marriott can be really expensive sometimes so, having other options at $250 per night or less would be nice. I plan to travel this weekend and once more this month. I am not claustrophobic in any other situation besides being in small elevators by myself. All other crowds and small spaces are fine. Don\\'t know the answer to this, but if I had to guess newer hotels are likely to have more comfortable elevators than old hotels unless they are higher end hotels. I know some of the old cheap hotels have rather cramped elevators and I can get why that may cause issues with some people. Sounds like technology will resolve your \"claustrophobia\":\\nhttps://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vr-headsets\\nJust put them on when you\\'re in any elevator.\\nCH >I am looking for more hotel options with clear elevators like that, large elevators, or no elevators at all<<\\nThe Marlton hotel in Greenwich Village had stair access to all floors , As does the Washington Square hotel also in GV.\\nChelsea pines Inn on W. 14th St. has no elevator at all ,it’s a five or six story walk up. The \"clear\" type of elevators in the Marriott Marquis were popular in the 80s (along with atriums). I think a number of Hyatts around the country built in that era, though not in NYC, had them. I don\\'t know how many other hotels, if any, in NYC are like that, and if I were you I would probably be looking at hotels built in last 40 yrs or so, unless you want to look at older hotels with no elevator. Be wary of 100+ yr old, non-luxury, buildings that may have originally had no elevator, but later had one or more shoehorned in. They would likely be small & claustrophobic.\\nEdited: 11:18 pm, September 14, 2021 Most hotels have rooms on the first few floors and stairs, so you don’t have to use elevators at all Have you tried searching the forum for a few key words about this? I remember a similar question within the last few years. Sorry I can’t remember the answers and don’t have time to search myself right now, but it may give you a start. The Frederick hotel in Tribeca. About 7 stories high. They have rooms on the lower floors too, and people used to use the stairs a lot (there are elevators too) whenever I\\'ve stayed there in the past.\\nAn upside, this hotel is in a great location too. Self-service elevators were not legal in NYC until 1922. Buildings that could not afford an attendant were built to only 5 floors as walk-ups. Those of 6 floors had to have elevators. Building over 6 floors had to be of fireproof construction with a water tank on the roof. This explains the pattern of residential buildings in the city. The Incentra Village Inn is only 3 floors or so and all rooms are walk ups. No elevators involved at all. But you\\'d need to be able to handle stairs with and without luggage. Very nice Village location too.\\nhttps://www.incentravillage.com/ To my knowledge, there are no other hotels with glass elevators in NYC. Know that at some times of year, no decent hotel is $250 or less. Radio City Apartments is a budget hotel with stairs that open in the lobby if you want to avoid an elevator. The subject says it all : how busy is it really during the first two weeks of december?\\nI`m plannig to go to nyc for two weeks in december ( ALONE!!! :O ) , december 1st till 15th. But is it really THAT crowded 24/07 in all places , so not only the rocker center and time square? For example : how crowded is chelsea market on a week-day ? is this elbow 2 elbow busy and unbearable? How is a simple store, like Sephora on a week-day? Or the Public Libary , the Highline the MET , Greenwich Village ? My assumption is that all these places will be VERY crowded in weekends, but im not only going in the weekn , i`ll be there for two weeks.\\nI know this is a very hard question to answer, because its a personal issue \\'\\'crowded\\'\\'. Here`s a list of things I want to see/visit.\\n- Wall street\\n- Museum of History\\n- MET\\n- Brooklyn Bridge / Brooklyn / Soho\\n- Battery Park\\n- Central Park\\n- 9/11 Memorial\\n- Time Square (ugh I know, but you HAVE to see it youknow)\\n- Public Libary\\n- St Patrick Cathedral\\n- China Town\\n- Greenwich Village\\n- Bryan Park\\n- Dyker Heights\\n- Highline\\n- Occulus\\n- Tarrytown (propably)\\n- Broadway show ( im thinking of the Cursed Child or Wicked)\\n- Top of the Rock / Rocker center\\nAnd how are the bars and restaurants. Is it really that you have to que outside on a weekday like Tuesday night to get a simple drink/cocktail in a bar? Or things like Butchers Daughter, Five Leafs etc. Same question really.\\nYou might ask yourself : why december? Because I am mad for christmas decorations, however, I do have the first two weeks of october as a back-up instead of december.\\nI hope I made my question clear, since english is not my first language. I just want to know , how busy is it really on monday till friday ?? Ques? Unbearable? Elbow to Elbow?\\nHope to hear from you ! I’m going to give you an answer based on my pre-pandemic experiences, so the caveat is that things may be different again this year.\\nThe first two weeks of December, museums and attractions are fine during the week. On weekdays in early December I’ve taken guests on “Christmas in NYC” walks to see Bryant Park, Rockefeller Center, and other Christmas decorations in Midtown and it’s lovely and uncrowded. I also gave tours at the natural history museum (AMNH) pre-pandemic, and early December was still calm.\\nThere aren’t a huge number of true tourists in NYC in early December — the mass of them arrives once schools get out. (That’ll be roughly December 18th through January 2nd this year). But the weekends still get very crowded, because that’s when locals and people living in nearby suburbs have time off to come in and see the Christmas attractions.\\nYou should have a great time being able to go and see the sights on weekends, Covid allowing! 😊🤞 The answer is THIS YEAR, We dont know and thats because international travel is largely forbidden. As long as international travel is not happening NYC wont be that bad.\\nAlso domestic travellers at this time are somewhat trying to avoid cities and crowded places meaning NY is getting less domestic tourists than normal as well\\nThis could all change if the corona situation changes, however I dont see that happening for this christmas time\\nAny particular reason you want to go to Tarrytown? Do you mean Sleepy Hollow? While Sleepy Hollow might be cool for Halloween or maybe a day trip for a local, Im not sure someone with a limited amount of time should go there\\nFor someone with 2 weeks, Id go to more plaes in Queens Brooklyn and some secondary parks like Ft Tryon Park/Cloisters , The High Bridge (Not the High Line) Flushing Meadow Park and Flushing . Brooklyn Grand Army Plaza (Prospect Park/Brooklyn Museum/Brooklyn Public Libary) and Id consider The Bronx Zoo / Arthur Ave in the Bronx We visited during that timeframe in 2019 specifically to see the decorations and shop at the Christmas markets. Things were crazy busy even on weekdays especially near the Rockefeller tree, the Saks light display and any skating rink.\\nWe liked the Bryant Park market best, the subway notalogia trains and all the lights. There are several threads you can search in here that highlight suggested attractions and walking routes.\\nIf you go, I would book a hotel ASAP because most places fill fast May be lighter this year if international travel doesn\\'t open. We stayed in Long Island City (suggestion from this forum) and it worked out great. Only one or two subway stops from Midtown, cheaper and closer to LGA. I was in times square and Rockefeller center last year (2020) and it was dead\\nHere is the tree\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CIw2URHr9ea/\\nTimes Square\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CIwvUGALWKG/\\nThe problem is we do not know what travel will be allowed, Also we dont know what domestic travels will come and we dont know what extended Locals (People from NYC suburbs who come to the City to see the tree and the lights) , these peple take the train in and go around the city. Just too many unknown variable.\\nIf I had to make a guess, It wont be that crowded as even locals try to avoid larger crowds That is what I expected :( But was it dooable? Did you still enjoy your visit or did the crowd ruin it? And how was commuting ? I have probaly already have a B&B in Brooklyn , to avoid the high cost :) Be careful that that Airbnb is legal! Most are not! Even if OP doesnt care about legality of AirBNB, many are in bad neighborhoods, Some of the worst neighborhoods of NYC are in Brooklyn (Most tourists wont accidently wind up there so its not an issue for normal tourists as these areas are not tourist neighborhoods In their other thread the OP said they are in Holland so it is unclear if they will be permitted to travel to the U.S. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html I do live in holland yes , and if I will be permitted , I dont know yet. Its a guess I am taking now. Thankfully many hotels + B&Bs offer full refuns not long before arrival. So I do to that in account.\\nfun thing is , the b&b`s that I did see, are in fact in Brooklyn , so I guess I`d better stay clear of that one then\\nEdited: 10:15 am, September 16, 2021 Every year we get questions about going to see fall foliage. For those who are contemplating doing a trip here is the NYS fall foliage map. If you are interested, I\\'d suggest bookmarking the link & checking it every once & a while.\\nhttps://www.iloveny.com/things-to-do/fall/foliage-report/ Thank you for sharing this. I am going to check out that website. I am seeing a lot of information regarding travel passes for purchase and download to your phone. Me and my family will be in NYC for 4 days in October, can anyone recommend one of these tour passes? Thanks Most attractions passes for nyc are not recommended as they provide vouchers that you have to turn in to get a reservation. Are you asking about public transit, sightseeing attraction passes or both? sight seeing attractions, please. List the attractions/places that you plan to visit. Price them out vs the cost of the pass...and time needed to redeem the vouchers.\\nMany people simply book direct with the attractions/locations. A pass REALLY is not needed in NYC. Due to the pandemic, many places that previously did not have timed tickets now require them\\nI do not know if any of the attraction pass providers have ways you can book an admission time before going to the venue. I\\'d want to figure out if it is possible before making any pass purchase The NYC Go website has information on the various passes and pluses and minuses of each one. From my reading, the places that require timed entry still take the pass, but you have to book your time online. Other places you can just walk up with the pass. It tells you the process for each site so you can see if it makes sense for you.\\nhttps://www.nycgo.com/things-to-do/tours-in-nyc/attraction-passes We generally don\\'t recommend attraction passes in this forum due to all the restrictions that are not really disclosed when you purchase. However, if you must use an attraction pass, use one that lets you pick & choose your attractions & don\\'t use them for attractions that require timed entry as these passes use a voucher system where you can\\'t book your attraction ahead of time so that by the time you get to the venue to redeem your voucher. the desirable slots are already booked. Also, don\\'t fall into the trap of buying a pass and feeling that you now need to see/visit the majority of things listed.\\nThere is so much to do/see in NYC and you can experience that by just walking around the city. Yes...do check out some of the major attractions and also the attractions that the others really want to see. But do take some time to check out some of the neighborhoods outside of the general touristy areas. I have a question. We are from Kentucky and it has always been my dream to visit NYC. After a cancer diagnosis this past year, I want to start making some dreams a reality. We would drive from Kentucky. I have always heard how crazy the traffic is. Would there be a way to stay outside the city and take a bus into NYC to tour the places we want to see? My husband and I are both uncomfortable with attempting to drive in NYC. Any suggestions or options? Could stay in new jersey and take the train in. Depending on how uncomfortable you are with city driving you could look for parking garages on the far west side so you don\\'t have to drive across Manhattan. The west side highway isn\\'t that bad IF you avoid the rush hours. and some garages are located in close proximity to it. Where things become more complicated is when you start driving across Manhattan or even the interior of some of the other boroughs. I\\'d recommend staying in Manhattan - especially if you might want to go back to your hotel for a rest and freshen up\\nIf driving in to a garage in Manhattan seems too much, there are options to park in New Jersey and take transit or a car service in to your hotel (assuming you\\'re arriving from and departing to the west - if elsewhere there may be other suggestions)\\nTo get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired and 3) hotel budget.\\nSorry about your diagnosis but glad you\\'re pursuing your dreams I am a VERY nervous City driver myself, but I agree with #1. The West Side Highway is not bad (I won’t do east side highways), and if you want to stay in the Times Square area you can make 1 left turn off the WSHighway and find a parking garage (I like the ipark on W.50th, when you leave, it’s a very easy left onto 8th ave, left onto 57th, and you’re back on the WS Highway to leave the City). You can download the ParkWhiz app to help find other garages in the area. GOOD LUCK! It\\'s definitely possible to stay outside of the city and take mass transit in - Secaucus, NJ is one stop away from Midtown Manhattan on NJ Transit and only take about 10 minutes, and there are plenty of other suburban towns around NJ. Jersey City and Hoboken are right across the river from Manhattan (although the last time I was in Jersey City, it was more annoying to drive through than NYC). You could also consider further out in Brooklyn, Queens, or the Bronx, where the traffic won\\'t usually be as congested, but the further out you go, the longer it\\'ll take you to get to the more touristy parts of the city.\\nThat said, I agree with others that the West Side Highway isn\\'t terrible and you should consider staying in the city and parking in a garage on the west side. If you\\'re going to drive this far, yes you could stay in Secaucus for example. But, you\\'re that close and driving through the tunnel and parking/staying on the west side, possibly midtown would be easy enough. Commuting in each day adds to your daily routine, plus it\\'s a lot harder to go back to your hotel to freshen up if you have to travel a distance. Stay in Manhattan, it will enhance the trip, don\\'t stress the driving, in my opinion, driving into Manhattan and not going that far in is easier than driving in some other places in NJ, such as Jersey City. Thanks for the advice! if you really want to stay away from the city driving, you could stay in Weschester and take the train in. I\\'d recommend Tarrytown on the Hudson Line, New Rochelle on the New Haven Line, or White Plains on the Harlem Line. very suburban driving and the freeways are not crazy congested generally. A suburban location will involve commuting time and expense and possibly relying on a hotel shuttle to/from the train station\\nThe Metro North does not run 24/7 and NJ Transit trains & buses have limited late night schedules\\nIf you must choose a location outside Manhattan look at Hoboken or Jersey City within walking distance of the PATH train https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/index.html The PATH is similar to, but separate from, the NYC subway system. It runs 24/7 and is only $2.75/ride\\nIf at all possible stay in Manhattan and figure out parking you are comfortable with (further parking advice can be given if desired) But Kaye staying in Jersey City or Hoboken to avoid driving and parking in Manhattan is counter productive, since driving and parking in those places is worse than driving in Manhattan and getting to the hotels and PATH there involves more City driving than a hotel or a garage in Manhattan right outside of the tunel #9 - I don\\'t disagree driving there is somewhat challenging\\nBut staying elsewhere in NJ or Westchester will have the inconveniences I mentioned\\nDo you have any other location suggestions?\\nHopefully you have noted I think they should stay in Manhattan and figure out a driving / parking plan they are comfortable with I have read some great reviews regarding the Hotel RIU near Times Square. Has anyone stayed at this location, and have any reviews? I have not stayed here personally but,\\nAnd if you have a specific question On the TripAdvisor page of this hotel you can ask it.

Can you please help to check and confirm the subways I am planning to take are the right ones? I will be staying in intercontinental - New York Time Square.\\nFrom the hotel to Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island cruise - take subway 1 on times square 42 St & 7th Ave and get off in south ferry station.\\nFrom Brooklyn bridge park back to the hotel - take subway A or C on the high st and get off on times square 42 St & 7th Ave .\\nFrom the hotel to high line - take train 7 on Times Sq - 42 St & 7th Ave and get off on 34th Street-Hudson Yards Do you have a smartphone? If so, it will give you exact directions &, when you are traveling, the site will give you timings & let you know if there are any delays or detours. That is correct, only the A and C will take you to 42nd and 8th instead of 42nd and 7th. It\\'s the same giant \"Times Square\" station, but for that stop you might hear or see \"Port Authority\" instead. You can take the 1 to the statute of liberty cruise. It is a local train so it will be a number of stops. If you want you can also walk right down to port authority and take the A train express to Fulton street and then switch to either the 4 or 5 for two stops to Bowling Green. Will save you a little time but if you are not comfortable making transfers then you can just stick with the 1.\\nFor Brooklyn Bridge park yes the A&C from High street are probably the fastest but almost as fast if not close to the same is taking the 2 or 3 from Clark street. I would actually recommend this more as I think walking up among the brownstones would be more scenic than the walk to high street. Just take the Squibb Bridge to go up into Brooklyn Heights.\\nYes the 7 train runs to Hudson Yards but unless you have mobility issues you can easily walk there and back. Look into Citymapper app for your smart phone . You don’t need addresses, You do it by landmarks ,sites hotels ,restaurants, stores whatever it’s all pre-programed.\\nIt gives you options; walking ,bus , subway, ferry commuter train or a combination,With you step-by-step directions and timings you can’t go wrong.\\nIt even shows you which subway car is the least crowded and Informs you how to leave the subway at the proper exit. blumebwaybaby: I have a smartphone, I guess I\\'ll have to learn how to use it for subway. :)\\nKevin H: Thank you for checking! :) I am glad to know that they all look right! It\\'s good to know the stop is Port Authority :) I was thinking I needed to get off on 42 st.\\nred259: Thank you for the suggestions! :) I\\'ll take the A train express to Fulton street . I might just walk to the statute of liberty cruise. :)\\nYour recommendation sounds great! :) I\\'ll taking the 2 or 3 from Clark street instead. :)\\nI\\'ll do as you suggested - I\\'ll walk to Hudson Yards:)\\nCaminoMundo: Thanks for the information! I\\'ll look into Citymapper app for my smart phone and earn how to use it.\\nThanks again to everyone for your time and help! :) Start using your smartphone to plan out the trips you will be taking when you\\'re in the city. If you get confused. ask a young person to help you. They\\'ve grown up on the technology & they are really savvy on helping you. We are fully vaccinated. I have felt safer eating outside because of the improved air flow. I don’t feel safe eating inside. For upcoming NYC trip, I have been planning for outdoor dining. Now I see that outdoor dining is for the unvaccinated while indoor is for vaccinated only. I still don’t feel safe eating inside even though everyone should be vaccinated; my fully vaccinated teen caught Covid this summer working a mostly indoor summer job. It was NOT fun! But, eating outside is now stressful if a vaccinated person is eating amid only unvaccinated people. How is this working out in practical terms? That’s not correct. Vaccinated diners have the choice to eat indoors or outdoors (tomorrow night, I’m going to Avra w a vaccinated friend - we choose to eat outdoors), unvaccinated diners must eat outdoors. Many vaccinated New Yorkers continue to choose to eat outdoors. It’s hard to successfully assume whether the people closest to you are vaccinated or not.\\nThere are many outdoor dining restaurants that have plexiglass between the tables. If you are concerned, you should go to restaurants with that added protection. Off the top of my head: Odeon, Rosemary’s, Pastis, Elea, Portale, Rezdora, Sadelle’s, 12 Chairs - all places I have been to with dividers between outdoor tables. Tamarind has separate little cabanas for individual parties. You may be most comfortable in a place like that.\\nEdited: 8:51 pm, September 13, 2021 This is great info, I\\'ve been wondering the same! **Now I see that outdoor dining is for the unvaccinated while indoor is for vaccinated only. **\\nAs stated, this is incorrect. Vaccinated people have the choice to eat inside/outside.\\n**How is this working out in practical terms?**\\nQuite simply, from what I see, people are making their own choices. If someone is vaccinated and want to eat outside, they do.\\nI ate and had drinks at 3 places this wknd. None of them asked my vaccination status. #3 - \"I ate and had drinks at 3 places this wknd. None of them asked my vaccination status.\"\\nJust curious, did you choose to be seated indoors or outdoors? **Just curious, did you choose to be seated indoors or outdoors?**\\nAs you know, the weather was great this wknd. I ate outside. **Just curious, did you choose to be seated indoors or outdoors?**\\nI did also go inside the Essex St Market just to see how they would be set up.\\nNo questions asked to go inside. I saw several stalls with laminated postings that stated that you have to provide proof if you wanted to eat/drink there. The complex provided them as the ground floor is city owned. I believe the the lower level is private.\\nI spoke to the guy who works at Top Hops and he said that they were not looking forward to Monday(first enforcement day.) The city has made free signage available https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/counseltothemayor/downloads/Key-to-NYC-FAQ.pdf Some have questioned the safety of outdoor dining sheds that may have worse ventilation than an indoor dining room. Only one restaurant so far asked me for vax proof, and that one place didnt ask for ID. I dont think it will be enforced much for a variety of reasons. Some restaurants already said they rather pay the fines, and some are suing.\\nTo answer the OP\\'s question, in Manhattan most likely those around you will be vaccinated, in or out. But its hard to say where its safer. In November/December it may become safer outdoors as some of the vaccines start to wane, especially for those that took Pfizer early on. And there\\'s a good chance we will get hit with one more wave as a result and as people move indoors. I will be in NYC for Columbus Day. I know it is a bank holiday but not sure how it is celebrated in NYC - if all all. What is the parade like? Columbus Day really isn\\'t a big holiday in NYC outside of the parade. If you don\\'t partake in that, it will seem like a regular Monday. https://loving-newyork.com/columbus-day-parade-nyc/\\nHere is a link to the Colubus Day parade info. ha, I\\'ve lived in NYC most of my life and I\\'m not sure that I ever knew there was a parade! Which I guess is an indication of how much the holiday is celebrated (which is not much). You might see more people out and about during the day and at the park or museums or restaurants because some people will have the day off, but beyond that I can\\'t imagine you\\'ll notice much. Banks are closed and no Mail Thanks. Sounds like it will be mostly like a regular Monday except for the mail and banks. I was planning on getting a mail in Covid test but with mail service delayed - thinking using LabQ so no need to mail anything in. New renderings are shown here.\\nhttps://www.thehighline.org/connections/\\nI quite like them.\\nThe Moynihan Connector (completion 2023) is an elevated path that will connect the High Line at 30th Street to Moynihan Train Hall through the new Manhattan West public plaza on 31st Street and Dyer Avenue.\\nThe Hudson River Park Connector (still in research and design) would extend from the High Line westward to Hudson River Park. This would start at the northwestern end of the High Line, which currently terminates at 34th Street and 12th Avenue. The western part of the Moynihan complex will have a food court that was not yet started when I was there a month ago. At the south end of this is an entrance with a very clever artwork showing buildings hanging down from the ceiling in a sort of aerial view. The north entrance has \"non-inclusive\" mosaics of people.\\nEdited: 6:50 pm, September 14, 2021 Another food court (good and bad idea I suppose). Many closed or tenants left over the last 18 months, some not fully open even now I believe. This is great.

We arrive on Monday @11:30am to NYC via train and return to Boston the next day at 2 am. Staying in the city one night near Broadway, what suggestions do y’all have for us to do late in NYC while we wait for our train. Please note that we most likely will have our backpack with a spare outfit and neck pillows. Thank you Go to a Broadway show?\\nSince we don\\'t know anything about you or your tastes/likes/interests, the chances we will pick the Right Thing for you are pretty slim The Staten Island ferry runs all night (a half hourly service in the overnight hours.) So if the weather is clear, that might make an interesting activity when most other things are closed. The 1 train subway runs directly between Penn Station and South Ferry. I don\\'t think you could bring a backpack into Broadway, but you could bring it most places.\\nThe SI Ferry is a good idea. Some of the observation decks are open late.\\nYou can definitely find restaurants and bars open that late. If yiu can fit the bag under your seat you should be able to bring it to Bway So one night you will be staying at a hotel? I would just ask to see if they will store your backpack until closer to departure time so you don\\'t have to lug it around with you everywhere. I like art, food, architecture, history, music, comedy, movies. And did I mention food 🥰 First, get rid of the backpack so you’re unencumbered. Your options are\\n-Leave it at the hotel\\n-pay for a luggage storage place that,s open 24/7 (Schwartz Travel might work)\\n-if you’re taking an Amtrak train at 2 am, they should be willing to hold your bag\\nAs far as what to do, a show, and/or jazz club or comedy club? The Empire State Building is open late. There,s a new Staten Island ferry from midtown that might be fun to do roundtrip for views. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 8:10 pm, September 14, 2021 Broadway show and a late dinner.\\nHang out for a while in a late night diner. Some are open 24 hours. Take a look at Applejack, Europan Bakery, Cranberry Cafe. That 2 a.m. train to Boston is one of the few with checked baggage. So sometime during the day bring your bags (and your ticket) to Amtrak baggage claim and drop off your bag. You can then pick it up when you get to Boston South Station in the morning. There\\'s no charge for doing this and you don\\'t have to wait until just a few hours before departing to do this. I’m looking for ideas for 2 couples visiting NY from out of state for a Saturday Brunch in the city. We are staying in Chelsea but can go anywhere for it.\\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? A rooftop or fun atmosphere would be awesome.\\nThanks! Budget/entree or whole meal if it\\'s table d\\'hôtel? Budget is flexible! Just looking for a fun brunch with a good atmosphere and good food:) Don\\'t have any rooftop recommendations, but Balthazar is my kind of fun atmosphere with very good brunch food. 12 Chairs and Shuka are both fun for brunch - kind of a party atmosphere. Buvette usually has a line but could work for you. There\\'s a new restaurant, Dagon, that I\\'ve been eyeing but haven\\'t been there yet. Friend of a Farmer is solid. The Standard Grill is always fun. We are planning a trip of new England next summer. my mother really wanted to include a broadway show in the schedule if we can manage. Our next stop is Yale University. Someone in a previous post suggested we take the train to Conn. and then rent a car there as opposed to trying to drive thru NYC - which I thought was a GREAT idea! But I am so fretting about dealing with baggage etc on the train that I am now wondering if we should just fly into New Haven or somewhere and grab a hotel there and just take the train into NYC that night to see show and then back to hotel in Conn after - or is that too much \"travel\" time - Am I overthinking this? thank you so much! The airport in New Haven is really small. Are there flights that you can get which will take you there and are in your price range? How big/much is your baggage? There are racks over the seats on the metro north trains. If you travel at non-rush times there will probably be open seats for luggage as well. It is normally cheaper to fly direct to NYC than into New Haven. If so I would take the money I save on the flight and book a hotel in NYC the first night (maybe somewhere in midtown not far from grand cental and go to the broadway show that night. Then the next morning take the train up to new haven to do what you need to do at yale and get a rental car etc.\\nThe problem with flying into new haven (if you wish to go to broadway) is lack of available flights direct flights (I believe all the commercial flights have to route through PHL), price, and the fact that it is like at least two hours each way on train. While it can be done that is a lot of travel time in one day. Good to know red259…I hadn’t even thought about availability of flights in new haven….\\nWhat is the difference in grand central vs penn station/Moynihan? What I mean is does one have more advantages over the other? Easier to maneuver etc. thanks so much! Amtrak from New Haven to NYC is just under 2 hours.\\nAre you concerned with the Amtrak notation \"no checked baggage\". That means you do not check in in and pick it up like on a plane. You take it on the train. You can arrange for \"red cap\" service to bring you and tour bags to the train. They work for tips. I would just use metro north out of grand central. No reason to get involved with amtrak if you are just going to new haven. Amtrak doesn\\'t save much time. It can be much more expensive if you are travelling off-peak hours and the cheapest tickets I believe have to be for a specific train and seats can sell out. With metro north you simply buy either a peak or off-peak ticket and can use it on any of the trains and there are multiple trains an hour. Grand central is not difficult to maneuver. There are ramps if your luggage is on wheels. The difference between Grand Central and Penn Station/Moynihan Hall is that different railroads go to each one. All of the Metro North commuter trains (like those that stop at New Haven) go in to Grand, and Amtrak and some other commuter rail roads go into Penn Station. Moynihan Hall is the newly constructed/renovated train hall at Penn Station that opened this year,\\nFrom New Haven, Metro North to Grand is about 2 hours, and a little less with Amtrak to Penn (making much fewer stops). As far as fares, Metro North is $17.75 during off-peak travel times / $23.50 peak travel times. For Amtrak, there are fares starting at $16 with advanced purchase. As a previous poster mentioned, Amtrak tickets are specific per train, where for Metro North they are valid on any Metro North train on that route.\\nIf you you know your timings, then I think Amtrak might be easier with luggage. There\\'s larger above seat storage and storage at the end of each carriage for even larger bags. Just be sure to purchase your tickets in advance to take advantage of lower prices.\\nEdited: 2:17 pm, September 13, 2021 The amtrak ticket prices can fluctuate quite a bit. I don\\'t even know if you will be able to get $16 tickets next summer once demand picks up without buying them way in advance. I know even with low demand later this week they are still charging $26. The flexibility of metro north makes it way easier, unless you have larger than normal luggage. Miss a train? Just take the next one.\\nEdited: 3:11 pm, September 13, 2021 Metro North trains to New Haven all start at Grand Central, so are likely to be on time. Amtrak trains from Penn Station to New Haven will almost always have originated in Washington, if not further south, so there are many more risks of delay before the train even gets to New York.\\nBecause you don\\'t book a specific train on Metro North, you have that additional flexibility about your departure time.\\nEdited: 4:18 pm, September 13, 2021 If you are not familiar with this part of the country, we have \"parkways\" that are restricted to cars only with no trucks or buses. It is possible to take the Hutchinson River Parkway in the Bronx whose name changes to the Meritt as you go towards New Haven. This is a much nicer drive than I-95, though you eventually have to get on local streets near New Haven. I presume you are going to stay in New Haven for a night and you would have to figure out how to get to the car rental from there. The Yale campus is one of the most beautiful in the US architecturally. The fraternity meeting halls near the cemetery have striking designs. There are two moderate size museums on the central campus with important items. The world\\'s only surviving Roman infantry shield is in one. Kinda surprising that there is only one roman infantry shield left in the world. I guess because they were made of wood if I recall correctly. Likely staying in Brooklyn for the next visit.\\nBetween 1 Hotel, Marriott Brooklyn Bridge and/or one in Williamsburg (not sure which one), does one stand out in terms of location as far as walkability to neighborhood restaurants, pubs and attractions??\\nThanks Williamsburg tends to be younger and more European than downtown Brooklyn (where the Marriot is). It used to be a really artsy/hipster neighborhood, and still has some of that feel left, though most of the artists have moved farther out to Bushwick. Both neighborhoods are walkable. There are a few more streets with heavy car traffic in downtown Brooklyn, if that matters. I prefer the restaurants and bars in Williamsburg, though I\\'m sure others differ. The Marriot is walking distance from the Brooklyn Bridge (duh), and across the bridge to all the attractions in Lower Manhattan if you\\'re up for the walk. Williamsburg isn\\'t really a place for traditional tourist attractions, though the views from the waterfront are nice. The William Vale Hotel in Williamsburg has arguably the best roof deck view in all of NYC, though that hotel probably costs $$$.\\nI come at this with the perspective of someone who has lived in North Brooklyn (Williamsburg/Bushwick) for a long time and prefers the vibe. Others on this forum live near and prefer Downtown Brooklyn, and I\\'m sure they\\'ll chime in.\\nEdited: 1:21 pm, September 14, 2021 I\\'ve stayed at the Marriott Brooklyn Bridge several times and like the hotel overall. It\\'s not a bad location - between Downtown Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights. Lots of subway lines into Manhattan and further into Brooklyn nearby. I might choose a different hotel in the same area to be closer to restaurants and bars. I\\'ve not stayed at the 1 Hotel, but the location is good and has a great view of the bridge and lower Manhattan.\\nPost #1 does a great job of giving you an idea of Williamsburg. Again, the other 2 hotels you mention are good hotels and not bad locations at all, but if you are looking for nightlife, tons of restaurants, etc., I\\'d go with a Williamsburg hotel. The William Vale in Williamsburg is very walkable to lots of shops and restaurants in the area and to the Bedford Ave station. Great rooftop bar with sublime views. Other hotels nearby are the McCarren, the Whythe, the Hoxton, the Williamsburg. Another good thing about those hotels is that you have the ferry at the North Williamsburg pier that will get you over to Manhattan, besides the subway. And Greenpoint nearby has some good restaurants. No one has posted about 1 Hotel in Brooklyn bridge park. Location is phenomenal. Right on the water. Depending on when you come if it is summer or fall location is great for walking to the heights or dumbo. In winter would not be my first choice. The roof top bar has probably one of the best views of anywhere around. Very hip space. If you are staying at the hotel you get priority to get in which is nice. The restaurant osprey on site has better food than I expect in a hotel restaurant. Going to NYC, with family, Oct 10-13, and looking for a decent priced hotel in the Midtown area. Usually stay near Grand central, so not familiar with this area. Thanks so much. You are going to have to define \"decent priced\". It can mean anything.\\nAlso, how many beds are needed. What do you mean by a decent price including 15% tax? What is you desired bedding configuration? I should have been more specific, $200-$250 a night. Grand Central is midtown. if there are children, what are there ages which can make a difference in pricing? ages are 16 and 13, two beds needed. Thanks Like pp said- near GC is midtown. So, what are you thinking re. midtown? What do you want to be close to? And why do you want to be in that area vs another neighborhood? Close to central park, i am not opposed to other areas, just trying to decide. For your dates The Hampton Inn Times Square North shows under budget for a room with 2 queen sized beds. AAA rate @$179 per night totaling $689 including taxes and fees, Rate includes breakfast each day. 4 day cancellation policy. Hotel is located at 851 8th Avenue between 51st and 52nd streets. 7 short blocks to Central Park. Look at the Hotel Beacon. It\\'s on the UWS but very easy walk to Central Park and extremely close to a subway station. Lots of good restaurants and shopping around there too. It will be a nice change from your past stays. It sounds like maybe you are thinking of west midtown now (Grand Central is in east midtown). I suggest looking at hotels from high west 40s to mid west 50s between 6th and 8th avenues\\nI think there are several reasonably priced options in that area that have been recommended here. They have the advantage of being near, but not in, Times Square, and also near Central Park, theaters, and good public transit. Looks like we are back to some semblance of normalcy on Thanksgiving Day!\\nhttps://www.macys.com/social/parade/?\\nCH Hello all!\\nMy family has a trip planned to NYC in December. We have been fully vaccinated for months now. However, my sons 17-year-old girlfriend will be coming with us. She is unvaccinated and will not be getting vaccinated. No rude comments please. We love her like she is our own but that is ultimately not our decision to make for her.\\nWe understand proof of vaccination is currently required at restaurants. While we have considered simply ordering take-out, I wanted to ask if it\\'s reasonable to think NYC patios would be comfortable in December? In other words, do most have patio warmers, wind-blockers, etc.?\\nAdditionally, does anyone know if proof of vaccination will be required for ice skating and other outdoor activities?\\nThanks in advance! ***She is unvaccinated and will not be getting vaccinated. No rude comments please. We love her like she is our own but that is ultimately not our decision to make for her.***\\nFully agree, it\\'s her decision to make.\\nIn my opinion, eating outside in December is far from optimum, but many will likely still be doing so. Sure, those heaters help, but it\\'s still outside. Her choice not to get vaccinated, but maybe NYC isn\\'t a good place for an unvaccinated tourist especially in winter with limited options. Eating outside in the winter is ok on warmer winter days. It pretty much sucks on colder days or on most nights. And it\\'s closed for days when we get a decent snow.\\nAnywhere that is enclosed enough to keep warm on colder days isn\\'t somewhere an unvaccinated person should be. I ate outside all last winter, many restaurants invested in good heaters which I am sure they will want to use again this year. Some have enclosed structures, which I would urge you to avoid under these circumstances - a respectful request in case I\\'m sitting nearby! The heaters worked really well...in fact, I took a 2 hour zoom meeting at an outdoor restaurant in January mid-afternoon, NOT in the structure, but just near a heater. I also ate outside on a night that it was sleeting, under a large umbrella with a heater nearby, and was perfectly comfortable. I would guesstimate that I ate outside every 2 weeks all winter last year. It\\'s doable, and frankly, kind of fun - I think you will enjoy it! Whenever a server or busser came to the table, I put my mask on, which this young woman should do - it\\'s respectful. Actually, I still do it when the server comes to the table, even though I\\'m vaxxed. So, I\\'m suggesting that you do the same as I do, please. I found that proper dress helped - loose coat, and a big scarf that allowed for flexibility (if the heaters warmed me up enough, I took the coat off but still had the scarf.)\\nI would urge you all to stay outside as much as possible. There\\'s plenty to see and do. If you are in close quarters with others, sharing status is appropriate....for example: I\\'ve been on Amtrak a number of times, and an airplane a few times, and each time, I volunteer to my seat-mate \"I\\'m vaxxed\" and they say whether they are or aren\\'t too. Then we all can modulate our behaviors accordingly.\\nI am striving not to sound judgmental, but if by chance I do, please know that I am in mourning for a college classmate who died this week from Covid.\\nEdited: 6:29 pm, September 12, 2021 Since you won\\'t be able to go to theaters, museums and attractions like the observatories itinerary planning will be important Where are you staying , I belive Hotels in NYC require proof of Vaccination There is no legal requirement that hotel guests have to be vaccinated. However, some hotels do have a policy that they will only accept fully vaccinated guests, so it is worth checking with the hotel to confirm if that is a requirement or not. As always the rules can change and since it is highly likely the US will see yet another covid surge this Fall and given that one of the vaccines now has full FDA approval there could be more restrictions imposed on unvaccinated people in the future. I suggest you take her to someplace like Disney or Vegas or Hawaii this Christmas and save NYC for when the pandemic is over.\\nEdited: 7:14 pm, September 12, 2021 Most NYC Hotels have some sort of food service between a resaurant, Bar o just the area where the breakfast is served Hi All - I finally had a chance for a quick trip to spend a little time with my niece and daughter and have some fun. Love this city so much and my last planned trip was March 2020... yeah, didn\\'t happen.\\nDaughter is currently based out of Newark and niece is a grad student at Columbia. This go round I didn\\'t plan/map out the day and we kinda decided spur of the moment on things to do. Thus we were all over the place but that was ok because it was mostly about getting caught up on each others\\' lives.\\nII will post each day separately. Looking forward to this! Day 1 -\\nArrived at Newark airport bright and early and took NJ transit to Penn Station. One of my favorite parts of visiting this amazing city is when I come up the stairs and boom, here I am!!! Walked to the hotel, Hyatt Place on 39th, and was able to check in. My daughter\\'s schedule was unexpectedly changed last minute and instead of meeting me, she wouldn\\'t be able to come until the next day. But that was ok, now I had one on one time with my niece. She met me at the hotel and from there we basically walked all day, lol.\\nI wanted to walk the Highline so we headed toward Hudson Yards gabbing the whole time and nearly missed the stairs up. We thoroughly enjoyed strolling along, admiring all the flowers and trees. It wasn\\'t terribly crowded so that was nice. We stopped at Chelsea Market to take a look around. Gotta say, we were underwhelmed. I didn\\'t realize it was mostly eateries and we weren\\'t quite ready for lunch yet. From there, we decided to check out Little Island and that was fun! We walked all around it and admired all the views and got lemonades since we didn\\'t think to bring our waterbottles. After a short break, we decided to just walk along the Hudson River Park. We kept walking and talking and stopped for a break near the dog park - there was a nice shady spot with a cool breeze. We realized we were starting to get hungry and both were thinking burgers. I remembered reading about them recently, so we decided on Paul\\'s Da Burger Joint. We also decided to walk there which was so lovely - our route took us through Washington Square Park. So many people out enjoying the weather, it was great to see. It was a much longer walk than we thought so we were starving by the time we got there! We picked a table outside since it was shady. The service was great and the burgers were huge! We thought they were pretty tasty and because we were so hungry we almost finished them.\\nFrom there we decided to walk to the Flatiron district and see what that was all about. Our path took us through Union Square Park so we rested for a few minutes and looked around. Then we continued on and were a bit disappointed since I didn\\'t realize the Flatiron Building was covered in scaffolding. But that was ok - we really enjoyed sitting at a table in Madison Square Park just chatting and people watching.\\nBy this point, my early morning flight was catching up to me and I needed some coffee. Niece wanted to try Ralph\\'s Coffee and again we sat outside and enjoyed a latte. From there we decided to walk back to the hotel and get cleaned up. I wanted to treat my niece to something that evening and the Birdland Jazz Club was just a few blocks away.\\nI bought tickets for The Lineup with Susie Mosher. Our vaccine cards were checked at the door. We were given a table in the front row and wow! that was fun!!! So much talent! We were thoroughly entertained. After the show, we figured since we were right there, we popped over to Times Square to look around. It seems different from my previous visits, but I couldn\\'t quite put a finger on what it was. At that point we were exhausted from all the walking and called it a night. Looking forward to reading more about your trip!! It sounds great! Wow....this is a lovey read ...thanks for posting. I am looking forward to reading the rest. Your trip report is getting me pumped for my visit next weekend! Looking forward to reading the rest of it. Great report so far!! Loving it. Following along for ideas for our October trip. Didn’t do the High Line last time so that’s a for sure. Great report so far. I am endlessly fascinated by what people choose to do, spur of the moment. Can\\'t wait to read more! I think its kinda cool OP didnt do the most popular things and did other things like Madison Square Park, I dont think ive ever seen that mentioned Thank you everyone! On to day 2 -\\nMy daughter was able to get back to Newark fairly early and make it to Penn Station by 11:30. So niece and I met up at Westway Diner for a quick breakfast. We weren\\'t looking for anything fancy and the price was right. The service was great! I had gotten there way before my niece and my waiter had offered to sit and keep me company until she got there. He kept the coffee flowing too. Needless to say he got a great tip lol!!! After we ate, we walked down to Penn Station to meet my girl. She was already outside and beaming with joy to see us and the city. We walked back to the hotel to drop off her bags and decide on the day\\'s activities. The only planned activity we had, now don\\'t laugh, was tea at Bergdorf Goodman. I know, New York isn\\'t famous for their tea but to my little girl that is what she associates with NYC - Eloise, The Plaza, etc. So anyway. Today was her day and we wanted her to be happy.\\nAfter dropping her bags, our first stop was Mood. K has been a long time Project Runway fan and this would be our 2nd visit (first was back in 2014). Since it was so close to our hotel, we decided to humor her. She even pretended to run through the aisles the goofball. From there we decided to mosey over to 5th Avenue and slowly walk up toward BG. I wanted to go in St Patrick\\'s Cathedral, but the girls outvoted me and we went into Saks instead. They wanted to look at shoes. No purchases were made. Our reservation time was getting close so we continued on to Bergdorf Goodman.\\nK threw me for a loop when she asked if she had to have the afternoon tea. I will not lie - I gave her the mom death glare!!! However, I remained calm and asked why - she never had breakfast and was worried the dainties wouldn\\'t be enough. Since we had no time table, I told her to have the afternoon tea and if she was still hungry we could order something else. When the lovely three tier tray came out we all wondered if it would be enough. Very dainty bites indeed. However, everything was delicious and I gave K my deviled egg because she loved it so much. The girls were cracking me up with their selfies and boomerangs. We had a wonderful time, very attentive service and as I knew, K was full and didn\\'t need to order more.\\nSince we were right next to Central Park, we decided to walk off our tea and meander through the park. We just wandered around and each took turns picking a path. Eventually we wound up at the tunnel by the Bethesda Fountain. The girls took some pictures and then we decided to make our way to the west side of the park and catch the subway uptown to see Niece\\'s apartment and campus. I must say, it was very nice to be able to sit down and not walk all the way up to 116th! Columbia is a very pretty campus and K was a bit jealous and briefly thought it might be nice to go back to school!\\nAt this point, the girls were out of ideas on what to do, and as crazy as it seems, I suggested we go to Brooklyn! It was such a beautiful late afternoon I thought we could have an early dinner and walk back across the Brooklyn Bridge as it was getting dark. The ladies were game so that is what we did. Luckily niece is a pro with the subway so we were able to take an express to Clark St. We decided pizza would be tasty and I had heard about Juliana\\'s so we slowly strolled our way down. We all loved the quieter feel of the area. We were able to get a table right away and shared a large meatball pizza - sooooo delicious!! It was now prime sunset time and we walked down to the Brooklyn Bridge Park. Oh my goodness, it was just magical. The sky had such a rosy hue, the skyline was starting to light up - just breathtaking. After admiring the view for awhile, we made our way to the pedestrian walkway for the bridge. I underestimated the number of people with the same idea. It was a tight squeeze and with the bikers whizzing by, we were very careful when we had to go into their lane to get around all the influencers trying to get that perfect shot. None the less, the girls were very impressed with the views, so I gave myself a pat on the back, ha!!\\nNow it was completely dark, and even though it was relatively early we were exhausted. We caught the subway and parted ways at the Times Square station. K wanted to take a quick peek at Times Square, and she too felt it looked different. We made our way back to the hotel and called it a night. So I’m traveling this week to NYC. I have my itinerary and I will visit all the usual and tourists spots. My last day though I have no plans yet so I was wondering any neighborhoods or hidden gems to visit and wander. The Village is a great neighborhood to explore.\\nTake a look at this site, so many great self guided walks, mix and match, etc.:\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html Agree\\nEast Village\\nWest Village\\nIn that order. Though try to do both, using Washington Sq Park as a resting spot Thank you so much\\nIs this close to Greenwich village? Because that was on my itnrary Yes, kinda. Greenwich village depending on who you ask is the area in between West and East Village or a larger area that encompasses West Village. Generally locals dont call it Greenwich Village anymore so it lost its definition over time Ziggy mentioned Washington Square Park as a resting spot, I agree. But, if you want to further your walk, go from Washington Square Park to Union Square, then up Broadway to Madison Square Park. It\\'s a great walk and plenty to see, etc.\\nOne tip, don\\'t wait until your last day to do some meandering, it might very well be a highlight of your trip.\\nGood to see you back Ziggy. yay Ziggy is back ..... Thanks Andy, Jenny. Good to be back. I think! If you want out of the Box , Go to Forest Hills Gardens\\nhttps://www.6sqft.com/forest-hills-gardens-a-hidden-nyc-haven-of-historic-modernity/ Following for great suggestions. Always the Villages. East Village for a more grungier vibe, West Village for a more refined vibe imo.\\nSoHo has really pretty cobble streets and wrought iron architecture.\\nFlatiron District for Madison Square Park and the Flatiron building and shopping on 5th and 6th Aves.\\nBrooklyn Heights for lovely town homes, cobble streets and views over to Manhattan.\\nWilliamsburg, Brooklyn for a laid back yet young and vibrant atmosphere. On our last visit to New York in 2018, we used a car service to/from LGA. We flew Delta. I remember it was a hassle and a bit of a walk getting from baggage claim to meet our driver. Even having to call him several times. I chalk some of this to the construction which I understand is still ongoing.\\nWe arrive on Thursday, October 21 around 10 am, again on Delta. Advice on whether to take a car service or a taxi. And if so, the estimated fare for a taxi. I already have the price for the car service. Thanks in advance. Many of us recommend taking a taxi to your hotel (since the taxis are sitting on the taxi line) & then taking a car service to the airport (so that you don\\'t have to search for a cab.) You must meet a car service at the designated area adjacent to the terminal https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides\\nThere is a Yellow cab dispatcher line at the terminal curb. Cab rates are metered by time/distance and will vary https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/by-taxi\\nA car service booking may be convenient for the return - they can drop you off at the terminal curb Hello all -\\nI have been to the city many times, always as a tourist for a short trip. This time I am planning to stay in the city for 3 weeks and try to live like a local.\\nI want to avoid the touristy area I always used to go to but stay in a neighborhood around the locals. Would like to be able to walk to restaurants/cafes/food carts etc or take the subway.\\nLike maybe the upper west side? Looking for ideas on where I can stay.\\nDo hotels/apartments offer short term lease ~1month?\\nThanks! Be aware that the majority of AirBnB Style short term apartment rentals are illegal in all five boroughs of NYC\\nThey are illegal in any residential building with three or more units. The only potentially legal ones are in one or two family houses - which are uncommon in areas that are desirable or convenient for visitors https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/articles/liz-krueger/answers-new-yorkers-concerned-or-confused-about-illegal-hotel-law and https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/about-illegal-short-term-rentals.page\\nThe source of the offer does not matter - the legal classification of the building does. No internet middleman, even otherwise respectable or well known ones, vets listings for compliance with local laws, leaving visitors vulnerable.\\nTo get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station (OR if driving and need parking - directions of travel) and 4) hotel budget. There are some legal apartment style hotels if a kitchen is important.\\nEdited: 6:03 pm, September 09, 2021 I wasn’t aware of this, thank you for sharing.\\n2 people - will be working from there throughout, so good internet, enough space for both of us work and take calls.\\n(Part of the reason why I was looking for Airbnb/apartment rental in the first place)\\nDon’t care about a kitchen - I’m there to explore food, just a microwave and a refrigerator would do. Laundry room would be amazing\\nBudget - 200-300$ per night\\nDates - oct 1st - oct 20th\\nEdited: 6:14 pm, September 09, 2021 The upper west side would be great but with only a few hotels, I\\'m not seeing any that fit your budget and your needs. The hotels are\\nBeacon- too expensive\\nArthouse- too expensive and no fridges\\nNewton- not available for the whole stay\\nThe Phillips Club is a possibility but likely too expensive.\\nhttps://phillipsclub.com/short-stay/\\nAKA is a group of hotels with suites. Affinia is another but their prices look to high and locations are maybe not as residential as you,d like. The Beekman Towers in midtown east would be lovely but too $$#.\\nThere are options in the financial district which is both residential and business. Mint House at 70 Pine might work. Haven,t checked prices. Bottom line, you might do better by staying for a full month. Some places can only rent for a month and might wind up cheaper than paying per night for 19 nights. Look again at the Hotel Newton on the upper West side . I do see availability for October 1 to the 20th. Although availability is limited at this hour. It has microwaves and refrigerators in the rooms.\\nAlthough some rooms don’t have view to the street , your windows are looking at a wall.It’s clean and the rooms are a decent size. Lots of restaurants cafés grocery stores.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d112039-Reviews-The_Hotel_Newton-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nYou could skip the looking for room w/microwave and refrigerator and focus on location and room size. With that criteria you could certainly find more options in budget on those dates .\\nThere are coin operated lot laundromats in Manhattan where you can do your own laundry. That’s what I do . I visit for longer stays myself.\\nWhen I find myself in a room without a coffee maker ,I use an inversion heater that you heat water in a Porcelain mug and make instant coffee in morning before I can go out and get myself a better brew.\\nEdited: 10:00 pm, September 09, 2021 Thank you for the suggestions.\\nThat’s a good point, I can do without refrigerator/microwave.\\nWhat places do you recommend that might be cheaper for a month? I can totally do a month!! Sorry immersion heater not inversion.\\nhttps://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/portable-immersion-heater/1011091717\\nAs for the month stay at a lower rate. I can’t say. But check out the one Whiz mentioned- Minthouse 70 Pine. See if you like the location and what it has to offer.\\nEdited: 10:08 pm, September 09, 2021 Assuming you\\'re talking about this year / next month - Travelzoo has a deal for the Beacon, $299 for a king suite through the end if the year (all dates excluding around Thanksgiving and New Year\\'s Eve.) Around $350 a night including taxes.\\nFor that you get lots of space - 620 sq feet - a separate bedroom and living area, plus a kitchenette. Wifi included.\\n(Rate for the same king suite drops to $169 in January & February).\\nhttps://www.travelzoo.com/hotel-booking/hotel/8415/hotel-beacon/?marketType=2&searchGuid=6baaa424-16da-4c30-8b1f-e8a33f58f231&pageId=2100b28c-372e-44d9-8a84-2f4ba64a4129\\nEdited: 5:39 am, September 10, 2021 You might also want to look in Brooklyn. The hotels along the Third/Fourth Av corridor in Boerum Hill, Gowanus & Park Slope would give you the kind of location you’re looking for (pretty residential streets nearby, tons of restaurants, good transit access, etc.) but (a) the immediate surroundings are dreary and (b) I have no idea what the facilities are like; I do know it’s been a tough time for hotels.\\nI’d also look at the Box House in Greenpoint, though it’s less convenient to the subway.\\nYou may be able to find a legal Airbnb in a neighborhood like Park Slope or Windsor Terrace, but I have no idea what the current market is. It wouldn’t surprise me if the nice ones are more expensive than hotels. Brooklyn and Queens will give you a different experience, however for the most part in the local parts of Brooklyn and Queens, there arent any hotels, Locals live there, not tourists Some rooms at Arthouse have fridges. Ours have.\\nI think Beacon would work though as the rooms will be conducive to working from.\\nI was going to suggest Brooklyn too.

I\\'m hesitant to make any type of reservations for museums or restaurants or nightclubs because we are basically waiting until the last minute to decide and watching what is happening with COVID.

Do most restaurants require dinner reservations?\\nWe are both fully vaccinated but really struggling with the idea of traveling to a big city and doing a lot of indoor activities. But I\\'ve put this trip off twice already since 2020 and would love to be able to come. I will say, I don\\'t want to come if I can\\'t go dancing. Is it nuts to even think about a nightclub right now? **Do most restaurants require dinner reservations?**\\nThere are over 20,000 restaurants in NYC. Most do not require a reservation.\\nHowever, if you want to go to a specific/well known/popular one, you might look into making one. ** Is it nuts to even think about a nightclub right now?**\\nProbably. What\\'s the weather typically like in mid March? Lots of rain? \" I will say, I don\\'t want to come if I can\\'t go dancing. Is it nuts to even think about a nightclub right now?\" Some clubs are open. People have to show proof they are fully vaccinated to get in. Things are insanely expensive now. Like bottle service is double the cost it used to be. DJs are charging like double their prices. The city over the last few years have made a lot of changes, so that there can be more dancing etc. There is even talk of setting up 24 hour nightlife districts. Would I go into a club in NYC when there is high covid transmission in the community? Absolutely not. If there is low covid transmission then that is a different scenario. #4 - I just pulled up a dashboard of sorts for NYC and it has all metrics as high, but decreasing. Our trip is still 3 weeks out and we don\\'t have to cancel until a day or 2 before. So I guess I\\'ll just keep an eye on things. Can I ask you how the DJ\\'s raising their prices effects the customers? Higher cover charges?\\nMy next shot at this would be spring break in March. But I\\'m wondering if the weather is rainy then? We do not have a rainy season, we get rain each and every month. March a transitional month, typically the beginning of the month can still be cold, but as time goes by, it gets better and better. But no comparison to early October weather, which is typically very nice and pleasant. I would still try for October, but then March as a back up. I would recommend to come now, Its less crowded and you can get deals.\\nAs long as you are vaxxed there is no reason not to come, Corona rates are very low in the city\\nJust be vaxxed and prepared to mask indoors and you will be fine\\nOctober is the best time to come, pefect Weather May and June are even better than March. But hotels will be more expensive. There are clubs, and people are going to them...I find that people who are engaging in what is \"risky\" behavior are both vaxxed and testing often (big businesses are testing on site, weekly, and there are testing sites all over the city).\\nI tend to make reservations if I am making plans to meet someone. Why wouldn\\'t I? I don\\'t understand the logic of making a plan to meet someone for dinner without making a reservation. But that doesn\\'t mean that you can\\'t make a spur of the moment decision. If you see a place with empty tables that looks interesting, stop in. For most restaurants, there are no consequences to canceling reservations, even last minute, but it is a courtesy to let them know, so they don\\'t hold the table for you. If you make reservations at a place that holds a credit card, pay attention to their rules about how much advance notice they need to cancel or they can charge you. Have you used Luggage Hero in NYC to store your bags and what was your experience?\\nWe have never been to NYC, only flying in and out of LaGuardia and have several hours to kill.\\nThanks. Most of the posters here recommend Schwartz luggage. The storage facilities used by Luggage Hero and similar companies are in places like convenience stores, gift shops, coffee shops, and a few hotels. I have never taken my luggage to such places as I wonder about the security of my luggage.\\nI have used Schwartz Luggage Storage quite a few times satisfactorily. It is actually a luggage store on W. 37th St. near 9th Ave. However, Googling\"Schwartz Luggage Travel\" today gets on one result a \"permanently closed\" message, but not on other results. I called the store, and the guy answering the phone said Schwartz is currently closed but will reopen \"in a couple of weeks.\" So, check closer to your travel date to see if Schwartz is operating\\nI was in NYC, inMidtown West, where there was a blackout day a couple of years ago. I had taken a suitcase to Schwartz that morning. I returned after 8 p.m. walking on streets with most every building dark, no street lights, lights only from traffic. Schwartz was open, pitch black except for a flashlight, The two women in attendance said they had to stay open, people would need their luggage.\\nAlso, you don\\'t specify your arrival and departure times. If you have just three or four hours, say -- you really should stay at the airport Looking for suggestions please! I\\'m planning on taking my mom to NYC for 4 days in January for her birthday. We\\'re from Toronto. I\\'ve been 3 times, in all different seasons and I\\'ve seen/done 95% of the touristy things. My mom hasn\\'t been anywhere since she was a teenager in the 70s and has a fascination with NYC from seeing it on television.\\nWe\\'ll probably still get the CityPass and spend a day or two riding the Big Bus and doing some of the big tourist spots like ESB, Library, 5th Ave, Rockefeller, St Patrick\\'s Cathedral, Macy\\'s, Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square, Central Park, Grand Central, Greenwich Village etc. Her grandparents landed at Ellis Island so it\\'d be nice to take her there. A Broadway show would be nice if budget allows -- the only one I can see her enjoying is Jersey Boys (she absolutely loves 50s/60s music). She\\'s not much a museum/art gallery person but she may be intrigued by the Met. She loves shopping.\\nAs of right now I have the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown West Hotel booked. It has phenomenal reviews for cleanliness and is brand new which will please my mom (see note below regarding her fussiness) but I\\'ve only ever stayed near Times Square. I\\'m worried we\\'ll be a bit out of range compared to what I\\'m use to. Suggestions for other hotels would be great too, I\\'m trying to keep it under $200 CAD/night.\\nI have a few \"musts\" for this trip -- Zabars, The Strand, Stone Street, getting a bagel and of course the usuals of NY pizza and maybe a steakhouse.\\nShe\\'s somewhat \"finicky\" - she\\'s old-fashioned, doesn\\'t like large crowds, she\\'s nervous at times, prefers quiet over noise, goes to bed early etc. I know, It\\'s NYC... hence why I\\'ve chosen January and places like the library, cathedrals, etc. We\\'re Canadian so we can handle the cold!\\nAny suggestions? TIA. Jersey Boys hasn\\'t been on Broadway in a number of years. There was an Off Broadway version pre-Covid that folks liked (very very similar to the B\\'way version, but smaller theater) but I am not sure if it has or will reopen.\\nEllis Island is booked with the Statue of Liberty thru https://www.cityexperiences.com/new-york/city-cruises/statue/statue-liberty-and-ellis-island-tickets/ Since you\\'ve stated that your mom doesn\\'t like crowds (& I\\'m thinking of my dad who had the same preference), I wouldn\\'t suggest any Hop On Hop Off bus. Better to use a van service like Onboard or High Quality Tours where you have a dedicated guide who takes a group around & you don\\'t have to get off one bus & wait in a line to get on another bus. It\\'s probably a bit more expensive but I think it would suit your mother more. This Courtyard is so far west it\\'s close to Hudson Yards. From there you can pick up the 7 train to take you to Bryant Park. NY Public Library is right there on 5th Ave. Walk north on 5th for your tourist sites and shopping or south for Empire State Building. One stop more and you\\'ll be at Grand Central where you will have many subway options to take you where you want to go. The hotel is also close to 34th St. A bus could take you to Macy\\'s, ESB and 5th Ave. Go up 10th Ave to Hell\\'s Kitchen for food options. So from a transit perspective it works. Jersey Boys will be resuming performances at New World Stages on November 15, 2021. You might consider holding off on buying tickets; my expectation is that there will eventually be discounts available for January performances.\\nhttps://jerseyboysinfo.com/newyork I brought my mom (now 91 years old), to New York several years ago. My mom sounds quite similar to yours in some ways, (though likely quite older, just judging by your photo), preferring a quieter life. She does get out and about a lot, and is quite active socially and physically and enjoys new activities. Here’s a few comments/suggestions:\\n1. Don’t underestimate the impact that the pace, people, traffic, so many buildings and all the walking will have on her. I found my mom was good with just one or two “main” outings a day (one active, one less so), and needed some downtime to rest in between. (And early to bed.) I ended up jettisoning quite a few of my plans, and I think you may be overreaching with the amount of activities you have planned in four days.\\nFor example, my mom, a trip to museum, lunch out, downtime, dinner out, Broadway show, was plenty. For yours, who loves to shop, maybe shopping is her downtime? (Shop a bit, rest up at the hotel a bit, and then the Broadway show and dinner?)\\n2. I totally agree with blume’s suggestion of a different type of bus tour than the Hop-on-Hop-off ones. Quieter and a better, more relaxing tone for her.\\n3. Perhaps add a boat tour from Classic Harbor Lines on their Yacht Manhattan. This may seem an odd choice for January, but they run all year (with a limited schedule), and the interior of the boat is a wood paneled intimate and cozy space, with room for just about twenty passengers or so. It has big picture windows too, so you can see a ton without having to venture outside if it’s a cold day. It is such a relaxing way to see the city - very good for a quiet personality. There are just two types of cruises shown being offered so far in January, but it’s likely more will be added. See more at:\\nhttps://sail-nyc.com/public-events/\\n4. If your mom is taking some downtime at the hotel, and heading to bed early, these may be great times for you to head out on your own and take in some of your own must-dos.\\n5. What things make up the fascination for your mom has with NYC? I would dive into that and pursue those things in the schedule, and find ways to make experiences out of them. Could be very rewarding for her.\\n6. I’m not sure about the hotel choice. Although nice and new and clean, I think it’s location is a little bit out of the way, and not the best for subway access, and not the most appealing area. (Having said that, I haven’t been in the area since the opening of Hudson Yards, and much of the new development in the area, so I don’t know what impact that has had on things.) Of course, your previous Times Square locations wouldn’t be right for her, but there is a lot more to choose from.\\nWe have your budget, so if you give us your exact dates of travel, we can give some more suggestions. (I am assuming you would be sharing a room with two beds, right?)\\nEnough from me for now. I hope that is some help. It sounds like a lovely trip and I hope we can be of some more help too. Happy planning! I agree with those that recommend maybe more down time during the day in-between activities? With so much walking and so many people on the street, your mom may get overwhelmed with all of the hustle and bustle of the city. I wrote this yesterday and it basically agrees with what,a been said.\\nThe hop on/off bus tours are open topped which can be really uncomfortable in January. You might consider a smaller tour in an enclosed heated bus. In addition to the ones mentioned, here,s another\\nhttps://www.smallbustoursnyc.com\\nAnother idea would be a movie & tv location tour which would also be in a closed heated bus.\\nhttps://onlocationtours.com\\nI understand your choosing this new hotel, but I\\'m a bit worried it\\'s too far west. The area has only been developed in the last few years and you may find yourselves feeling a bit out of the way. I’m not suggesting Times Square but maybe somewhere with more shops and restaurants right nearby. There\\'s a new Towne Place Chelsea that frankly doesn\\'t look as nice as your Courtyard, but it’s in a more accessible location and prices look so low, you might be able to get 2 rooms within your budget. Rooms have kitchenettes and they also include breakfast. I can\\'t find any reviews which tells me it’s very new.\\nThe. Courtyard Central Park is not brand new but newish and very nice in a great location walking distance to both Central Park and the theaters. The building is the tallest hotel in North America. There,s a Residence Inn at the top and the Courtyard is below that but still high so you don\\'t hear noise.\\nYour wish list sounds like too much for a short visit. Agree do some things on your list while Mom is resting. Wow! Thank you so much everyone. This is so helpful.\\nWith regards to the hotel, I failed to mention the other reasons why I chose it rather than just that it\\'s new. The others were: it\\'s a quick walk to Penn Station where we\\'ll be getting off the train from Newark, it offers 2 double beds within my budget instead of 1 king and offers a city view (not necessary but always nice). If I can get her on the subway (will be difficult - she\\'s seen too many episodes of Blue Bloods) It\\'s only 5 minutes to Times Square and 6 minutes to 5th Ave. The Courtyard Central Park looks great but is unfortunately it is out of my price range. Another hotel I\\'m really interested in is La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Times Square South, however they allow dogs and if she finds out she won\\'t be able to sleep thinking there could have been one in the bed previously. I too am weary of pet friendly hotels, it\\'s not just my mom. While staying at the Element New York Times Square West once there were 2 dogs in the room next to us that barked 24/7. I\\'m waiting to hear back about whether or not they have dog free floors.\\nThank you for suggesting the TownePlace Suites by Marriott New York Manhattan/Chelsea. It\\'s definitely on the list now! I wouldn\\'t be able to do 2 rooms (she wouldn\\'t be able to be in a hotel room alone anyways - way to nervous) but I\\'m not opposed to sharing a king size bed but it would be an added luxury to each have our own if the price allows. I\\'m planning around the dates of January 27-30. Her birthday is February 1 so it works nicely.\\nI never even considered smaller bus tours! That\\'s a great suggestion - I\\'ll definitely look into them. I\\'ve rode the open top buses in December and found it tolerable and surprisingly empty considering it was 2 days before Christmas, but January could be a different story weather-wise.\\nI don\\'t believe she would like a cruise. She\\'s terrified of water (can\\'t swim). Hence why I have Ellis Island as a \"maybe\". It will definitely depend on her mood and the weather conditions.\\nShe may actually really like the movie/tv show locations tour. I\\'m not exactly sure what it is that fascinates her so much. Whenever she\\'s watching a show that takes place in NYC and they show a skyline view, she pauses the television and just studies it. She calls me to ask 100 questions about the city while studying the image, haha. Maybe a trip to Brooklyn to see the skyline and bridges from there?\\nAs for exploring a bit on my own, she would never allow that. She\\'s a very pessimistic thinker. In 2019 I booked a solo trip to a orchestra concert at Highclere Castle just outside of London and she forced my father to go with me. We live 40 minutes north of Downtown Toronto where my boyfriend lives and she goes into a panic every weekend that I drive down there... which I\\'ve been doing for 3 years now. For reference, I\\'m 33 years old haha. The more I think about the this, the more I can see her refusing to go at all. I make her sound difficult but I love her, I swear!\\nThank you again for all of the wonderful suggestions. It\\'s going to be a great help in making an itinerary. Hello, the two of us are thinking of doing WFH from a hotel in Manhatten. One table should fit 2 24\" monitors and a laptop. The second table should fit a 27\" monitor and a laptop. Wifi speeds should be reasonable.\\nAny recommendations for a suitable hotel under $200/night that has sufficient desk space for two people to WFH from?\\nOr one that has an affordable workspace for rent during 9-5 hours.\\nThanks! Hotel prices vary from day to day based on what is happening in town. To get the best advice, exact dates are needed.\\nThat said, I think to find the kind of space you are looking for will need to be a suite. I really do not think you will find that except maybe in January. Some hotels are offering special setups. One is the Benjamin, where it has a special name I can\\'t recall. Some Hyatts may also be doing it.\\nNote many rent a desk places have closed or cut back. One near me on 3d av in 40s in east midtown recently closed for good. I think some WeWork places may still be open, but imagine they have cut back.\\nEdited: 9:42 pm, September 11, 2021 wework.com\\nApparently the pandemic breathed new life into WeWork. Day use rates are interesting, reduced prices for using it from 9-5/6pm. Arlo Nomad has $75 day use but the desk seems to be too small. I don\\'t think you\\'re going to find one room with enough desk or other surface space for all those monitors. Think you will likely need 2 rooms or some other arrangement.\\nEdited: 12:32 pm, September 12, 2021 Are you actually going to bring these big monitors with you? Wouldn\\'t it easier to get to a shared office such as WeWork mentioned by Grandrue or JaySuites or any other coworking facilities in NYC. If you\\'re toting that much equipment will you also have a vehicle that needs parking? I’m also looking for a place where both of us can work, and possibly some separate space so we can take work calls separately.\\nI came across monthly sublets/rentals through vibe rentals. They list on Airbnb as well. I do not know if it is legit or legal since they allow you to rent out the entire apartment. I keep hearing Airbnb’s and short term rentals are illegal.\\nAnyone here have any experience with this or could comment on if it is legit?\\nI would pay using credit card so I can file for fraud if things don’t work out.\\nHow are you planning to get the monitors? We were just gonna buy the cheapest ones from Best Buy and sell or donate at the end of our stay Tomorrow I’ve got a 3-hr layover at JFK in the middle of the day. I’m flying JetBlue in/out of terminal 5, and I see that there’s a Priority Pass-accepting lounge (WingTips) in terminal 4. Is it practical for me to head over there for an hour or two to get some work done and maybe some light food? Would I just walk or take the AirTrain? I suppose I’d be having to go through security a second time, which is an unfortunate hassle.\\nThanks for the advice! Is that 3 hours from scheduled arrival time to scheduled departure time? If so, you need to account for time it takes to de-plane (assuming your plane is on time) and time to board hours next flight (you probably want to be back in the gate area at least a half hour before). Plus time for security and the travel between terminals (probably air train is best) ….so you barely have a an hour and a half. If it were me, I would probably sit at one of the restaurants and work there. (I like the French restaurant.).\\nEdited: 10:37 am, September 13, 2021 You\\'d need to take the Airtrain https://www.jfkairport.com/at-airport/connecting-flights\\nThe lounge is beyond security and I doubt if the TSA will let you enter a terminal you are not ticketed for https://wingtipslounge.com/JFK/index.php/location/\\nYou\\'d have to clear security to enter T4 and reenter T5 so I doubt this is a good idea even if you can access the lounge\\nIf you choose to leave T5 security a visit to the adjacent https://www.twahotel.com/ might be enjoyable “ I suppose I’d be having to go through security a second time, which is an unfortunate hassle.”\\nAnd also the potential issue of whether TSA will allow you to enter Terminal 4 without a boarding pass for a Terminal 4 departure.\\nI used to run into this issue when accessing airport lounges. Sometimes I just told them where I was headed and they let me pass after seeing my boarding pass for the other terminal.\\nOther times it was “ nope”. Are there any places that has a setup like the parks around the city with the ice rinks but with sledding hills? They just opened a place in New Jersey\\nhttps://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/skiing-trips/big-snow-ski-slope-opening-american-dream-mall\\nThere are buses to get there from Port Authority bus terminal. In winter when it snows there\\'s sledding in Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island. There used to be sledding at LaTourette golf course too, but don\\'t know if that\\'s still an option.\\nI don\\'t believe they have sledding at that NJ mall previously posted. Just fyi, it would have to be enclosed to be functional in NYC since it\\'s often above freezing temperatures in the winter. Not sledding, but man made snow (with real snow when possible) and outdoors, could give Campgaw in Mahwah, NJ a try. Not sledding though, but snow tubing:\\nhttps://www.skicampgaw.com/tubing\\nYou could take a train from Penn Station to the Ramsey station, then uber as it\\'s not that far from there. Thank you whiz. I will definitely take a look at this one. Thanks springerandy!! I saw this one on a google search and it’s 45 minutes away from midtown which isn’t bad. You’re welcome. It’s far easier with a car, but doable with public transport. Hello, again -\\nOriginally, I posted in July about visiting New York during this fall or winter. Like a ping pong ball, I went back and forth for two months, yes, no, maybe, not a chance, etc. Finally decided to go and am very excited. It\\'s been too long since my last trip.\\nHave decided to visit sometime during the next month, e.g., optimally, I\\'d like to fly out the last two weeks of September and stay 10 days. Currently looking 2-3 hotels, especially: the Park Hyatt New York, Artezen Hotel and Hampton Inn Financial District. I prefer having a terrace/balcony with table & chairs and a view, if possible, and less particular about the view itself.\\nI am fully vaccinated and have a vaccine card with the correct spelling. If anyone has any thoughts or +/- opinions about any of the hotels I\\'m considering, I\\'d love to hear it. Thanks so much!\\nGlobe Kinda a big jump from the Hampton Inn or Artezen to the Park Hyatt. Thank you for that comment, Red, and, of course, you\\'re right. I made my flight reservations for the end of September and hotel reservations with Sheraton Brooklyn. I like the location of this hotel and have stayed here before, as the location is good (for me).\\nI like picking up snacks at TJ\\'s, walk further up Court Street for spiced hot chocolate at The Chocolate Room, walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to reach downtown Manhattan, meet friends for dinner in Park Slope, etc.\\nI\\'m eager & excited to be back in New York in two weeks! =>\\nEdited: 1:48 am, September 13, 2021 Any suggestions for a Thanksgiving Day meal we can make reservations for? My son and his wife live by Columbia and don\\'t have an oven. My husband, 2 daughters, and I are staying near Times Square in a hotel. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks! Budget/entree? Can we assume turkey & all the trimmings? Maybe $75 a person. Traditional Thanksgiving would be great but open to something else. Thanks! It\\'s likely too early now but in previous years, Jacob\\'s Pickle on the upper west side has had a reasonably priced T\\'giving meal. Thank you. I will look into it. I appreciate your time. Hi! Looking for a great place for brunch (for a Sunday in October) for 2 girl friends. Would love to be able to sit outside, enjoy a bottle or 2 of champagne, some yummy food, and chat. We are staying at the St Regis (so convenient to Central\\nPark South would be amazing!). You don\\'t mention if you have a budget, but The Smith at Second and 51st is pretty close by, and has a varied menu and is not too pricey...is this the type of restaurant you\\'re looking for? https://thesmithrestaurant.com/location/midtown/\\nI also like Amaranth. You may like Fleming by Le Bilboquet - it\\'s a bit of a scene that could be fun. Both are a little pricier.\\nBrunch is usually more fun in more residential neighborhoods, at least too me! I would want to head to Union Square, Meatpacking, Greenwich Village or SoHo, but if you want more walkable suggestions, please advise on budget. In Midtown (west) one of my favourite places is Taboon which has a middle eastern style brunch. They have outdoor seating plus indoors with big windows: https://www.taboon.nyc/menus/#brunch\\nSarabeth\\'s on Central Park South might suit you: https://sarabethsrestaurants.com/locations/central-park-south/menus/\\nIf you wanted to travel to another area in Manhattan, Bar Pisellino in Greenwich Village might suit you, they have wine and cocktails with aperitivo, panini, bomboloni, coffee etc in a very attractive setting.\\nhttps://barpisellino.com/\\nAnother Italian down in TriBeCa is Locande Verde: https://www.locandaverdenyc.com/menus/#brunch I agree Sarabeths on Central Park South might be a good option if being near the park is important.\\nYou might also look into the restaurants in hotels on CPS, like Essex House, Ritz Carlton, Plaza, etc. I don\\'t know what status of their restaurants is but might be worth considering if open and they do brunch.\\nEdited: 7:49 pm, September 12, 2021 La Grande Boucherie\\nhttps://boucherie.nyc/menu/\\nThe Loeb Boathouse is very nice but they don,t take reservations for brunch.

We think the 9/11 memorial & museum would be too much for our son. He enjoys history, harry potter, video games..most things a 9 yr old boy likes :)\\nThank you in advance! This is a pretty good itinerary. Nicely planned geographically.\\nChelsea Market is right under the High Line so while you\\'re there it\\'s a good place to visit. The High Line is not just gardens, there are quirky benches and seats, some interesting art and sculptures, a few food stands, and really nice vistas as you walk along. You might also like to look into Little Island which is also accessible from the High Line and Chelsea.\\nlittleisland.org\\nHudson Yards has the Vessel sculpture but you can only look at that from below at the moment.\\nChinatown and Little Italy are right next to each other. Chinatown is a pretty big area and in the middle of it is Little Italy, several blocks of Italian restaurants. You might as well do both while you\\'re there.\\nThe 9/11 Memorial itself is just nice downward fountains and lots of trees in the area. Your son should be fine with it. It\\'s free to walk around there. The actual museum nearby might be too much for your son though. But you can look at the building and take a peek inside at the steel girders from the old tower. Liberty Park on the southern side of the Memorial is one floor high and sort of overlooks the memorial. Might be worth a quick look.\\nThe Museum of Mathematics might be fun for your son, it\\'s very interactive and hands on.\\nhttps://momath.org/\\nEdited: 5:47 pm, September 12, 2021 Check out this website for kids https://mommypoppins.com/\\nClick on New York City. Good morning,\\nInternational visitor here planning to stop in New York City for a few days on my way to Toronto, Canada where a PCR COVID-19 test is required for entry. Where can I get one done quickly and cheaply in NYC? And what\\'s the process? Contact City MD. Also look at the many previous threads on this subject. I did some research on this, and found one (LabQ) that is free, even to visitors. That seemed too good to be true so I contacted them and this is what they said:\\n\"There is no out-of-pocket cost, regardless of your migration status.\\nThe appointment is not necessary, you can simply walk up to one of the testing locations and get tested right away.\\nUsually, the whole testing process takes about 10-15 minutes.\\nThe turnaround time for the PCR test is from 24 to 36 hours.\"\\nhttps://labq.com/covid/ I used LabQ it is fine. They do the testing out of their vans parked on the streets Wow, thank you everyone! I will definitely check out LabQ. I went to New York City in August. I got a free PCR test at LabQ to get back into Canada. They do warn you that you have to allow 36 hours for the results, I got mine in 14. The van was located at the corner of 57th Street and 6th Avenue (Central Park corner) and I saw another one on 6th Avenue between Rockefeller Center and Bryant Park.\\nYou can fill out the form online before you go or fill it out right there at the van (which is what I did). The service is professional and the document I received and then showed at the airport (LGA and Trudeau) on my phone was accepted without any issues. Can you get tested for free at LabQ even if you don‘t have health insurance? Absolutely, even if you are not American. I am Canadian, didn\\'t have to do anything other than give my information, my email address and my phone number. For the last several days there has been one of those vans on or near the north side of E 50th St just west of corner of 2d Av. I have also seen one around Bloomingdales -- maybe E 59th or E 60th near Lex.\\nYou also ought to be able to get the test for free at a city hospital like Bellevue.\\nEdited: 1:24 pm, September 11, 2021 I hate to have to say this but traveling to the US without any health insurance is fraught with peril. \"You also ought to be able to get the test for free at a city hospital like Bellevue.\"\\nAgree..you should be able to get a free one at any Public Hospital. These are the sites.\\nhttps://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/covid-19-testing-sites/ We’re going to be in NYC in a couple of weeks and will go to the Giants game. Does anyone know what public transportation options will be running to the stadium? I have taken a train from Hoboken before but I think there must be a more direct option offered from the City. Thanks in advance To get to Giants Stadium from NYC you take NJ transit from Penn Station and transfer to the Meadowlands train at Secaucus Junction Thanks. I see there’s a direct bus from Penn Station also but I think the train might still be faster considering traffic. Thoughts? Take the train, the Station is right in front of the Stadium and you wont be stuck in any traffic If you happen to be leaving from Lower Manhattan, taking PATH from the World Trade Center to Hoboken and getting the direct NJ Transit train from there is likely to be simpler and quicker than first getting up to Penn Station, and then taking NJ Transit (which will require a transfer at Secaucus Junction. There is a bus from the Port Authority, but the train is a better method, see what Howard posted in #2. We will be in NYC Sept 22-24, looking at colleges, and have just decided that Priceline Last Minute Deals are not the way to go. Please help us choose a hotel or private rental.\\nWe’d like to keep expenses down and are fine sharing a Queen-sized bed, but we do want a private bathroom. A fridge and coffee maker &/or microwave are nice (but not required). Cleanliness is a must.\\nWe are very flexible on the type of place. My kiddo’s favorite hotel in the world is Costa d’Este in Vero Beach, but we are also fine at someplace nondescript like Hampton Inn. We’ve been happy on trips where we stayed in a spare bedroom with attached bath in the host’s home and in a pension in Garmish. We just need something not too far from where we need to go that’s clean, quiet and comfortable enough for us to get a good night’s sleep.\\nI’m not stating a price range because I don’t want to spend more money than we have to, but also don’t want to wind up someplace moldy because I insisted on a certain $$ limit. We want something “reasonable”, whatever that means there.\\nLooking forward to your suggestions. Looks like the Newton has a room available then. Should I grab it? The Newton is a great choice, not fancy but clean and all rooms have a mini fridge and microwave. There is an express subway stop across the street.\\nJust make sure you are booking a room with a private bathroom, as they have some that are shared. I agree with Mee Mee on all points. Agree re: Newton. Just make sure, when going up to Columbia, to take the uptown local (1 train) to 116th Street and not one of the express trains (2 or 3.) The express trains do not go to Columbia. Well darn it!\\nI booked the Newton for €300 for the 2 nights, the page refreshed, and it showed me the Marcel at Gramercy is available for €244 for the same time. It is being promoted, which makes me a little skeptical, but it is rated a tiny bit higher.\\nIs there any reason not to switch? Reading reviews, I wouldn\\'t switch\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d99382-Reviews-The_Marcel_at_Gramercy-New_York_City_New_York.html My son went to Columbia, we stayed at the Arthouse, Upper West Side. Super convenient to subways to get to Columbia or NYU. it’s also a great place to stay, close to the park, lots of dining and shopping. One of my favorite places to stay. Just answered my own question—the room at the Newton is 4 sq meters bigger. At the scale of these rooms, that makes a difference.

Right column titled “top questions about nyc.” I see the subway mentioned most frequently as an easy way to get to Brooklyn from Manhattan, in order to walk back via the Brooklyn Bridge. Less often do I see mention of taking the ferry from Pier 11 in lower Manhattan to Fulton S/Dumbo terminal. Is there a disadvantage of taking the ferry vs. the subway (such as a longer walk to get to an access point for the bridge?) We will be traveling in early December. And regarding bridge access, exactly how would we access the bridge walkway from the Fulton St/Dumbo terminal? I\\'ve read there\\'s a stairwell access but can\\'t find it on any map. No matter which method you use to get to Dumbo/Brooklyn you\\'ll probably want to walk around the waterfront there and look at the Manhattan view. So from there you\\'d need to walk back up to get to the bridge access point. If you took the subway over, you\\'d have to walk down to the water then walk back up to the bridge stairs (doubling up the walk pretty much). If you took the ferry you\\'d be right at the water and would only have to walk to the bridge stairs when you\\'re ready (less of a walk).\\nThis is a good FAQ on how to get to various points in Dumbo using different subway methods and how to get to the bridge stairs.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k866178-The_Idiot_s_Guide_to_Brooklyn_Brooklyn_Directions_Collected-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThere\\'s really no need for help with the ferry directions. You\\'ll get off the ferry at the Dumbo pier and you\\'ll see the parks and the bridge right there. No explanation needed.\\nI would take the fery over to Dumbo if you wanted less walking. And it\\'s a very nice trip, even in December. The ferries are heated and have big windows.\\nHave google maps with you and you shouldn\\'t have a problem.\\nEdited: 2:16 am, September 10, 2021 Both options are very good to get to where you need to be and what you want to do.\\nMy preference for subway in that case is that I often want to spend time in Brooklyn Heights first, since it\\'s a lovely area, and then walk downhill to DUMBO before entering the bridge. It\\'s called Brooklyn Heights for a reason and walking downhill in that area is easier on my mobility issues than the other way around. We all have our reasons for choosing what works best for us. Ferrying over to DUMBO from Pier 11 and walking back over the Brooklyn Bridge with those spectacular skyline views, especially at sunset, has always been one of the highlights of every NYC visit since 2015. I’ve never considered riding the subway over because I love being on the water, though a short ride, i enjoy the scenery.\\nI visited the Brooklyn Heights area and promenade in April for the first time, I accessed that area walking through Brooklyn Bridge Park.\\nIt’s an easy walk from the DUMBO waterfront area to get to the pedestrian stairway. Have been trying to get to NYC for 18 months now and latest attempt for Feb 2022 also looks doomed at present. As such I have asked the very helpful folk at Hotel Beacon if I could postpone yet again which they have accepted with a nominal date in October 2022 and with additional dollars required as different rate which is fine of course. However in the fine print I did notice a line\\n\" Please note if your reservation dates are on or after September 1st a NYC Sales Tax of 5.85% will apply and it is not reflected on the above confirmation.\"\\nBy my calculations this now brings taxes to about 20% ?\\nWhen you factor in the hopeless exchange rate for $AUD then it would cost close to $3000 USD for 8 nights in a modest hotel - and that is $4000 AUD. Sadly that is too hard to justify for me now\\nOnly hope would be to find cheaper months but Jan/Feb 2023 are blocked out now as have other committments I don\\'t know anything about the tax increase, but the total figure of US $3000 for 8 nights is about $375 a night, taxes included, during what is generally one of the most expensive months of the year in NYC. You won\\'t see realistic hotel rates 13 months in advance. My initial booking was advance pay up front rate and was booked 12 months in advance which is why I got such a good rate.(USD 1610 for 8 nights Feb 2021) Yes I know October is expensive and maybe the quoted price is fair and reasonable for NYC but 20% tax does seem a bit rich. Will keep looking I’m not sure when you booked your initial reservation. From this article I’m sharing it is possible that your reservation many not have included the hotel tax rate. And there’s the chance that by prepaying you did indeed pay the hotel taxes and are now only liable for the rate difference and the tax on that difference. IMO it doesn’t equate to the huge $ difference unless the increased hotel rate is the reason, the tax rate is minimal. I would contact the hotel to get the breakdown of the newly quoted rate explained. https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/05/19/de-blasio-pauses-hotel-tax-for-summer--hoping-to-boost-recovery It isn\\'t a tax increase, it\\'s a reinstatement of the NYC hotel occupancy tax that was suspended for the summer.\\n\"On May 18, 2021, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order that eliminated the 5.875% portion of New York City’s hotel room occupancy tax rate for the three-month period from June 1 to August 31, 2021.\"\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/business-hotel-room-occupancy-tax.page No sure where yourself getting 20%. The city tax, as you note, is 5.85%. The state tax is 8.625%. So that\\'s about $14.5% plus $2/night for \"occupancy tax. So if the room is $250 per night that adds approx $38.25 or about 15%. Is the confirmation itemized?\\nI\\'m inclined to think #5 explains is what is going on I’m of the opinion that hotel Beacon is not a “ modest “ priced hotel. . Too high of nightly price for my budget any month of the year. I do believe CTRH has explained the tax situation. Comparing Feb. rates to Oct. is not helpful. What about March? Are you now committed to using the Beacon? >On May 18, 2021, Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order that eliminated the 5.875% portion of New York City’s hotel room occupancy tax rate for the three-month period from June 1 to August 31, 2021.\"<\\nThis explains it IF your cancelled dates fell in this period. Hello dear New Yorkers,\\nI have been to NYC 2 years ago and i instantly fell in love with this city. Since then I am dreaming of returning back.\\nMy wish is coming to NYC for a stay of around a month. I have done most od sightseeing, now I would like to experience what seems to live in NYC. I am a student so my budget is limited. I wonder what my best possibilities, I would be really keen on some part-time work or student visa. I honestly do not know what are best options for a young foreign for this kind of stay. I would be really thankful of any suggestion.\\nDue to problematic Covid-19 i was thinking of doing this once that things return somehow normal. Anyway I am from Slovenia (European Union) and I have been already fully vaccinated.\\nThank you in advance for any help, I am grateful for all responses I will get I think working may be difficult if you are on a student or visitor visa. I think you need to be on a h-visa or an eligible non-citizen to be able to work, but I could be wrong. Thank you for you response, it was very helpful. I think you should look and see if your school offers an abroad program in NYC or anywhere in the Boston DC, Philadelphia, NYC area- all offer good train services between the major cities. There are certainly valid student visas in the US. They are F-1 vists. The problem is that you must be a student in a US school that has that program. Just saying you are a student now is meaningless. YOu have to actually be a student in the US.\\nYou are only allowed to work on campus, also. There are some possibilities of working off-campus but with very limited eligibility and strict conditions.\\nSo you have to actually be a student. There is no such thing as a student visa anywhere I know of for people who are not actually students in the country where they are going while they are thee, in the US or any other country. US schools aren\\'t cheap, either.And you can\\'t be a student in a US school only for a month. What you want is to be a tourist, only a long stay.\\nNow there are seasonal foreign H2-B visa programs. I don\\'t know the current availability of those, but those are the type of visas foreigners get who may work in ski resorts or summer camps, for example. Or at some summer beach areas. I think the US former President cancelled a lot of those, but I don\\'t know about current situation. I think COVID threw a wrench in that program, also. But of course those I know of aren\\'t in big cities, anyway., they are in resort areas. SOme other companies may hire for seasonal work also, other that amusement parks, ski resorts, etc. Like landscaping companies or seasonal lobstering maybe. In Maryland where I live, they hire them for crab season (not a fun job (seafood processing). Ski resort work isn\\'t that bad, especially if you ski.\\nNow there are schools in NYC where you could apply for a student F1 visa if you were attending probably at least 8 weeks and studying maybe 20 hours a week. Such as English language schools. Now maybe you already know English well and that wouldn\\'t appeal, but something like that.\\nI am not recommending this place at all as I know nothing about it, but this is one example, they have a section about the F1 visa and their tuition seems to be around $600 a month for 20 hrs a week, which isn\\'t too bad.\\nhttps://www.nylanguagecenter.com/programs/\\nNow the problem with those type of schools (or computer or \"business\" schools, etc. geared to foreign students) is I think with the F1 visa you are generally only allowed to work on campus. And those schools don\\'t have jobs. Regular universities do, so that\\'s an issue.\\nI also don\\'t think you can get that visa just be being somewhere for a month.\\nThat\\'s all I know, maybe you can find someone who has done this or knows more, but in short, it is not easy (in any country I know of) for someone to just decide to move there for a month and work during that time. The fact that you are currently a student where you live is irrelevant.\\nEdited: 5:46 pm, September 11, 2021 For a relatively short-term stay of a couple months, you could probably take summer classes without going through the entire admissions process. Take a look at the various CUNY campuses.\\nAbout seasonal visas—the lifeguards at a pool we used to go to in DC were from a company that brought lots of its guards over from Eastern Europe.\\nGood luck! How much time should I allow for uber or taxi from Ludlow in LES to Broadway for a show?\\nShow is 7:30pm and would like to grab a bite before hand in LES Uber can give you a time estimate, with date and time of day. Other apps like Citymapper don the same for a taxi. A local might have a better guess what how long it would take you but I would say 40 minutes?\\nYou must account for variables time , date, Exact starting point and exact ending point. Always plan for more time than you think due to traffic around the theaters & then there is the time you have to wait to get into the theater due to Covid security. You should allow at least 40 minutes, but would strongly encourage you to take the subway. F train from 2nd Ave to 42nd Street-Bryant Park will get you there much faster. Traffic on the LES is generally terrible due to streets that weren\\'t built for cars, and traffic in Times Square is also horrible.\\nDepending on your timing, you could also consider walking - it\\'s about an hour walk but it\\'s a great way to see a lot of NY\\'s character and neighborhoods. So will admit, I’ve never taken the train. Haha. Have been to NYC 15 times or so and never taken a train. Suppose it’s about time to figure it out. Also agree with simply taking the F train to 42nd St.\\nWhen I first read the post, I took Ludlow to mean the street and I was going to suggest catching it at Delancey. If you mean the hotel, the 2nd Ave stop works. Yes, I mean the hotel. Hi All,\\nWe are spending 5 days in New York over Christmas which includes Christmas Day.\\nWe are staying in Fitzpatrick’s Manhattan.\\nJust wondering are there any Irish bars open on Christmas Day in the surrounding areas or any bars open?\\nAlso could anyone recommend any Christmas Day activities.\\nWe have been to New York many times but never for Christmas.\\nAny help would be much appreciated😊 Unfortunately, it\\'s hard to project what this winter will look like yet. We thought Covid would be on the way out, but Delta combined with vaccine resistance meant that this summer wasn\\'t what we thought it would be. We\\'re not in an ideal place as the summer ends and we start heading indoors again.\\nIn normal years, alot shuts down on Christmas Day - and some even a half day on Christmas Eve to give people time for dinner and attending services. I believe the three observation decks (Empire State, Freedom Tower and Top of the Rock) will still be open. If weather is good, Central Park, the Highline or walking the Brooklyn Bridge might be your best options. Movie theaters will be open, as they still cater to non-Christians and those who want to go to get their minds off not being able to get \"home\" to family for the day/week. You could see if any of the three skating rinks will be open, and if Covid doesn\\'t shut them down, shows like the Radio City Music Hall Christmas Spectacular, Nutcracker at the NYC Ballet and any temporary Christmas-themed Broadway shows will probably be running that day - although tickets might be harder to get if there\\'s distanced seating, which I would predict at this point.\\nExpect proof of full vaccination to be necessary to do much of anything indoors. typical christmas activies are seeing the tree, going skating in Rockefeller center, Seeing the holiday store windows) https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12943009-Christmas_Day_2019_in_NYC_What_to_Do_Where_to_Eat-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nAbove is a link to a thread of Christmas Day activities but it is 2 years old due to Covid. Also because of Covid, who knows what will be open this year.\\nAs for bats, the hospitality industry has been hard hit & who knows what will even be in business much less specitically Irish bars. Yes, there will be bars open;one thing you can count on in NYC is open bars.Ask your hotel for directions to those nearest you.\\nNot all performing venues are on Chrustmas day.For instance. Nutcracker is not usually done Christmas day, though they do perform Christmas eve and Dec 26. So best to check ahead with those that interest you. Absent anything beyond reasonable i.e. Covid surge etc. the Bars will be open. Some bars will be open as normal. Some will be closed. Some will open late, after xmas dinner. I hear a lot of jokes about the NYC area airports and I wonder how true the jokes are (Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers make New York airport jokes often, I think). Which airport is your favorite and why? How do you prefer to get back to the city --- Uber, Taxi, Towncar, kind and helpful friend?\\nI see that JFK has a flat fare for taxis to the city at bout $57. How much on average is a taxi from LGA to the city? To where in the city? See? There is no one size fits all., because the cost changes depending on where you are going from LGA/time etc. What airport works best is going to vary based on the person so the only question is what airport works best for you.\\nEdited: 4:33 pm, September 09, 2021 We usually fly into LGA because there are nonstop flights.\\nA taxi from JFK to Manhattan will end up being about $75.\\nFrom LGA, a taxi will be on the meter, so the price varies by traffic. I\\'d guesstimate about $40-$45. I actually like Newark or JFK . But if LaGuardia had a cheaper flight I would take it.\\nWhat I really want is a nonstop flight I’ll take any airport. I forgot to add that my destination is 6th avenue and 17th street. Most people don\\'t base their decision on the airport itself. They look at flight times and flight costs and availability first and then if all else is equal they start looking at airports that may be a bit closer to their destination. Between the three I am hard pressed to understand what real difference it makes beyond the factors I have mentioned when you are talking about arrivals. You are literally walking off a plane and leaving the airport. I could understand maybe departures especially if someone was going to have to spend time at the airport, had access to specific lounges etc then maybe those could be additional factors but for arrivals it really is irrelevant. The airports don\\'t differ that much among each other in terms of quality. \"I forgot to add that my destination is 6th avenue and 17th street.\" If you are asking because you are trying to figure out what airport to use I would look at flight schedules/costs first. Then if that is all about equal I would look further into it. For example, if you know you want to take a taxi I would use LGA. if all else was equal since it will be cheaper cab for you than from other airports. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13187699-How_do_I_get_from_the_airport_JFK_LGA_EWR_to_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThis is one of the best post I’ve ever seen describing getting to and from the all the airports.\\nHighly suggest you read it all.\\nPS the airporter Golden touch bus is not running at this time. Last I heard.\\nEdited: 4:47 pm, September 09, 2021 Maybe I\\'m wrong, but I doubt most people think much about a \"favorite\" airport.\\nAnd yes, add Newark into the mix. JFK is much further from Manhattan. LGA from Toronto flying has been perfect for 8 trips\\nI always fly on an 8:00 flight or earlier and I have avoided any weather that can crop up….\\nI have used communal shuttle…cheaper and they drop other hotel people off and I’ve used carmel cab…all good Thank you so much, CaminoMundo!!! That is great information!! Finally getting around to writing my first trip report. Seems fitting, since it was my first solo trip!\\nDay 1-flights were a breeze, and arrived at LGA on time, and quickly got an Uber (from plane to car in less than 20 min-love the new LGA layout!). Easy trip to the hotel to drop my bags and hit the ground running! Headed towards 3rd Ave, and just started walking up towards Times Square. Stopped for a late lunch at the Halal Guys, and then on to Times Square for some sightseeing. Kinda bummed to see the red steps were closed off, so no sitting to just take in the sights and sounds, but nonetheless still a great welcome to the city. After leaving TS, headed down towards 34th St, and found a Target to grab some band-aids and a water. Wandered around for a while to cool off, and then over to the High Line. Jumped off to grab a pic at Kleinfeld\\'s, and then down to Chelsea Market and Starbucks Reserve for a snack. By this time, my feet were angry at me, so I slowed down for a bit while I made my way towards the Friends Apt and Ghostbusters Firehouse. The overcast skies made for some great skyscraper views as they peeked in and out of the clouds! Finally made my way to Vesey St for the Van Gogh Immersive exhibit, only to realize that I was an hour early! So I wandered around the Irish Hunger Memorial, and then found a bench to sit and watch the ferries come and go. Had a great view of the Statue of Liberty, so that was also a plus. Thankfully, the hour passed fairly quickly, and soon enough it was time for me to go in to the exhibit. I enjoyed it more than I expected, considering how tired I was! It was very informative, and the area with the 360 views was well worth the wait! After I left, I headed to grab dinner. By this time, I had been awake for almost 20 hours, with only about 3 hrs of sleep, so I wasn\\'t picky! Ran into Shake Shack, and bought a subway pass, and headed back to my hotel. Ended the day with a little over 31,000 steps, according to my Apple Watch!\\nThis post is long enough-I\\'ll add each day as a separate comment. if you\\'ve read this far, kudos to you! Day 2,\\nStarted out the day with breakfast at Dominique Ansel Workshop-the breakfast sandwich is delicious!!! Enjoyed an iced coffee while I wandered around towards the Flatiron Building. Snapped a few pics, and made my way up towards MOMA. I was a little early, so I stopped in at St Patrick\\'s for a few minutes. No matter how many times I see it, it still takes my breath away when I walk in the doors. Made it to MOMA, and I was still a little early, so I joined the line, and enjoyed chatting with a local for a little bit until the museum opened. I was immediately reminded why this is my favorite museum in the city, and enjoyed a very relaxing couple of hours. The Cezanne drawing exhibit was beautiful, and the Automania exhibit was interesting. After taking in the galleries and seeing my favorites, I headed out to grab lunch. Grabbed a couple slices of pizza at 2 Bros, and then mad a last minute decision to go up to the Top of the Rock. So glad I did-it turned out to be a beautiful day, and I got some great photos. It was so interesting to see how the vantage points changed with each level of the observation decks! Then I headed up to the Guggenheim, and unfortunately, I felt like this was a wasted $25, as I was very unimpressed overall. I was disappointed, because I was so looking forward to seeing something new. I was in and out in less than an hour. Glad I went, but unless there\\'s a specific exhibit I\\'m interested in, I don\\'t know if I\\'ll go back again. With some time to kill before dinner, I headed back to the hotel for a power nap and woke up refreshed and ready for the evening. After a great dinner at Momofuku Noodle Bar, I headed back down towards Times Square to the Showstoppers exhibit. It ended up being smaller than I expected, but I loved it! With no Broadway shows to see this trip, it filled that void, and it was so fun to see the costumes that up close and personal I highly recommend it for any Broadway fan. Decided it was time to head back to the hotel, and call it a night. Stopped at Magnolia Bakery for dessert, and had the best bowl of banana pudding I\\'ve ever had! And that\\'s saying a lot, coming from a girl born and raised in the South! Step count for the day-36,899 (almost 15 miles)\\nEdited: 9:25 pm, September 09, 2021 Day 3-up and going for my last full day in the city. The days go by entirely too fast! Left the hotel around 9am, and had a reservation at Tiffany\\'s to get my jewelry cleaned. It looked like it was about to rain, and I was in a hurry, so I grabbed an Uber to the UWS to get to brunch at Jacob\\'s Pickles. This has become one of my favorite restaurants, and I was not disappointed! The Bloody Mary and biscuits and gravy were the perfect start to my day! Walked across Central Park to the Met (stopped to rest my feet a few times-back to back to back days of walking were beginning to get to me!). Made it to the Met with a few minutes to spare before my timed entry, so I rested on the steps and watched the fountains and enjoyed the people watching for a bit. At this point, every step was becoming more and more painful, so I had a quicker than usual visit-saw what I came to see, but didn\\'t spend as much time as I had planned. Slowly made my way back down towards midtown to do a little retail therapy at Tiffany\\'s since I didn\\'t have time earlier in the morning. With nothing else really planned for the day, I took the subway back to Grand Central and went back to the hotel to rest my legs. My knee was beginning to hurt, so a couple of Aleve and a nap were in order. Got up and planned to go get dinner somewhere and go to the Friends Experience, but when I woke up, my knee and feet were just not having it so I aborted the plan, just ordered Uber Eats at the hotel, and called it a night. Step count for day 3-22,002 Day 4-last day-never fun to leave! Got up and got mostly packed, and walked up to Ess-A-Bagel to get breakfast. Came back to the hotel to finish packing, and before I knew it, it was time to head to the airport.\\nEnded up doing a few things I hadn\\'t had planned, and didn\\'t get nearly everything in that I wanted to, but I couldn\\'t have asked for a better trip, sore feet/aching knees and all! The hotel was great-after having to change from my original hotel, I think the Hampton Inn Grad Central ended up being the perfect choice! I\\'d definitely stay there again. Already planning my next trip for Jan/Feb 2022. Anyone know when the official dates for Broadway Week will be posted? I\\'ve got my to do list started! thanks for a great trip report! That’s awesome, Tamara, thank you for sharing. Omg, what a lot of walking, no wonder the feet were tired! Loved your trip report!! Visiting the Ghostbuster’s House is now on my list. Thank you for sharing! Great trip report! TN girl here also! Thanks for sharing! Looking so forward to being there myself! I\\'ve have to purchase my museum tickets. Wow you really covered a lot of ground! Good for you! Thanks for the report. Best banana pudding you’ve ever had at magnolia bakery! that alone makes it sound like a successful trip.🙂 Your lunch at Jacob’s pickles sounded really good. I may have to try that place after reading your report . I’ve been meaning to.\\nNice to hear you like the Hampton Inn Grand Central. I like that hotel too I think that location is perfect it’s a little away from everything ,quiet but still in the thick of it at the same time.\\nI enjoy the way you just spontaneously did whatever you wanted to do with a few exceptions.

A $2 billion price tag means only 6000 people will take this train to get to that figure??? \"Reinvent Albany said it expects that the AirTrain project will carry fewer than 6,000 net transit trips a day.\"\\nThey\\'re apparently decreasing the number of users by using \"net\" transit trips per day as the divisor. Seems like that is meant to eliminate the riders who currently use mass transit (i.e. the bus / subway combo). Of course dividing by a smaller number will result in a larger unit cost.\\nBut conceptually the basic premise of their calculation is wrong because they\\'re dividing by the number of trips PER SINGLE DAY to get cost per RIDER (not cost per ride). If you had a commuter service you could make a case that more or less the same 6,000 were making daily trips. That doesn\\'t hold true for airport transit. Some of the riders will be airport workers, but many (most?) probably currently use mass transit and are already being eliminated by using \"net\" trips in the calculation. There will be frequent fliers, but I very much doubt that the majority of new users of the airtrain will be DAILY riders.\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily more meaningful to calculate unit cost based on how many unique individuals will use the service as opposed to, say, how many car / taxi rides will be eliminated.\\nEither way the number of unique airtrain riders (even new-to-mass-transit riders) will surely be many, many times greater than 6,000.\\nIt\\'s fundamentally an invalid nonsense number. I saw a promotion for the LGA Air Train that showed the yet to open East Side Access station under Grand Central with a train parked there emblazoned with \"Laguardia Express.\" The current problem is that the Port Washington line that serves Mets/Willets Point Blvd. (and Flushing) runs only every half hour, or less, for much of the day. No one is going to wait so long if they miss the train for the 20 min. ride. If there was a way to loop the LIRR tracks around Citi Field and over the knot of expressways to reach LGA and have a frequent shuttle service, Air Train might be a success. Given the limited turning radius and slope of regular train tracks, this might not be possible. While I\\'m inclined to agree the math in that article may be a case of what my Grandma would have called \"figures don\\'t lie but liars can figure\" there are multiple reasons the project is of questionable utility\\nIt was recently discussed here https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13617102-LaGuardia_AirTrain_gets_FAA_OK_to_start_construction-New_York_City_New_York.html and here https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13647391-AirTrain_projects_at_LaGuardia_Newark_advance-New_York_City_New_York.html You have to understand there is a group of people led by a former Bar Maid who dont want to build anything in Queens except free housing and Bike Lanes. They dont want money being spent on the airports because they claim air travel is not evinmentally sound.\\nThey claim the extension of the Astoria line is a better option and it is a better option, except Nimby killed that plan so its really not feasible to do that.\\nCosts to do anything in NYC is expensive, there is an abandoned LIRR line from Ozone Park to Rego Park, there was talk of reviving this line partially for JFK service. The right of way is there, basically you have to put the tracks back and rebuild the bridges. It was found to cost $6 billion to connect this line to the LIRR and $8 billion to connect to the Subway in Rego Park (Building a tunnel under queens blvd to do so) #6 - While I have mixed feelings about AOC, I think there are good reasons to question the process around this project https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-edit-lga-airtrain-faa-20210412-i6t7b5js65e2pedhkwsnkorola-story.html\\nAre you in AOC\\'s district? If yes, what did you think about the 2X/week \"AOC is bad\" election junk mail from her opponent that **never mentioned his Republican party affiliation** or ever said anything substantive about alternative policy positions? I am not in AOC\\'s distict, I am thankfully in Meng\\'s district. She is a 1000 x better representative\\nAOC\\'s district is of course fairly close to my house and I am in her district almost once a week at least.\\n(For the record I dont belvie Meng supports the Airtrain either)\\nUntil the opponents of the Airtrain come up with a viable plan that will begin construction, they are talking nonsense\\nBTW The N train extension is actually fairly useless to most Queens residents , Its not easy to connect to the N train . if I had to connect to the N train Id have to take 3 train to do so. The N only connects to the rest of Queens at the Queesboro Plaza station to the 7 train It does not connect to the Queens Blvd line (E, F train) #8 - Bus lanes\\nI don\\'t give a rodents derriere about those who won\\'t use buses because of some perceived (presumably low class?) \"stigma\" they might think buses have You might not care about people who wont use buses , so they will use taxis and Ubers instead and jam up the highways . The Van Wyck is a giant Parking lot. Gosh I hate driving on it and the Grand Central isnt any better I am so excited to see the return of trip reports! Thank you to those who posted so far!\\nFor anyone visiting this weekend, I am thrilled by the return of Art Fairs. Yesterday, I went to the Armory Show with a friend. It is at the Javits Center this year instead of Pier 92-94. There are fewer exhibitors, but it is very well spaced out, with wide walkways to allow for bigger crowds (although it wasn\\'t too crowded yesterday). I enjoyed the shift in style of art, we are in an exciting time for art lovers. The appetite for new art has only increased - many galleries reported that most of the words were sold. https://www.thearmoryshow.com/info/visit\\nToday, I went to the Independent Art Fair in the Battery Maritime Building - such a beautiful building and a great place to see art. My friend and I agreed that much of it was a bit twisted. Intriguing, interesting. With very chatty gallerists. And then cocktails by Cipriani (Bellinis!!) on the Veranda afterwards as the sun set. Such a perfect night! https://www.newyorklatinculture.com/independent-art-fair-2021/\\nI believe both fairs go through Sunday - hurry up! Thank you Risa. It sounds amazing. Its good to see such events returning. NYC was and remains to be the culture capital of the US and one of them in the world Sounds like a great time. A while ago, before the pandemic, Oakland, CA has some art Friday’s where a couple of blocks are filled with pop up art shows and plenty of wine and appetizers.\\nLooking forward to hearing more of your trip/outing reports. Thanks all.\\nZtaks, I especially hope you get there - I think you will have a lot to say about it (perhaps not on this site, though)\\nThanks travelchick - I am doing some very special things shortly but haven’t decided what I can say here - people tend to misread things. This landed in my inbox, if anyone is interested. I\\'d love to see it, but there won\\'t be a visit to the city during its run.\\nBrooklyn Museum\\nOpens September 10, 2021\\nIn the decades after World War II, Christian Dior became one of the world’s most recognized names in fashion. Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams explores the history of the House of Dior, bringing to life Dior\\'s many sources of inspiration—from the splendor of flowers and other natural forms to classical and contemporary art.\\nWith objects drawn primarily from the Dior archives, the exhibition presents a wide array of over two hundred haute couture garments as well as photographs, archival videos, sketches, vintage perfume elements, and accessories, and features works from the Museum’s collection. The haute couture on view exemplifies the French couturier’s fabled silhouettes, including his groundbreaking “New Look,” which debuted in 1947.\\nPresented are galleries devoted to the years that Dior, as well as his six successors, each designed at the House of Dior, followed by eighteenth-century-inspired gowns, a “colorama” display of Dior accessories, and a gallery of toiles (the full-scale, 3-D mockups used to confirm finished designs) showcasing the dressmaking process. The central atrium of our Beaux-Arts Court has been redesigned as an enchanted garden, and a concluding gallery celebrates dresses worn by stars from Grace Kelly to Jennifer Lawrence.\\nAdmission to Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams includes General Admission but does not include The Obama Portraits Tour (closing October 24) or Andy Warhol: Revelation (opening November 19), which each require a separate ticket.\\nAll visitors 12 and older must show proof of vaccination and a valid I.D. Masks are required regardless of vaccination status. I was actually considering going to this..... Oh, please do! And post about it here so people like me who can\\'t go can enjoy the experience through your eyes. :) If its anything like what was shown in London in 2019, it is a MUST for fashion/art lovers. Just the setup of the Exhibit was stunning. The collection of vintage clothing and the workmanship involved is breathtaking.\\nI ordered the book as a memento and worth it. I thought it might be the same one I saw at the McCord Museum in Montreal, however, as it is extended to September 26, 2021 it must be different pieces. I was actually living in Brooklyn at the time and saw the events unfold. Still fresh in my memory. Sure many of you have memories as well of where you were and how things have changed in the city since then. This one of the simplest and yet so poignant commemorations to the victims of 9/11 in NYC. And 20 years on the whole world still remembers and observes and respects, like it was yesterday.\\nNever forget. RIP.\\nhttps://abc7ny.com/tribute-in-light-twin-towers-world-trade-center-wtc/1507591/ And a good article on some facts about the One World Trade Center.\\nhttps://untappedcities.com/2021/09/10/secrets-one-world-trade-center/?displayall=true\\nI don\\'t think they mentioned it, but the 8 sides of that building represent the 8 sides of the 2 towers that fell, 4 sides on each of the old towers. Very insightful design. Visitors will be transported into the vibrant world of legendary street photographer and fashion historian Bill Cunningham at an immersive installation opening in The Seaport on September 12 during New York Fashion Week.\\nLaunching September 12 and running for eight weeks through October 30, Experience The Times of Bill Cunningham is located at Live Rocket Studios, 26 Fulton Street, New York. Admission is $30. Tickets may be purchased online at timesofbill.com.\\nMore info:\\nhttps://www.6sqft.com/new-exhibit-on-nyc-photographer-bill-cunningham-to-open-during-new-york-fashion-week/\\nhttps://gothamtogo.com/experience-the-times-of-bill-cunningham-opening-at-the-seaport-during-new-york-fashion-week/\\nhttps://wwd.com/business-news/media/bill-cunningham-exhibition-to-open-during-new-york-fashion-week-1234903869/#! Sounds great! A shame that it will only run for eight weeks though. I really loved the stories I\\'ve heard of Bill Cunningham, going to see where I can fit this in. Thank you for sharing! My apologies, the third link in my OP did not quite work. Here\\'s a shorter version:\\ntinyurl.com/ss3mhtex I am in NYC every 3 or 4 weeks. I noticed that my metro card has expired. I have quite a bit of money left on it. What can I do? If you put it into a a regular machine buying kiosk in any station it will tell you that your card has expired and ask if you if you want to replace it. Click yes and it will transfer your balance and spit out a new card :) If expired less than a year (as per the date on the back of the card) you can transfer any remaining money to a new card at a MetroCard Vending machine (IIRC there is no charge for the new card)\\nhttps://new.mta.info/fares/metrocard-help I can vouch for the above as we did just this in a machine over the Labor Day weekend I have decided on our itinerary so the hotel selection begins. First, it will be my husband and me, both in late 50\\'s and it\\'s our first visit. Decided since it is the first visit we want to stay in Manhattan, we don\\'t really mind the noise for this short trip.\\nMay 4 - 8, 2022\\nBudget per night including taxes $300 - $400.00 a night.\\nPlan to walk and use transit to get to the places we want to see\\nWhat hotels do you suggest? I always appreciate the knowledge that is provided here. Luxury or what type of hotel and where in Manhattan? Manhattan is a big area with lots of different neighbourhoods and vibes.\\nMost first timers like Midtown because it\\'s where a lot of the popular sights are, and Central Park is not far from most Midtown hotels, and if you don\\'t mind the noise and crowds it would probably suit you well.\\nYou could get downtown to see the sights such as the Statue of LIberty and 9/11 Memorial and Brooklyn Bridge with a subway ride.\\nMay 2022 is still a fair way away so hotel availability and nightly rates might not be 100% accurate right now. However, you might find a good bargain this far out.\\nHave you searched for anything at all yet? If not, take a look at something like booking.com where you can put in your dates and preferred budget and see what comes up. Try Midtown as the location for a start. Any hotels you like the look of we can help with opinions, and you can also look at reviews here on TA by other guests.\\nThis far out, don\\'t make a non-refundable reservation. You will likely change your mind a couple of times by the time May 2022 comes around. Hello. I have always been moved by 9/11 and I would like to visit NYC for the weekend coming up for the 20yr remembrance. Is it too crowded during 9/11 weekend for a visit. Will there be rememberence ceremony for general public or is everything private?\\nAlso I was told that the crime in NYC (Manhattan) has gotten bad as of late. Is this true? Mostly private activities for the families at the WTC site.\\nNYC crime rates have moved similarly to those of most major cities in the past 2 years. As long as you are cautious as you always would be in a large city, you will be fine. There will be an overwhelming police and security presence in NYC around 9/11. I would be much more worried visiting other cities in the US than I am about NY. You aren\\'t going to be able to go to the ceremony at the world trade center or even get close to it most likely. That is for families etc and crowds are reduced due to the pandemic. Some other events are listed below.\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/arts/nyc-911-events.html NYC is huge. There will be many places in the city where it won\\'t be apparent that the ceremonies are taking place. NYC is never too crowded for a visit.\\nCome, pay your respects and enjoy the city. Oh yea the nyc being too crowded question isn\\'t really a legitimate concern ever when it comes to NYC. It\\'s a massive city. Crowds are down significantly with people working from home etc. Trinity Wall Street is observing the anniversary with a series of events centered around \"for A Time and Space for Remembrance and Healing\", a 48 hour vigil held at St Paul\\'s Chapel.\\nhttps://trinitywallstreet.org/september-11\\n\"St. Paul’s Chapel will be open to all those who are seeking a place to pray, reflect, mourn, or simply sit with their memories. Clergy from the Episcopal Diocese of New York will be present to offer support and prayers, and from 7am-7pm on Saturday, brief musical interludes and readings will be offered on the hour. Masks and social distancing will be required and capacity limits observed.\\nAn exhibit displaying artifacts from the events of Sep. 11 will be available at St. Paul’s Chapel.\"\\n\"visitors can also share prayers, names and remembrances on white ribbons and tie them to the fences and trees of St. Paul\\'s Chapel to honor loved ones and those who served unselfishly 20 years ago.\"\\nThe role of St. Paul’s Chapel in the aftermath of 9/11:\\nhttps://trinitywallstreet.org/visit/st-pauls-chapel/911 I haven\\'t checked but imagine many churches and other houses of worship will either be having special services or observing this anniversary as part of normal services.\\nAlso note some 9/11 families observe the anniversary at other memorials that were built in communities that were particularly hard hit on 9/11 -- places like Staten Island, Middletown NJ and I think Breezy Point or somewhere thereabouts.. If you want to actively participate in a service, you might consider going to one of these as an alternative to the one down at the WTC site.\\nAlso keep in mind that a fair number of New Yorkers don\\'t particularly like being reminded of this date and some go out of their way to get out of town. There are many ways you can commemorate and be involved, from attending special musical performances to viewing special museum exhibits to joining in community observances to paying your own respects in your own way.\\nThe 9/11 Memorial and Museum has a good list of what will be on: https://www.911memorial.org/20th-anniversary/september-11-2001-commemoration\\nSome are only on on the actual September 11 day, others will go for a few days. Look at the \"Citywide Commemorations\" ***NYC crime rates have moved similarly to those of most major cities in the past 2 years. As long as you are cautious as you always would be in a large city, you will be fine.***\\nRecent statistics show overall crime down, but hate crimes continue to skyrocket:\\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/overall-crime-down-in-nyc-but-hate-crimes-still-soaring/ar-AAOcavw\\nI do agree about being cautious, always be aware of your surroundings. Just saw the MTA opened up an underground pedestrian tunnel connected the bryant park subway station to the times square subway station. I\\'m sure people are making good use of it today with the rain. Thank you for sharing. Hopefully it won’t turn into one large homeless shelter- kinda defeating it purpose ( which is great) Previous such tunnels have shown to be a problem. there is a tunnel down 6th Ave from 34to 40th St, that was closed because of crime and a tunnel from 34th and 7th Penn Station to 6th And 34th Umm if they can\\'t figure out how to keep people safe in the tunnels then the city really is run by incompetents. Other systems all over the world are able to do it just fine. Here is a quick article on the 6th Ave tunnel\\nhttps://viewing.nyc/peek-inside-the-abandoned-underground-tunnel-connecting-35th-and-40th-streets-along-6th-ave/ this is a NY Post article on the Gimblels tunnel which ran from Penn Station to Gimbels (Now the Manhattan mall)\\nhttps://nypost.com/2010/11/28/remembering-the-gimbels-tunnel/ It was closed in 1991. The city has changed quite a bit since then and we have thngs like surveillance cameras now. I\\'m sure in the 30 years since that tunnel was closed the city has come up with some idea about how to properly police such a tunnel. The 80s and early 90s it could get sketchy just walking down certain streets at night let alone a tunnel. We don\\'t live in that type of environment anymore thankfully. Looking forward to the suggestions on where the homeless SHOULD go The homeless are a complex problem because the vast majority of them suffer from mental illness and/or alcohol/drug dependencies.\\nWe\\'ve seen that so many of the unprovoked attacks in recent times have been from mentally unstable homeless people.\\nThere is no easy answer, but what is being done, or not being done now is clearly not working. We have spent most of our tourist visits to NYC staying on the UWS..... a month in 2012 and then several short visits since then.... we figure we need a new spot..... been looking for a hotel in either Tribeca or SoHo that won\\'t break the bank and has king bed or 2 queens.... staying a week in November.... thanks for any tips..... have some points with Marriott to use as well.... As with all hotel requests, you need to define what \"won\\'t break the bank\" means to you. Also, list your exact dates. We will arrive on the second Monday in November and stay a week..... many hotels seem to add that RESORT fee and then with taxes it adds up so quickly.... I\\'ve been trying to find hotels that list their rates as $200 a night before all those fees get added..... thanks for any assistance..... We usually stay at the Sheraton Tribeca, were there this past week. No resort fees, they have King Beds, and if you are Platinum they have a great lounge and roofdeck. Very convenient to subway\\nFurther downtown is the Downtown Marriott, we stayed there in July and really liked it. No resort fee there, either. A bit less convenient to the subway, but not bad and right near the WTC Memorial Look at The Frederick in Tribeca. I think they may have resort fees, but the location is excellent. Prices fluctuate a lot by date, so if it fits. your budget I don\\'t know. Additionally, look at the Walker hotel Tribeca- the rooms tend to be small here but it’s in a good location.\\nFor some reason I’ve seen some low rates there lately @ approx $200.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d15327417-Reviews-Walker_Hotel_Tribeca-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThe Solita Soho Hotel in Little Italy on grand Street is most likely in budget. It’s close to Soho.\\nWyndham Garden Chinatown. It’s a nice hotel close -ish Soho/tribeca and it has good views with floor ceiling windows.\\nEdited: 11:27 am, September 09, 2021 Four Points Soho is an option. If you’re willing to stay in the financial district, the AC Downtown which is a Marriott brand is relatively new and within budget. The Artezen hotel in Fidi has become a forum favorite and within your budget. “ Following the most up-to-date health guidelines, the City of New York will manage public viewing locations and safety procedures along designated portions of the route with access details to be announced.”\\nhttps://abc7ny.com/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-macys-2021-macy/11008322/ Thanks for the info, My appetite has gone down drastically since I last visited NYC, and now I no longer eat large or heavy meals as they can negatively impact my energy levels, focus, etc.\\nI want to make every bite count (so trying to avoid any fast food, except for Dunkin) so here are my must try eats that represent the diversity of the city. What are some must tries in your opinion? I’ve already had Katz’ and giant pretzel and NYC hot dog on prior trip.\\n1. Slice of pizza\\n2. Lox bagel\\n3. Challah French toast\\n4. Dominican food\\n5. African food\\n6. Russ & Daughters\\n7. PB&J fried chicken (sounds weird & good at the same time)\\n8. Bodega salad bar food (if available)\\n9. Coffee cart coffee\\n10. Dunkin iced coffee\\n11. Jewish food (maybe a smoked fish?)\\n12. Halal cart chicken Smoked fish could be considered Jewish food but you already have lic. You are missing the Jewish-style meat such as pastrami or corned beef and the obligatory 1/2 sour pickles.\\nProblem is the sandwiches can be huge. However, I found the 1/2 sandwich and soup at Sarge\\'s Deli on 3rd Ave, sound 37th, I think, to be a bit more manageable.\\nhttps://sargesdeli.com/assets/uploads_general/Dine-In-Menu-01-18.pdf\\nEdited: 10:38 am, September 08, 2021 @forgotmypword That sounds delicious!! I think I will get a corned beef sandwich and have half for lunch and half for dinner. Close to your hotel for starters:\\n1). Try Joe’s on 14th St. at 3rd Ave. This is classic NY Style pizza.\\n2). Try Murray’s on 6th Ave, between 12th and 13th St. Thank you, SpringerAndy!! I will check them out. I am looking for a nice thin slice of NYC style pizza, just cheese, or maybe pesto. I miss pepperoni. Lol! There are pizzerias throughout the city. @Ter -- I plan to have quite a few slices of pizza while there. :) >>> I think I will get a corned beef sandwich and have half for lunch and half for dinner.<<<\\nYour choice, but (a) it won’t be nearly as good cold and (b) with some rather ambitious eating goals, why have the same meal twice? My unsolicited advice: if a half sandwich is on offer, take it. A falafel sandwich. If you\\'re near one of the Nish Nush locations, go for it. But there are many other places as well dpending on where you are. You can get a bagel & lox at Russ & daughters. They also do French toast made with babka ( a type of bready cake). I\\'d try Clinton St. Baking Co. for French toast. Shopshin\\'s makes French toast with bread pudding. What do you mean by \"Jewish Food\"\\nStuff like Lox is not a staple in the jewish Neighborhoods, Neither is Deli. In fact the biggest jewish Neighborhood in NYC has neither a real Deli or a place to get fresh Lox (Honeslty other than Zabars or Russ And Daughters, I dont really know where to get it, If I want it I get the pre-packeaged ones) I see it’s open again….but do u have to make a reservation\\nTo stand there so they can keep the spacing good?\\nI thought I’d seen a link earlier in summer but can’t find it…thanks\\nI maybe in town in early November Thanks but they have all info but not booking place even though they allude to it….I’m using an iPhone not computer thanks I read the link in #1 and saw no reference at all to booking. It mentions a security checkpoint as well as check-in, which I assume is when / where vaccination status is checked. Nothing about reservations or booking. Yes true…but a month ago there was a calendar with dates to pick like the shows…and I can’t find site…wonder if because summer series over they don’t do calendar? But then they would say first come first stand…. Greetings.... after missing NYC for several years my husband and I are planning a week\\'s visit in November..... we\\'ve enjoyed photos of the Occulus, but wonder if being in that area there are other things to see and do.... has the inside developed? We are staying in the SoHo area and hope to see some of the newer additions to the city.... I\\'ve been to Hudson Yards and the Vessel but my husband has not..... we\\'ll try for a play and some museums we have not seen as well.... thanks in advance.... Certainly go inside the Occulus. There are stores in there and it connects on to Brookfield place with more stores. If you are looking for other things to do in the area beyond the 9/11 memorial/museum/freedom tower, wall street is not too far of a walk with trinity church, stock exchange, federal hall, etc. Van gogh virtual exhibit is a bit west near the water. You could easily explore southern manhattan if you are ok with a bit of walking. Here is info on Downtown https://downtownny.com/explore/plan-your-trip/itineraries-trip-ideas/ While there are stores in the Oculus, many of them are empty and it’s not a destination shopping kind of place. Retail in general in New York has taken a hit, and while it’s slowly coming back in some areas, you will see a lot of empty stores downtown. Besides the inside of the Oculus itself, there are two connected aisles of stores, and Eataly in Tower Four which is connected by the shopping aisles.\\nThe concourse that connects to Brookfield Place was intended to focus on food places, but a lot of them are empty. There is a farmer’s market on the plaza on Tuesdays and a Smorgasbord on Fridays until 10/29.\\nFront Street at the Seaport and Pier 17 are probably better food areas. The Hudson River greenway is a terrific place to spend a few hours. Lots of parks on the piers and interesting art and memorials. The area from Canal Street all the way to the southern trip is fascinating In case you are not aware, the Vessel is closed following several jumpers. It will likely require some major alterations. No public access I am aware of but on my last trip in November 2019 I stayed at the Millennium Hilton across the street from the Occulus. My view of it looking down from my 25th floor room’s wall of windows was stunning. Like most great architecture not everyone likes it, I think it’s beautiful and the inspiration behind it is nice.\\nI highly suggest going inside to see it that way too. It was just starting to fill up on my last trip, I hope it’s not completely emptied. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 5:44 pm, September 09, 2021 There is stuff to see in the Occulus.

I assume you realize the Oculus is in the financial district and there are many more hotels there, some very new. Are you considering staying down there as well? If you go into the Oculus, try and take a walk up to Eataly on the 3rd floor of WTC4 (connectable from within the Oculus). Lots of Italian goods in there including fresh foods, pre-packaged goods, pizza, pasta, salads, coffee, chocolates.\\nThe restaurants on the west side of Eataly have a view over the 9/11 Memorial.\\nIf you just want to go in there without walking the maze of mall within the Oculus, the address is Liberty St at Church St. Just go up the escalators there to the 3rd floor.\\nEdited: 5:56 pm, September 09, 2021 Hello! I’m a girl from Italy. I’m writing to you because I wanted to ask you some help: I have my departure for USA on Oct 1. I was vaccinated with Astrazeneca, both doses. I’ll go live there, an hour away from NYC so of course I planned to stay a lot of time there. But now, from Sept 13th, Excelsior Pass it will be mandatory for inside restaurants, gym ecc. I can’t download it because it’s only for FDA vaccines. So basically, I’m unvaccinated for NY State! I mean, I can’t do again my shots and at the same time I really need this Pass, just to eat inside/go to events ecc. Please, someone could help me with this struggle? Are in my same situation? Thanks Proof of being vaccinated by a CDC or WHO approved vaccine is what is required. The Excelsior Pass is only one form of such proof. It is not available to you if you aren’t a New Yorker or vaccinated in NY. However, other forms of proof are acceptable, including a copy of your vaccine card. Please read this carefully. https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page Thanks for this reply.\\nI think a lot of people are going to be having this same worry in the next few months,\\nMillions have been vaccinated with AstraZeneca but as it is not currently FDA approved a lot of people are worried about whether they will still be classed as being fully vaccinated in New York. I wasn\\'t aware that WHO approved vaccines were also OK so thanks again The language linked refers to \"official immunization record from ... outside the US.\" So you are just going to have to bring that and hope it is understood. They don\\'t specify it has to be in English or any other language. If it is a digital pass with a code, am not sure that will be understood here, so might be good to have something on paper. Also. I would expect you to have difficulty getting your Italian or EU proof accepted here, at least initially, as the people doing the checking will likely not be familiar with it. They are trained to look at CDC cards and the Excelsior and NYC passes; haven\\'t had to deal with proof from outside US yet.You might want to print out copy of NY rule to show them if they don\\'t know about proof from.other countries.\\nEdited: 12:30 pm, September 09, 2021 Under NYC law, Astrazeneca is an accepted vaccine: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/keytonyc-vaccine-list.pdf\\nI would get an the NYC Covid-safe app before you come if possible: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page (I realize Risa already provided this link).\\nEdited: 12:38 pm, September 09, 2021 AstraZeneca is officially an accepted vaccine here, but I think a lot of people currently doing checking at movies, stadiums, restaurants, etc will not know that, nor will they understand something written in Italian. However, I agree that if she can take photo and get it on NYC Pass that would help as it is going to make it look more official. The NYC pass is not checked against any databases; it\\'s just a photo of your paper document.\\nI don\\'t think calling 311 will help, as they won\\'t know any more than the people checking proof at the door.\\nThis is the same issue that Americans in Italy have recently had with CDC cards, and it just takes a while for it to get sorted out.\\nEdited: 12:56 pm, September 09, 2021 I’ve been in Italy since the beginning of August when they first started requiring the Green Pass, and I’ve been able to get into every place I wanted to with my CDC card, so I imagine you will be ok with your Green Pass in the US. Have a paper copy of your info because the US isn’t as tech-savvy as Europe is.\\nAs #4 says, be prepared for some confusion if you’re the first Italian they’ve had to deal with. The people checking here always have to show it to someone else before they approve it—it’s happened to me and other Americans here, but it’s always been ok. >>>nor will they understand something written in Italian<<<\\nThe EU Green Pass proof of vaccination for an Italian it’s not going to be in Italian language only.\\nIt will definitely be IN English as well. Many things are written in several languages in Europe, This will be no exception.\\nEdited: 2:41 pm, September 09, 2021 Does using the Green Pass require access to a device that can scan it and access the EU database,or is there some other way to read the English version with the same information? The green pass is digital and printable form. It’s in English and Italian, German and French as well.\\nhttps://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioNotizieNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=english&menu=notizie&p=dalministero&id=5531\\nhttps://www.dgc.gov.it/web/ —-this site is where i saw it stated that it was an English, Italian plus German and French as well.\\n“In italiano e in inglese, più francese o tedesco”\\nI just thought it highly unlikely that this pass would be not be printed in more than one language.\\nEdited: 4:32 pm, September 09, 2021 We are flying to the US to tour colleges—1st week split between Boston & NYC, weekend at Virginia Beach, second (short) week in DC/B’more area.\\nWe will rent a car if forced, but prefer not to. We are also not into long bus rides, so I guess boats & trains are what we are looking at. What are the best options for the different segments of our trip?\\nBoston-NYC\\nNYC-Va beach\\nVa beach-DC\\nThere are numerous ferries from New England to different parts of NYC. How do they compare to Amtrak?\\nAmtrak from NYC to VA Beach is twice as long as driving. We don’t have that much time. Are there any options besides renting a car?\\nWe could get to DC by boat or train from NYC & then rent a car for the round trip to VaBeach. Does that make sense?\\nWhat other advice do you residents of megalopolis have for getting from one city to the next? Within each city, we will use public transit; is there a regional pass that works up & down the coast? What else do we need to know? It has been a long time since I posted on Trip Advisor! How do I cross-post on other fora, and which would be most useful for this question? (I chose NYC because it’s in the middle of our trip). Is there a forum for the general region, including the NE & Va coast?\\nEdited: 7:28 am, September 09, 2021 There is no ferry from Boston to NYC. To get to a ferry you would probably need to rent a car.\\nThe easiest way from Bos to NY is Amtrak. The regular train is comfortable. The Acela is fast but much more expensive.\\nWhen leaving Boston sit on the left side of the train for the best views.\\nIn Boston you can board at South Station or Back Bay. I prefer South Station. It\\'s a full service station with places to puck up food for the ride and wait if you get there a bit early. But if your hotel is near Back Bay station, it\\'s ok to board there. You need to go to each forum and start a new post. It\\'s ok to copy and paste the same thing in multiple places. “ We could get to DC by boat or train from NYC & then rent a car for the round trip to VaBeach. Does that make sense?”\\nThere is no boat from New York City to Washington, DC. You could fly from NYC to ORF. Or, if VA Beach is not a must, switch to a more convenient beach, like Rehoboth for example, which has a ferry to Cape May,NJ (with buses to NYC) and buses that go quickly to the DC area. Or yeah, just rent a car if you think the train takes too long. Amtrak between Boston & NYC\\nThen comparison price flights to ORF from all 3 NYC airports (LGA, JFK & EWR)\\nOnce there you\\'ll probably want to rent a car\\nReturn the car in DC (or Baltimore) - depending on which colleges you will be touring\\nThere is no regional transit pass Trains, planes, and automobiles (or buses) are your only options. An intercity boat from Boston to NY or from NY to DC would take at least twice as long as land based travel would, if it existed.\\nI mean, I guess you could ferry from Boston to Provincetown, get to Hyannis somehow and ferry to Martha\\'s Vineyard, and from there ferry to New York on Seastreak, but that would be very time consuming and expensive You might also try posting in the Road Trips forum. They are specialists in multi city travel. Amtrak is great for BOS<->NYC (not longer than driving time, and no traffic), and for NYC to DC as well. But from NYC to VA Beach, if not driving, the best bet would be to fly. Kay’s advice is best here, though you could also fly to DC from Norfolk VA if you are really averse to driving.\\nEach city has it’s own independent transit system.\\nAll the New England ferries I can think of don’t go to NYC but to Long Island specifically so people can avoid driving through nyc, so they’re really not an efficient system of transit along the coast; more for short, local distances/island connections. Do you already have your transportation all figured out for when you arrive in these locations? Depending on where you\\'re going in the DC/Baltimore area and Virginia Beach area especially, your public transit options may be limited. So that may tilt you one way or another whether or not a car rental makes sense for those areas.\\nEdited: 2:32 pm, September 09, 2021 Thoughts on this hotel? Reviews appear to be good. It will be just my daughter and I for 2 nights, October 23-25. We’ll be there as part of a multi-city college tour trip. We’ll arrive sometime Saturday evening from Boston, parking at Port Imperial and taking the ferry/free bus. Undecided on our activities Saturday night and Sunday- Brooklyn Bridge I know because we didn’t get to that last trip. Possibly a Broadway show, probably some time in Central Park. Still up in the air. Monday we are touring NYU at 10 am and Fordham at 2 pm. I found this hotel looking at places fairly close to Grand Central. We will subway to NYU and take Metro North to Fordham. I’m thinking we could leave our bags at the desk on Sunday, take Metro North back to Grand Central, walk to pick them up and then hop the free ferry bus. We head to Philly Monday evening.\\nWe visited in 2019 and stayed at the Hampton Inn Times Square North. We were very happy there, loved the location. That was closer to Central Park but I thought it would be more convenient to be closer to Grand Central this time, especially for Monday. The HGI is a little cheaper too.\\nThanks in advance for your thoughts. I’ll probably be posting again once we decide on some of our “tourist” activities. For location it is fine. About a 7-10 minute walk to grand central. Location is great for your purposes but rooms there are small and reviews say the place needs updating. You might check Hampton a inn TS Central too..same general location. On Sunday you are taking Metro North back from where? I thought appt at Fordham was Monday. Also mention taking free bus to Port Imperial Ferry. Are you sure that runs Sunday?\\nEdited: 12:08 pm, September 09, 2021 Sorry that was a typo! I keep getting in my head that since we’re there 2 nights over a weekend that it’s Friday-Sunday, but it’s really Saturday to Monday. Both tours are on Monday. I did check the ferry and free buses. We won’t need one Sunday but they do run on Saturday. The bus routes are fewer and longer but they meet every boat and the one we will take runs right down 42nd st which was another reason I was l was looking at the HGI. On Monday there will be buses more often and one route does just 42nd st.\\nThanks for the help, I will check out the Hampton as well! Thank you for sharing this link.

We will have just spent a week in the Adirondacks hiking, and would love to get a little taste of NYC. What would you suggest we do in such a short time frame?\\nAlso- I know the new mandates require proof of vaccination to enter most indoor places. I am not vaccinated, so that will really narrow down what we can do. Thank you for your suggestions! I don’t think you have 3 hours in Manhattan if your total layover is 5 hours. I think you’d have 2 hours at most.\\nWhat time of the day/day of the week is this? In all likelihood, you would end up at Penn Station at 7th Ave. around 32nd St. Since you like to walk, I would go up to Times Square at 7th Ave. and 42nd St. and then over to 5th Ave. in the 50s. You could walk back down 5th to see the Empire State at 34th St. and then return to Penn Station. Of course, this is best done on a nice weather day. We land at 4:00pm on a Friday and will leave at 9:15pm same day I would not risk leaving the airport. Yeah, I would not risk leaving the airport. Agree about not leaving the airport. Not going to have nearly as much time as you think. If we felt like rolling the dice and taking a gamble with leaving the airport, what would y’all suggest doing? If you were rolling the dice, I\\'d suggest trying some of the things that Fox mentioned in post #2. Just a suggestion, since you\\'re going to be upstate for a week, maybe reduce that by one night and spend it in the city. If you were to risk it, I think that Fox\\'s plan (#2) makes a lot of sense.\\nYou can walk from Penn Station at 32nd Street to Times Square at 42nd Street. Then up to 59th Street to see Columbus Circle, Then over to 5th avenue on the edge of Central Park.\\nYou can then walk down on 5th avenue over to the Empire State Building on 34th (you will pass Bergdorf, many designer stores, St. Patrick Cathedral, Rockefeller Center and New York Public Library).\\nThe total time for this walk is almost an hour and a half if you do not stop anywhere. Hi All\\nI am looking for some recommendations for dinner on Christmas Day. We are travelling from the UK and are not looking for a \\'Christmas Dinner\" or very fancy as its myself and 2 teenagers, the view is more important than the food. Just a traditional American rest/grill that serves nice steaks\\nand burgers, but also somewhere that will be festive with a view!\\nThanks for the help.\\nAmantha I 1st thought of River Café but it might be too fancy. It might help if we had your budget/entree.\\nEdited: 1:47 pm, September 08, 2021 Most places with views will be fancy and expensive.. Ceconi is an Italian with a view. Not sure they’ll be open for xmas but less expensive than many with views.\\nhttps://www.cecconisdumbo.com/system/files/052019/5cdb34cfebeeb57780000000/original/All_Day_Menu.pdf?1628865241\\nThe Chart House in Weehawken, NJ is an idea. They,re accessible by ferry and have great views. They\\'re a seafood restaurant but have steak and chicken.\\nhttps://www.chart-house.com/location/chart-house-weehawken-nj/#menus/ Hi, Im and flexible on budget, I dont mind if its expensive but want somewhere that caters for all tastes. Check out Manhatta to see if they reopen closer to when you\\'re visiting. Seems like they\\'re still closed because of the aftermath of the pandemic. I haven\\'t been, since I\\'ve been all that interested in the menus they\\'ve had in the past (can\\'t remember if they\\'ve had burgers on the menu but I think they have had both meat and fish options). Stunning views though. Thank you I will 😊 I thought of Manhatta too. If they\\'re open and offering Christmas Dinner it would be perfect, depending on the price. A Thanksgiving meal there was a set price of $120.00 from memory, with 3 courses included. When you say \"view,\" do you mean something high up/rooftop? They tend to be more expensive.\\nWould water views be acceptable? The View at Battery Park https://masterpiececaterers.com/view-at-the-battery/, Gigino\\'s Wagner Park, and Merchants River House https://www.merchantsriverhouse.com/ all have water views, the first two have good views of the Statue of Liberty. None of them are expensive.\\nIndustry Kitchen, The Fulton, Malibu Farm, Carne Mare are all at or near Pier 17 and have views of the East River, and the Brooklyn Bridge, and uptown views, to different degrees. Industry Kitchen is pretty inexpensive.\\nAlso check to see if City Vineyard is open on Thanksgiving. Great Hudson River views.\\nEdited: 11:54 pm, September 08, 2021 Our flight on Friday now will not arrive until after 10PM- Heading to The Lexington hotel.\\nWill a cab be our best bet from LGA?\\nAny ideas for late night drinks and snacks near The Lexington(511 Lex)?\\nShortens our trip a bit but we will adjust!!!! when I land in LGA and head straight to Manhattan I take a taxi. it\\'s about $40.

I was just checking to see how late the Odeon in Tribeca was open these days as I think the kitchen used to be open until something like 4AM, making it a good standby when other reservations were missed because of delayed flights, but even it is closing now at something like 11. The area you’re staying in is/was not a particularly good late night area. The pandemic has closed a few of the Irish bars in the area that once would have worked. Absolutely have a plan. One place that is still open late and has a longish menu, in the case you get in too late for everything else, is Blooms Tavern on E 58th St., just east of the corner of 58th and 3d. They are apparently open til 2AM. I have eaten there. Though the food wasn\\'t particularly memorable, it was food. bloomsnyc.com It runs between the Hudson River pier at West 39th S. and St. George on Staten Island, with a stop at Vesey St., Battery Park.

Just wondering has Fitzpatrick’s Hotel Manhattan an Irish bar like The Wheeltapper bar in its sister hotel at Grand Central?\\nDoes anyone have any recommendations or tips about Fitzpatrick’s as we are due to stay there over and including Christmas Day. Thank you for that😊 A week or so ago, Risa posted a \"day in the life\" thread that several frequent visitors who miss the city painfully mentioned enjoying. More recently, NYCForever posted on another thread about a magical-sounding stroll they took in their Uptown Manhattan neighborhood. So, I thought I\\'d give a short (well, I\\'ll try to keep it short) account of Saturday in Park Slope & environs - and invite others to jump in to describe what they saw and experienced this past spring weekend. (Extending it into the week is fine, too.)\\nSaturday started off bright but chilly. I was doing a volunteer gig in Prospect Park, cleaning up trash - one of several groups that turned out to help. There was plenty of litter to pick up (don\\'t get me started on some of the things I fished out of the lake), but overall, I\\'d say the park was pretty clean. And despite the chill, it was being heavily used: lots of walkers and runners and cyclists on the main loop road, small gatherings in the grassy areas, kids (and grown-ups) playing, lots of dogs, people enjoying nature. (There\\'s currently an ultra-rare bird in the park that\\'s drawing crowds.)\\nAfter scavenging lunch at home, my husband and I hopped on CitiBikes and headed for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Advance reservations are still required, but they were easy enough to get that more-or-less spur of the moment visits are still possible. We signed up in the morning for a 2pm slot, entering at Flatbush Av (each entrance has its own sign-up, so being flexible helps). To get there, we rode a partial loop of the park - it was even busier than it had been in the morning, probably saw half a dozen birthday parties - docked our bikes a couple of blocks away, and were in with no wait. The gardens were gorgeous - still lots of bare branches and empty beds, of course, but camelias are in glorious bloom, as are hellebores, witch hazel, daffodils (there\\'s an entire hillside covered with them), various smaller bulbs, and magnolias. The cherry esplanade had *one* early cherry tree in full bloom, which 90% of the people at the garden seemed to be gathered around and taking pictures of.\\nOur route back home took us down Eastern Parkway (lots of people and vendors), past the Central Library (the gold figures on the exterior were glowing in the sun), through Grand Army Plaza (the weekly farmers market was just packing up), alongside the park (demonstrators had gathered in one corner to demand rent and debt cancellation), then down one of the brownstone streets to Fifth Av (\"the other Fifth,\" as it\\'s called hereabouts), where Open Streets was in full swing.\\nWe headed out again in the evening for more Open Streets. This was a milestone for us, the first time we\\'ve eaten in a restaurant with friends in over a year - thank you, vaccines! We met up on Fifth, then strolled the blocks, taking in the scene (kids riding their bikes! a guy doing tricks with a soccer ball! music! so many people!) while deciding where to eat. (Unlike what I understand to be the case in Manhattan, the great majority of restaurants in our neighborhood do NOT take reservations for outdoor dining.) We settled on Le Succulent, a favorite I\\'ve mentioned here before but that was new to our friends. We sat outdoors, ordered wine and appetizers (spicy accras de morue, codfish fritters), then had an extraordinary, mostly French meal. One of the things I love about this place is that the cooking is personal and seasonal, so the menu is a little different every time we go. Like, how about seared scallops with cauliflower florets and pickled apricots in a mint consomme? Or poached hake with broccoli rabe, pine nuts and sauteed radishes (who knew radishes could be cooked, and that they\\'re delicious that way)? Or hanger steak with a peppery cumin and coriander sauce?\\nAfter dinner we headed back home in opposite directions, but the scene on the street was still going strong. Mmmmm! You’re making me hungry Linda! What a great report! Thanks so much. (And thank you for helping clean the park!) I am actually hoping to make another trip report from Da Bronx this weekend. I have mapped out all the old houses of Da Bronx and hoping to photograph them Thank you for the report Linda and for cleaning the beautiful Prospect Park.\\nI personally love accras the morue but you have been trying to find recipes for sautéed radishes. I am not a fan of radishes but am thinking that they might actually be good sautéed. #3\\nyou really need to check out some of the parks in the outer Boroughs, Prospect Park was made by Frederick Olmstead, the same creator of Cetnral Park. If you Like Central park you will like it.\\nIf you Like Gardens, The Bronx Botanical Gardens is one of the best in the world and the Brooklyn one is nice too This looks good to me JC....I have ramps and creamer potatoes left and coincidentally was about to saute them up the way this recipe describes for radishes: https://kalynskitchen.com/sauteed-radishes-recipe-with-vinegar/ What a breath of fresh air post Linda . Thank you. Your writing is very visual, I can picture it.\\nThe Brooklyn botanical garden and Prospect Park are both things I want to see. I love parks and nature.\\nYour visual post on Brooklyn has cemented the idea of a visit. There’s so much to see there.\\nPS thanks for the museum tips in East Harlem/ upper Eastside on the other thread.\\nEdited: 11:34 pm, April 06, 2021 Thanks, LaRue!

It will be a hit for the kids, etc.\\nYes, I remember the ferris wheel in the old Toys R Us. That explains all the scaffolding and work I saw yesterday. Yeah, it was on the news the other day. This is a good article showing exactly what it’s like now that it’s up and running. The interesting thing to me is the amount of people in Times Square and the number of them wearing masks. Plus the video of the surrounding area as the Ferris wheel moves around.\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/times-square-ferris-wheel/ Each ride costs $20, few people are going to take this , most locals dont go to times square and not going to pay $20 a person to ride this.

I am still not going. Wow $35 if you want to skip the line Everyone said the same thing when they put A large Ferris wheel in downtown Seattle ( my hometown) on Elliot Bay. This one’s 175 feet and it was installed in 2012 or 2013, it’s a permanent structure.\\nMany said That locals would not go on it , but they did and they still do. if a New Yorkers wanted to go on a Ferris wheel, they would go on the Wonder Wheel in Coney Island, that\\'s a much nicer place to be on a Ferris Wheel Hello!\\nI was planning on coming to New York in April. I am coming with 2 boys, age 12 & 14. With the teacher discount (government rate), the NY Marriott Marquis and the Conrad Midtown are both about the same price, with the Conrad being ever so slightly cheaper. I was wondering which one is the better option. I would prefer to earn Bonvoy points from the Marquis, but if the Conrad is a lot nicer I will stay there instead.\\nThank you! I recently stayed at the Marriott Marquis with my 17 and 14 year old kids and thought it was great. My 14 year old actually slept comfortably on the large couch, so we all had a “bed.” The rooms seemed recently updated and are quite large in my NYC experience. I have not stayed at the Conrad so can’t compare. My preference would be the Conrad because it\\'s slightly further away from the bright lights and noise of Times Square. But it\\'s only a 10 minute walk to get there. It\\'s not far from Central Park either, so it would be easy to also walk up there if you have plans to see the park. Latest reviews are excellent.\\nHowever, kids might like the vibrancy of the Marquis. You step out the door and you\\'re right in the thick of the hustle and bustle. Some kids like that but others might feel overwhelmed. Adults too.\\nI would also compare rooms, which one has a bigger room, better bed arrangement, and better amenities for your group for example.\\nEdited: 6:28 pm, September 06, 2021 Are you sure they’re the same price for 4 people? According to the Conrad website, you\\'d need a suite with 2 queen beds which seem to go for a lot! A king suite won\\'t sleep 4. But if your discount gets you a 2 queen suite, compare that to a room at the Marquis with 2 doubles and a sofabed. There are a number of blogs that show the Conrad suites including\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/reviews/conrad-new-york-midtown/ Yup, it\\'s the same price for the queen suite. It says the regular rate is 640/night, but I\\'m getting it for $258. Not sure why the government rate is so low, but I\\'m not gonna complain... You say the queen suite. Do you mean the 2 queen suite? If yes and if you can get 2 doubles and sofabed at the Marquis, that’,s a tough call. I agree with Aynat that the kids would probably prefer the Marquis. It’s got glass elevators, floor to ceiling windowsill Nd seems glamorous when you walk in. The Conrad is a more upscale hotel. Which do you prefer? I am referring to the 2 queen suite, sorry for not being more clear. According to the website, the Marquis does not feature a sofa bed in the 2 doubles room. I could be wrong about that, though. They do list 2 doubles and sofabed as part of the “family connectors.” Maybe you can\\'t get that on it,s own. If that,s the case, you\\'d either have to do 2 doubles which doesn’t sound comfortable to me or get a king and sofabed if the boys can share a sofabed. Otherwise, that makes the decision and take the Conrad. The sofa in our 2 doubles room at the Marquis was technically not a sofa “bed”—it did not fold out—but it was large enough for my tall 14-year old to comfortably sleep. If you’re on the fence about details like this for your hotel decision, I definitely recommend just calling them. I’m sure they’ll be helpful. My husband and I have been looking at traveling to NYC in May 2022, the first week, for our 31st anniversary. The main things we want to see are the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, and maybe Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. We might take in a Broadway show, we know there is so much more to see and do but this is a start.\\nWe were thinking of Wednesday - Sunday (May 4th - May 8th). For this first \"quick\" trip for the few things we want to do is this doable?\\nWhere would you recommend we stay, our budget plus taxes would be $300.00 - 350.00 per night.\\nThank you in advance for any and all suggestions. Your plans are doable.\\nYour list has you in midtown and downtown. Either of those locations would work, but you can also pick other areas as well. I\\'d start with Union Square, the Village, or Soho for starters. Going to the Statue and also going to Ellis Island which is included in the ticket can take 4+ hrs. If you just want to pass by, that can be done in 1-3 hrs. depending on the cruise you take. People report the 9/11 Museum can take 3 hrs. Same with the intrepid.\\nWhere to stay depends on your preferences. Some people like the bright lights of the Times Square area and it would make going to and from a show walkable. Others hate the area and would rather stay in a less frenetic location while others are more concerned about dining and would like to stay near good restaurants. Wherever you stay, you\\'ll have to use the subway since the things you mention are spread out. If you want specific suggestions for a hotel, give us some input on what you like. Btw, I would suggest add ing Central Park to your list. Also know that while the Empire State is iconic, many prefer Top of the Rock from which you get a good view of the ESB. I agree, Central Park was and is my favorite thing to see/do in New York City. Don’t miss seeing at least part of it. For your hotel location, most first timers like to stay in or close to Midtown which is where most of the famous sights are located (even more than what you have listed). Some of your listed sights would suit staying in Midtown and opting for the subway to get you downtown to the 9/11 Memorial and the SOL. You could also stay downtown and take the subway up to your Midtown sights.\\nOthers like to stay somewhere in between the two areas, somewhere around Union Square, Flatiron, the Villages. Less touristy areas.\\nFor a range of hotels to take a look at in different areas, look at The Times Square Edition, The Westhouse, The W Union Square. These are 5 star hotels coming in on budget on booking.com. Compare the rate to the hotel\\'s own website as well.\\n4 star properties I can see on booking.com also within budget are Gild Hall (way under budget at a fantastic price), The Artezen, Bryant Park Hotel. The World Center Hotel is close to both the Statue Cruises Ferry and the memorial. Also, a couple good restaurants that are a 10-15 min walk are Gigino’s Wagner Park, and Industry Kitchen.\\nIf you get your Empire State Building tickets online and go 10 mins before it opens you will save yourself from buying those expensive express passes. Also, after you can walk up 5th Ave (see some more of Manhattan) and enter Central Park on 5th Ave & 59th St (Central Park South) and go up the Mall to the Boat house and Have Lunch at the Central Park Boat House.\\nWhat ever you decide, happy planning, stay safe, be well, and have fun! Thank you everyone for taking the time to offer suggestions. I’m going to take each comment and research the suggestions. These are helpful in my planning. We have 4 adults (2 couples) traveling to NYC later this month (Sept) Looking for a Great Hotel that\\'s centrally located...looking to spend $250 or less/night. We don\\'t want to stay in Times Square area. Does anyone have a recommendation? Once we decide on a hotel and what area we\\'ll be staying in, we will plan our dinners out/activities etc... Thanks! Is that per couple / room or for both couples? Are you looking for one room each or to share (and if so, what bed configuration do you need - two queens can sometimes be a little bit more expensive than two doubles)?\\nI like vibrant areas with a great amount of restaurants and also near a subway stations, so that\\'s what I\\'m looking for when booking hotels. Some of my favorite areas are:\\nGreenwich Village\\nEast Village\\nUnion Square\\nTribeca\\nSoho\\nThe Financial District sometimes has some well-priced hotels and is a good base if your near one of the subway hubs in the area, since this make it easy to get to wherever you need to be.\\nEdited: 1:42 pm, September 05, 2021 I agree with Maxi. A vibrant area with a great number of restaurants and great subway connections is what I want too and in budget. I wouldn’t choose to stay in Time Square either.\\nDo you have your specific dates in September? With specific dates you can get specific hotel recommendations that fit that $250 budget. Additionally if that $250 budget room is for the 4 of you or just two of you each.\\nIs this your first time visiting?\\nI love all the areas post number one mentioned. I would add to the mix Flatiron district /Nomad And midtown east; specifically near Bryant Park or Grand Central Station.\\nPut some hotel choices in budget on a map And see how convenient the locations are in relation to what you want to see. Thanks for your reply! We are looking for 2 separate rooms, king sized bed in each. That price is per room. Prices fluctuate by date so hard to tell what will be within budget. While I agree with the areas listed there aren\\'t many hotels in Greenwich village. I think you have to find some hotels in budget that interest you and post back with the options you find. Taxes will add 15% to prices and some places tack on a resort fee on top of that. If you like modern hotels, take a look at the CitizenM Bowery. On booking.com it\\'s within your budget (possibly, without knowing exact dates). Great location for restaurants and nightlife. We are going to be there the weekend of Sept 24th. I am looking at Arlo Nomad and Cambria in Chelsea. They both seem like a good location. Chelsea, NoMad and Midtown seem to be good as far as location goes- The Arlo hotels are good (there are a few of them), but rooms are very small. Cambria Chelsea is good, it often gets mentioned on here.\\nThey\\'re both not far from each and and are in a great area. NoMad and heading down to the Flatiron district has lots of cafes and restaurants. You\\'re not far from the ESB either. I think I slightly prefer the Arlo location though and the more up to date decor.\\nThey both have an outdoor rooftop bar and lounge.\\nFor couples, decide if room space is a big deal, you might prefer the Cambria because of the extra space. Arrived Thursday afternoon, checked into The Edition at Madison Square Park. Met up with a friend dating back to nursery school, grabbed a cocktail and great photo op at 230 5th before dinner at Ilili, which was good. Had a nightcap at Old Town Bar before calling it an evening.\\nOn Friday walked all the way from my hotel to another friend’s apartment in Battery Park with an obligatory stop along the way at Washington Square Park.It was a hot day but I walked in the shade when I could. Grabbed lunch at Odeon in Tribeca (burger was nothing special) before heading on to a short ferry ride to Governors Island. Great views of Lower Manhattan and The Statue of Liberty. Had a couple of cocktails waiting out an afternoon downpour. Tired from a long day I had dinner at Eataly, which was OK.\\nSaturday morning had some danish at Ole & Steen, hit the nearby Equinox for a workout, brunch at Sarabeth’s and picked up a new Yankee tshirt….decided I was not going to try and pay $500 minimum to see Springsteen and, instead, snagged a last minute seat at the bar at Misi in Williamsburg. Great meal followed by a walk through Domino Park that gave me wonderful photo ops of the Manhattan skyline. I really liked the Kent Avenue area and will definitely be staying here (William Vale?) on my next visit.\\nToday I plan on going to Minetta Tavern—my gold standard for burgers (more like chopped steak) before visiting some cousins on the Upper West Side.\\n2020 was the first time in my life I had not spent any time in NY; hopefully the only time that happens. Love your trip report so far. I like you rpick of places to eat. Ilili is a place I\\'d gladly return to, for example. Lovely trip report thank you. It sounds like my kind of trip.\\nI had to cancel my trip that would’ve been happening right about now, But reading yours made me smile. I am enjoying reading your report. I do understand the feeling of 2020 being the only year I haven\\'t been to New York. I went last weekend so 2021 is already different.\\nHow long are you in New York City for? Sounds like we have similar tastes. Try Upland near your hotel. Bucatini is great and I\\'m not a big pasta lover. Good pizza too.\\nCheck out photography museum Fotografiska. The restaurant is gorgeous.\\nEdited: 1:34 pm, August 29, 2021 In Manhattan until tomorrow afternoon, 2 nights on Long Island before I return home Wednesday (hopefully, flight not effected by Ida).\\nJust checked out a live, free jazz band at Madison Square Park across the street from my hotel after a light snack at Rezdora (very good, might go back for dinner rather than Minetta).\\nForgot to name place where I had drinks on Governors island—Island Oyster….cool spot….off to the UWS in a bit to see my cousin for a quick visit.\\nThanks for that museum tip.\\nEdited: 2:59 pm, August 29, 2021 Bummer that you skipped Springsteen, as it was truly extraordinary, 2 hours and 20 minutes of pure joy. But everything else sounds great.\\nOf all of the restaurants of that ilk, Odeon is my least favorite. They dial it in now. It used to be fantastic. Now it’s just for the nostalgia. Check out some of the recent coverage of Keith McNally and his dispute w his brother. (Look in NYTimes. Somehow I can’t cut and paste).\\nAlso, Mark’s Off Madison is really good. Near your hotel.\\nEdited: 3:09 pm, August 29, 2021 The Edition, Ilili, Eataly, Domino Park, Governors Island, The William Vale, sounds like deja vu for me! All things I\\'ve enjoyed over the years.\\nIf you think you\\'ll like The William Vale you probably will. Summer is great there, the pool is huge and well cared for. Plus those views from the Westlight roooftop are sublime. You can see the whole of Manhattan from top to bottom.\\nThanks for reporting back.\\nEdited: 6:46 pm, August 29, 2021 Happy you are having a good time. Enjoy your trip. Thanks for your report. One other tidbit of information: I found the yellow cabs to be nearly 1/2 the cost of Uber and Lyft. Great trip report. Can\\'t wait to read more. Good to learn about the difference in costs between cabs and uber. I thought Uber would be cheaper. We will be travaling down from the Albany area and would like advice on where to book a room outside the city that is in a \"safe\" area with easy access to trains, etc. for a trip into Manhattan. We\\'ll be following the Hudson down 9W.\\nAlso, any input about the drive down 9W? We will be there in October so thought that might be the most scenic route. Anything \"not to miss\" on our way down? Thanks! So you are driving down in your personal vehicle?\\nIs this for a day trip only or several days?\\nHave you considered parking at a Metro North commuter train station (perhaps Poughkeepsie) and then taking the train in to a hotel in the city? Yes we are driving down and will only be there for an overnight stay and a quick trip to Manhattan to see relatives. Tarrytown Hilton, I think there is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the Tarrytown Metro-North Station, otherwise just take a taxi or Uber **Tarrytown Hilton, I think there is a shuttle bus from the hotel to the Tarrytown Metro-North Station**\\nThat\\'s not a Hilton anymore. It\\'s a Sleep Hollow or something like that, No shuttle services. Seems its a Doubletree inn , not a Hilton anymore, Doubletree is part of Hilton\\nIf there is no Shuttle, they can taxi or Uber between Hotel and train\\nTarrytown is a nice area by itself anyway\\nEdited: 1:19 pm, August 31, 2021 If we wanted to be closer to the statue of Liberty would Jersey City/Hoboken be an OK area? Any info on ease of movement from there? Any reason for not wanting to stay in Manhattan? #8 - You\\'d want a hotel within walking distance of the PATH train https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/schedules-maps.html Similar to, but separate from, the NYC subway system\\nWhich direction are you heading afterwards? West/south or elsewhere? Is the MTN-Hudson Line likely to be back in service by October 7th? Or is it impossible to guess? If not, where would be a good place to pick up a car so as to avoid driving through Manhattan but within reach of public transportation from the midtown area? Thank you. October 7? They are looking to get parts of it running by tomorrow. Sounds like you won\\'t have a problem, but if I were ever in a position like that I would probably look to rent someplace like White Plains, on the Harlem line. train should be fine I did some searching and only find old info.

Also check out 12 Chairs. Very traditional Israeli food, jachnoon, malawach, shakshuka. There\\'s also a Palestinian restaurant called Qanoon on 21st and 9th that I keep meaning to check out. It\\'s funny we spent a week in Morocco and had no memorable food. It happens. If \"memorable\" is what you\\'re looking for, more than straight middle eastern, go to Nur. Chef Meir Adony uses the flavor profiles of the Middle East in a modern, memorable way. It\\'s one of my favorites. So much more than a falafel or tangine place.\\nhttps://nurnyc.com/ Thanks Risa that is the response I was looking for. Happy to help. Make sure you have the Panipuri. One of the most creative and delicious dishes in Manhattan. If you’re willing to head to Brooklyn, there’s a large Arab community in Bay Ridge. That’s where I normally go…you’ll find tons of small, family-run places there, mainly Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian and (to a lesser extent) Yemeni. Stand-outs in my mind include Tanoreen for modern Palestinian; Ayat, also Palestinian, with a mix of street food & home cooking; and for fish (especially grilled - mashwi - preparations), Bahary. Just wondering if teenagers of 18 and 19 with a parent can go into restaurants that are very bar-like, or piano bars that serve food? Or is it up to the establishment? We are coming from somewhere that traditionally didn\\'t have a drinking age (I think they may have made it 18 recently, but I\\'m not even sure!), and when we have traveled in the US with the kids in the past we have been to restaurants that were clearly not bar-like. So, this isn\\'t something I\\'ve really had to think about before. There are some piano bars and wine bars I like the look of that are also restaurants, and just wondering if they are an option at all with teenagers. I do know that if the kids are allowed in they won\\'t be served. I actually did some searching on this and it seems that the answer is yes according to state law. It also seems that the kids could go to a few venues that aren\\'t even restaurants, they more like clubs - they just can\\'t drink alcohol. Is that the case? Restaurants that serve real food (as opposed to bar snacks) will gladly allow teenagers, You won\\'t be seated at the bar but other than that, there\\'s no issues. The teens can\\'t be served alcohol lest the establishment loose their license to serve liquor.\\nEdited: 2:54 pm, September 06, 2021 Bajanswife, it’s totally dependent on the establishment. There’s no legal distinction between bars/clubs/restaurants. Best to check ahead (and/or have a “plan B”). Not only do different venues have different policies, but some of them change their policies depending on the time of day. Where earlier in the day under age people can be admitted but as the evening goes on they limit it to 21+. Really need to check in advance or have backup plans if turned away at the door. In general the more of a lounge feel a place has the less likely they are to admit people under 21 vs the places that are more restaurant oriented. There are certainly places in NYC that at least part of the time will meet your criteria. I dunno what is open and what is not right now though. OK sounds like if I want to try such a place I will either ask when making reservations (if it\\'s that sort of place) or will have a plan B or C nearby. That\\'s the best plan, just ask. If you see a line at the door, move on to the next place - they\\'re checking IDs. Honestly. I don\\'t think you\\'ll have any problem as long as you stay away from places that are not obviously exclusively bars. As for avoiding places that have long lines, that can apply to restaurants that are not bars that are very popular. My standard answer to dining is always that if there is a place you really want to dine in, it is always a good idea to make a reservation. When you do that, you can always ask if there are any age restrictions. If you do find a place by just walking by, you\\'ll be stopped at the door if underage folks are not allowed. If you are stopped, just ask the person who stops you if they have any recommendations as there are something like 26000 restaurants in NYC & my sense is that the vast majority will not have an issue seating your party. All IMNSHO of course.\\nLastly, since you were aware enough to ask the question, I am certain that you won\\'t take a family group into a place that doesn\\'t look family friendly.\\nEdited: 8:36 pm, September 06, 2021 We\\'re going to be in New York for a week in December 12 to 19 and looking for a good place to stay.

I would suggest that you look into staying outside of the city for a cheaper hotel. Look in Jersey City off the Path train. It\\'s a quick ride into the city and it\\'ll be easier to park a car than it would be in Manhattan (assuming you want one). The views are great and the prices will be better. Re #7. I thought the Blakely closed some time ago, possibly before the pandemic. Have they reopened? Has anyone used this site before? Is it legit? I\\'ve found better deals on there but I don\\'t want to book through them without any feedback. Did you have problems checking in to a hotel when you went? Very reliable. But as with any site you might want to contact the hotel directly to see if they\\'ll do better than the price quoted on the third-party site. I never had a problem but after the reservation is \"confirmed\" through any on line site I wait about 2 hours then call the hotel directly. I\\'ve booked rooms through hotels.com at least a dozen times with no problems. Agree with above about checking directly with hotel in case you can get a better rate and always pay attention to the cancellation policy. It has a good reputation. Just read all of the fine print to understand the cancellation policy for whatever you are booking, and whether the hotel has extra fees they charge. I think hotels.com has gotten pretty good about showing those extra fees - I was just looking at rooms in Vegas and right under the price it says \"excludes daily resort fee\". But definitely always check so there are no surprises! Hotels.com is the same company as Expedia, which also owns Hotwire. Expedia and Priceline (which owns Booking.com) are the two big players in the online travel marketplace. Reliable, yes - but I would always try to book directly and, if you see a better price on the site see if the property will match it. From what I understand, Hotels.com is on par with the other well-known third-party booking portals. The big question, however, is why use a third-party booking portal in the first place if you can book directly with the hotel for the same or a lower price? I have yet to book directly with a hotel that wasn\\'t willing to match the quote from a third-party, and many hotels have a low price guarantee if you book direct through the hotel\\'s website. Indeed, with rare exceptions, I have found that the price quote on the hotel\\'s website is the same or lower than the price from the third-party vendor after verifying that the room and all applicable fees are identical.\\nI have also found that third-party booking sites are fine when everything goes right with the reservation, but not so fine when things go wrong, such as a room that does not match the description on the reservation, a room that looks into a dumpster or air shaft , or an unexpected charge on the invoice. In my experience, and from what I have learned from people in the hospitality industry, hotels are much more likely to move the guest to a different room, offer an upgrade, offer perks, or waive fees to resolve problems if the guest booked directly with the hotel (particularly if the guest participates in the hotel\\'s rewards program), than it is if the guest booked through a third-party. Well of course, since the hotel is making more money off that guest since they don;t have to give a cut to the booking service. The question is if the hotel will match the same deal.\\nAnd key is reading the small print and understand when you have to cancel to avoid paying a penalty. I always use booking.com and hotels.com and also check hotel site as well. I continue to monitor all and watch for special discount emails. And have frequently reduced my initial rate. I\\'ve re--booked the same hotel for the same dates 3 times now for our upcoming trip. First on the hotel\\'s site (AAA rate), again when that rate dropped slightly, and now I just re-booked on Booking.com because they had a VERY substantial sale, much lower than the hotel\\'s website.\\nThe only time I\\'ve asked for a price match with third party the answer was \"no\". That might not always be the case, but rates are computerized, etc. Plus there could be contractual things involved that prevent the hotel from matching if they push a special promotional sale with a third party site. That\\'s just speculation. It does not surprise me that hotels may not always be able to match the rate they give to a third-party site to promote the hotel.\\nI have mixed feelings about third-party sites. I have never been disappointed with them, but it sometimes feels \"right\" to book directly and I wonder if I will be able to get a better room. Who knows... I often book directly these days.\\nThe plus side of booking with a third-party site is that it is easier to find your booking details, especially if you booked a couple of options, and you are going through their security process to submit your cc info, etc instead of the hotel\\'s own website. Some of those websites are rinky-dink. Even for those that are more professional, do they really have the same security as the giant players like Expedia, Hotels.com, etc? I doubt it but I have no first-hand info to back that up. The city will get tough about enforcement of the restrictions on Monday, Sept. 13:\\nhttps://www.nycgo.com/coronavirus-information-and-resources-for-travelers The main takeaway is that if you aren\\'t vaccinated, you won\\'t be able to enter most indoor public spaces (including museums and restaurants, but apparently even the zoo), and probably shouldn\\'t bother visiting. (Children under 12 who can\\'t be vaxxed must wear a mask). ^^ For the zoos, you\\'ll need to show proof of vaccination to enter any indoor exhibits, but not for outdoor areas. (This is what emails from the Wildlife Conservation Society have been telling me) With vaccination, do you still need a mask for indoors?\\nHeading in a couple weeks for a show and do know that you have to inside the theater, but wondering about restaurants and such.\\nEdited: 4:37 pm, September 02, 2021 I\\'m glad they\\'re mentioning many of the vaccines countries around the world have been using to vaccinate their citizens, not just the US based ones.\\nTime will tell how effective any of them are, but at least they\\'re all included on the list. @3 there are indoor mask mandates for schools, transit, correctional and health settings etc that apply to even vaccinated people. In addition to that businesses can require everyone to wear masks. Frankly we know the virus variant is very contagious and even vaccinated people can get infected and/or pass it to others. It makes the most sense to wear masks indoors and in my experience most people do wear masks indoors even in places were it is not specifically required. As for restaurants once people are at their tables if they are eating indoors they usually take the mask off and keep it off while at their table. Good. The vaccination and masking restrictions are actually why we feel NYC is a safer vacation spot right now for vaccinated folk such as ourselves. I won’t eat indoors at restaurants here at home because vaccination is low, no one is wearing masks, and masks are few at stores and indoor venues, et al. We are planning a trip to NYC for this fall. BTW, my condolences for the troubles and lives lost due to the recent flooding. @6 if it is the earlier fall you can just eat outdoors which is safer and can be quite pleasant in the first part of the fall. #3 You also need to keep in mind that as circumstances change, requirements may change. Some arts organizations, in their fine print, are reserving the right to impose requirements in addition to vaccination -- like masks, designated timed entry to performances, etc. So look for updates from whoever sold you the tix. (Note too some ticket fine print also includes waivers in which you agree not to hold producer, theater owner, board of nonprofit, etc liable in event you become sick after attending performance.) @4 Agree. In Australia many have only had access to AZ , me included, and initially some concern USA may not recognise it as valid vax We (me and my 18 year old daughter and her 19 year old boyfriend) are thinking of coming to NYC in the second week of November when he has his college term break and can meet up with us (we\\'re coming from Barbados, he\\'s coming from Canada). We are all fully vaccinated and accustomed to strict protocols (masking, sanitizing and distancing). I am not sure how I feel yet about crowded indoor dining and Broadway performances, so at this point the trip is still tentative. I saw mention of outdoor heated patios being available in November last year, but I also saw comments that the way some of them were set up they weren\\'t much safer than indoors. I know vaccinated people can spread Covid-19 as well, though studies suggest it\\'s not to the same extent as unvaccinated people (on average), so having rooms filled with only vaccinated people doesn\\'t make me feel completely safe. I\\'m not that worried about the plane, because of the filtration system, but the airports can be a bit scary. I guess I\\'m going to have to make up my mind what my personal comfort level is. The kids are not worried, but I\\'m in a higher risk category than they are due to age and being overweight (no other known conditions). I am keeping an eye on things in NYC until it\\'s time to decide for sure. I can definitely say that NYC is one of the only places in the USA I would consider traveling to in November because of their strict protocols and vaccine mandates. I would also consider a warmer place like Florida, only because I could easily eat all meals outdoors. My biggest concerns are restaurants (because masks get removed while eating) and Broadway shows (and I can\\'t imagine going to NYC without seeing any shows because I\\'m not sure when I\\'d get back there again - it seems like a waste of an opportunity!). This coming Saturday and Sunday, September 4 and 5, is a Bank of America Museums on Us weekend. You can get into participating museums without charge by showing your B of A card and photo ID. Participating museums in NYC include the Met and the Whitney. More info on the Museums on Us website. Funny you should mention these. We are at the Whitney tomorrow and at the Met on Sunday thanks to this program. Did the Intrepid last time we were in town. They\\'ve been doing this for years, nothing new. They change museums from time to time, adding and removing. The Intrepid for example was added a few years before the pandemic started.\\nHere is the information, it\\'s also not just this weekend, it\\'s every first full weekend of the month:\\nhttps://about.bankofamerica.com/en-us/what-guides-us/arts-and-culture/partners.html#fbid=9V6LkYStfe7 Note that the B of A rules say it is first full Saturday and Sunday of month. Didn\\'t say anything about Monday of holiday weekend. Actually, I double checked that on their site and didn\\'t see anything about it, so no guarantee any museum would extend that to the Mon (to the extent they are actually open Mon; some aren\\'t).\\nI didn\\'t mention this because I thought it was a wonderful new thing, I\\'m not a fool; I\\'ve been a B of A cardholder for decades, have known about it from beginning, and think I have mentioned upcoming weekends here before. I just thought that with more people traveling right now, esp people from outside NY who have to pay to get into Met, it was worth mentioning as reminder. Whitney allowed us in 15 minutes early. Very well masked in line and inside.\\nMet we had 10AM reservations, which is when they opened the doors. We were approx 150th in line and were inside in 10 minutes or so. They asked to see our BoA cards, the Whitney did not and I don’t think the Intrepid asked back in July. Have any recent (including 1st time) visitors used a guidebook you felt worked well for you? Also, I am finding that entrance fees to many attractions are budget busters so we will have to prioritize these . . . what are some of the free and inexpensive activities that both locals and visitors enjoy? Transportation is also an expense to consider; we are staying in midtown Manhattan. TIA Do you like to walk and explore neighborhoods?

If you want to consider it supply more info to get further advice\\nEdited: 10:06 am, September 04, 2021 Good afternoon,\\nMy husband and I are visiting New York (from UK) at the beginning of December. It will be my first visit. Can I ask for recommendations for a romantic, Christmassy hotel in central New York. Thinking roaring fire - luxury rooms etc. No budget in mind so fire away.\\nMany thanks\\nNikki I would pick The Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca - love that location, love the look of the hotel. It\\'s been waaay over my budget, but it ticks all of my boxes when it comes to high-end luxury cozy boxes. Great area for restaurants and public transport as well.\\nThere are some in Midtown and perhaps Upper East Side that would fit your bill too, but since I don\\'t keep tabs on those as much since they aren\\'t in areas where I personally prefer to stay I won\\'t name names. I\\'ve seen some wonderful pictures of Christmas-decorated places there but can\\'t remember which hotels they were. The Lowell hotel has suites with their own fireplaces. Here\\'s a great article on hotels with fireplaces in rooms and also in the lobby\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/guide/new-york-city-hotel-fireplaces/\\nThe Greenwich that Maxi mentions is in that list and lovely, but it’s not centrally located in what would be considered the typical first visit location. The Peninsula and the St. Regis sound like what you want, but crazy expensive.\\nThe Lotte Palace hotel was always considered the quintessential Christmas hotel right near Rockefeller Center and beautifully decked out, but I don\\'t think it,s what you have in mind.\\nhttps://www.lottenypalace.com/the-palace Thank you so much for your quick reply. I will check out your recommendation. Nikki Thank you so much. I can’t wait to google your recommendations. Funnily enough, I was looking at the Peninsular just half an hour ago. Nikki @nywhiz -- thanks for sharing that article. I cannot afford those types of hotels, but they are nice to look at. Make sure anything you book is cancellable as UK citizens still not allowed entry to US\\nI have flights with Virgin booked for Dec 3 rd ,staying once again at the Crosby Street Hotel in Soho but still looking as though trip will be aborted I had Astro Zennica vaccination which US are not recognising at the moment\\nI live in hope! Ladywndermere, why do you think AstraZeneca is not recognised in the USA? Have you been told that by your airline or somebody else?\\nAstraZeneca IS a recognised vaccine in the USA now. It\\'s one of the World Health Organisations recognised vaccines for emergency use (most of them are), and the USA\\'s Center for Disease Control also recognises it now.\\nHowever, the UK is still on the banned list of countries entering the USA. I don\\'t think it\\'s because of AstraZeneca. Many countries have administered AstraZeneca and they\\'re not banned.\\nFor anybody arriving in NYC from overseas you will need to provide proof in NYC you have been fully vaccinated (with any vaccine) when you arrive and when dining out etc.\\nTake a read of these websites and look for where it mentions vaccines, including AstraZeneca:\\nhttps://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory\\nhttps://www.nycgo.com/coronavirus-information-and-resources-for-travelers\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 9:04 pm, September 03, 2021\\nEdited: 9:04 pm, September 03, 2021 Hi it was still stating ( Sunday Times last weekend) that US had not recognised Astro Zennica as a valid vaccine so this was an additional criteria for me to be able to fly to US.\\nI will certainly check it out although not relevant till they open the flight path!!!\\nAll can come to UK so to me should be reciprocated!\\nStated also may be some review on September 16th?\\nThanks for the info We go 3rd December too and with Virgin!This is rebooked from December last year!

For June 2022\\nWe want fancy, low lit, soft piano music / soft jazz music.\\nSteak/ seafood/ Italian / French\\nA city view would be beautiful but not a prerequisite\\nAny ideas for a really nice evening ? Maybe the River Cafe, which is in Brooklyn, but has a great view of the NYC skyline, in addition to a pianist playing the American jazz standards like \"Satin Doll.\" Funny, I can’t think of the last time I was in a restaurant w “soft piano music/soft jazz music”. But maybe I don’t go to really romantic restaurants?\\nTry looking at Carne Mare, Electric Lemon (haven’t been there yet, looks promising) https://electriclemonnyc.com/#about and\\nSaga, on the roof of 70 Pine, same ream as Crown Shy (which I love, but haven’t been to the rooftop restaurant yet) https://www.google.com/amp/s/ny.eater.com/platform/amp/2021/8/17/22627494/saga-restaurant-opening-crown-shy-nyc I agree\\nRivercafe.com\\nsounds like what you want.

On December 25, museums and major retailers will be closed (government agencies of course, but it\\'s Saturday anyway). Many restaurants will be closed, but a large percentage will be open. Some Broadway shows will not perform. Transit will run on a Sunday schedule.\\nDecember 26 will be a regular Sunday. Many things that are normally open will be closed for Christmas day (but it\\'s a business decision not a legal restriction)\\nThe day after Christmas is always a major sale shopping day. Xmas is virtually dead in all cities and states in the U.S as is Thanksgiving. A few things are open such as movie theatres however. jordansbull, have you spent Christmas Day in NYC? Because it is far from dead. Are there bars with Live music during the week in lower east side or near there? Club Cumming often, you need to check the schedule Café Wha - https://cafewha.com/ Where are there some really good delis in NYC. Not the tourist ones like Katz, 2nd Ave. I’m looking for some outstanding pastrami sandwiches. Thx I would be heading over to Hometown BBQ in Industry City, Brooklyn but that might be too far for you.\\nCheck out this Eater list with included map: https://ny.eater.com/2021/2/17/22266913/where-to-find-nyc-best-pastrami Honestly, the best delis with outstanding pastrami *are* the tourist ones: Katz, Second Avenue, Sarge’s, the Pastrami Queen. It’s just not a big thing for most locals. I like Jewish deli food *a lot,* but I probably get it here once a year (if that), if I happen to find myself in the vicinity of one of the old warhorse delis at lunchtime and/or am with out-of-towners. (I eat more deli when I’m visiting family in Detroit than I do here.)\\nNot a deli, but with outrageously good (and outrageously expensive) pastrami: Hometown Barbecue in Industry City (Brooklyn). For good (not the best, but very good), reasonably-priced pastrami with a great back story: David’s Brisket House on Nostrand Av in Bed-Stuy, owned by o servant Muslims & serving a mainly Black clientele. Either of those spots would be well off the tourist track.\\nEdited to add - cross-posted with Aynat.\\nEdited: 6:13 pm, September 01, 2021 Yeah, Davids Brisket House too. Around the corner from me is Mile End. I am actually not sure if they have pastrami, but they have some good options. There arent very many jewish delis anymore\\nThere is Gottliebs and Essex on Coney in Brooklyn. Neither really is in a tourist area (Gotliebs is in Williamsburg) , there is also a Jewish Deli in the Time Out food Hall iby Brooklyn Bridge Park\\nThere is also one in the Bronx, I think near Woodlawn and another in Mill Basin Brooklyn (neither is easy access) If you want pastrami, try Eisenberg and Russ and Daughters. Neither on the list, but both iconic NYC venues. The one in the Bronx is called Liebermans, it was on Ayanats List\\nThis is the Mill Basin Deli\\nhttps://millbasindeli.com/\\nGotliebs in Brooklyn\\nhttps://gottliebsrestaurant.com/\\nEssex on Coney\\nhttp://www.essennydeli.com/\\nLibermans Deli in The Bronx\\nhttps://liebmansdeli.com/\\nBelive it or not there is only one Deli in Queens, Ben\\'s Delicatessen, and its more of a small chain rather than a real Deli\\nhttps://bensdeli.net/ #4: I like Mile End a lot, but it’s Montreal-style “smoked meat,” not pastrami.\\n(I’ll confess that it’s hard for me to tell the difference & I might even like smoked meat better (gasp). Also, they use superior rye bread.) No pastrami at Russ and Daughters but great smoked fish. http://russanddaughters.com/highholidays/ Eisenberg’s is temporarily closed by all accounts last I saw, remotely .\\nA Deli I really like is Sunny and Annie’s in Alphabet City. They have a huge eclectic menu . They do have pastrami .\\nI like to get the sandwiches that have all ingredients listed rather than build your own , in and building your own you end up paying more and getting less.\\nThe sandwiches are really good though. Looks like they’re still open 24 hours. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post was determined to be inappropriate by the Tripadvisor community and has been removed.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nOur staff may also remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.

I’m wondering how things are going there? I hope everyone is okay! Already a couple threads with lots of info on this, right on the first forum page https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13660925-Is_Manhattan_affected_by_Ida-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nTo summarize, if you are visiting the major tourist areas, you will be fine. I think you will be and probably not even notice anything, the parts that were hit the worse were not parts where tourists go nothing wrong with the areas, jut not of interest to tourists. Homes were hit the worst Have a great trip! Looking forward to your trip report. Going to make probably my last visit to NY soon. Always loved the veal at Carmines until the last visit a few years ago. If you wanted to stay in Midtown, take a look at Osteria Delbianco.\\nhttps://osteriadelbianco.com/\\nOr if you\\'d like a Viener Schitzel (veal) take a look at Wallse. Their sister restaurant Cafe Sabarsky in the Neue Galerie museum also has veal schnitzels.\\nhttps://www.wallse.com/ Thanks. We will be in all 5 boroughs. My favorite is veal Picatta. Look up Pietro’s in Midtown east Manhattan. Il Cortile on Mulberry St. has always had excellent veal, but I haven\\'t been there lately. Funny how all replies so far are from members somewhere outside NYC.\\nI could be asking about mole in Santa Fe or BBQ in Charleston. Not sure about Australia. Thanks all! https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/nyregion/pietros-in-manhattan-steak-row.amp.html\\nIn case you have never heard of Pietro\\'s. Funny.\\nVeal piccata is a classic dish that can be found in any classic style Italian restaurant. Look at Il Mulino, for example. Or the veal scallopini at Osteria del Bianco.\\nI don’t eat meat and most definitely wouldn’t eat veal. It kinda hurts to recommend places but you asked…. So while I can vouch for those restaurants as great places, I can’t specifically tell you whether that particular dish is any good. I was at osteria del bianco about 3 weeks ago. Haven’t been to Il mulino since before the pandemic. @7 I eat meat but I avoid veal. I want to go to Keens and try the Mutton chop. I have had lamb chops but not mutton at least not that I recall. FYI, I had pasta at OdB - taglioloni. It lacked seasoning and was a bit bland. But the room is pretty, the service is excellent, and it is across the street from Saks, and I was meeting a friend who works there. It is not expensive.\\nIf you want the total experience and price is no object, in truth, I would go Il Mulino in a heartbeat. ($40 vs $27). Thanks all. I have been so fortunate to travel much of this world, much with my daughter. No place can get me as excited at the great NYC! This may be the last daddy daughter trip and I can\\'t wait. I’ve not been to NYC in over 10 years.\\nI’m heading there next month with two friends who’ve never been. How is the vibe? General atmosphere?\\nStill a fabulous place to visit or is their a dramatic change due to covid, politics etc?\\nJust looking for recent opinion. Thanks ! A fabulous place to visit. An exciting and challenging place to live. I\\'m not sure exactly what you mean by \"politics\" but there hasn\\'t been a hugely dramatic change due to covid. People mostly wear masks in public indoor places, but not outdoors, and things are pretty much back to normal in terms of places being open, events going on, etc. Depending on when you come, you\\'ll have to show proof of vaccination for some things you do, but no big deal. The city vibe right now is pretty lively and normal. Wouldn\\'t call the city vibe normal compared to pre-pandemic. Don\\'t know why you are bringing up politics. That really has very little to do with the vibe of NYC. Obviously NYC like pretty much everywhere else has been impacted by covid. You aren\\'t going to be walking shoulder to shoulder with people during midtown lunch hours due to many people not being back in person at work. Vaccines are required for many indoor venues etc. You aren\\'t going to go into a bar or club and just walk up to strangers and start chatting, because some people are going to take issue with that due to covid. People are going about their lives and things are open, but it will be different from your prior trips. Best way to describe it would be that it a bit more subdued experience compared to your past trip with less crowding. May make the experience more enjoyable actually. Thank you!\\nGuess I shouldn’t of used the word “politics” but what I meant is there’s so much division and strife and anger between people.\\nSomeone told me over the city is so not the same, you won’t believe it ,so that kind of worried me as I have two friends that are so anxious to see all there is ! \"Someone told me over the city is so not the same,\" The city is not that drastically different. I think there is a case to be made that earlier in the pandemic that the city was very different in terms of experience, but things have returned more to a sense of normalcy at this point. It isn\\'t fully back to what it was but the difference isn\\'t extreme enough to take away from the experience. A lot of this depends on what part of the NYC experience you value most. If the main draw is the huge crowds and hustle and bustle well yea you may be disappointed. If the main draw is pretty much everything else that is all still here.\\nEdited: 8:41 pm, August 13, 2021 If the person who told you \"the city isn\\'t the same you won\\'t believe it\" was visiting NYC in May 2020, I\\'d agree with the assessment, but I can\\'t imagine you\\'d find it all that shocking of a difference in August 2021. Things are pretty lively, lots going on, lots to do, lots to see. No, it\\'s not exactly the way it was pre-pandemic, but much of the world isn\\'t the same right now, and there\\'s still a lot going on. Like red259 said, I actually think it\\'s a lot nicer right now with fewer crowds and a slightly slower pace. As for \"division and strife and anger between people,\" in my experience there\\'s no more of that in NYC than anywhere else in the country. The vibe now is more in Brooklyn and Queens. Because there are fewer tourists and fewer day workers the Manhattan scene is not what it was, Brooklyn and Queens are not as affected by tourists and day workers so those places are as lively as they were before The residential neighborhoods of Manhattan are just as lively as ever actually more so now than before. Manhattan isn\\'t solely areas like midtown.\\nEdited: 12:04 am, August 14, 2021 red, shhhhh, don\\'t tell anyone! It\\'s hard enough to get a reservation already. Well, I just got back from enjoying Summer Streets & the vibe was joyful & fun. I’d say Park Av in the 20s and 30s was a bit quieter than pre-pandemic, but pleasantly so, not in a desolate way. Ditto for Lex (I detoured over to Kalustyans to pick up a few items). Had a fabulous lunch at a modern Chinese place, Milu, recommended by another forumite.\\nBiked down to Canal St to get the train back to Brooklyn - again, not the crazy crowds of the “before” times, but pretty busy. Tourists are definitely coming back.\\nHit Brooklyn’s Fifth Av just in time for the start of our Saturday “open street,” and as always, the vibe was cheerfully relaxed. So nice to see neighbors strolling & kids playing in the middle of a car-free street. Thanks everyone for the help you have provided! I have booked flight and hotel, also planned out what to do for each day, I would like to hear your feedback. This will be my first time visiting New York, please help checking if the subway I am going to take is right.\\nDay 1 Tue 28 Sep\\nFly into LGA. Arrive around 11am.\\nTaxi to hotel Intercontinental - New York Time Square\\nLunch at An\\'nam.

That itinerary is impossible. Each day you have almost enough things to fill a day yet that is just your morning. You will be running the whole time. For your Met visit, just eat at the Met. You are leaving to go somewhere not that special.\\nBy the time you finish dinner in Chinatown, it\\'ll be dark. Not sure that\\'s the ideal time to do the bridge walk.\\n\"Uber/taxi to highline entrance near Whitney Museum of American Art, Walk the highline to Vessel,\\nLunch at Dim Sum Chelsea\\nWalk along 5 ave to see Flatiron Building, 1Empire State Building and New York Public Library, back to hotel\"\\nYou\\'re backtracking too much. I would probably eat after you finish on your cruise. Though I wonder if you are visiting Ellis Island or just cruising by it?\\nI\\'m also worried that you are not buffering enough time for your Broadway show. You don\\'t want to risk being late.\\n\"Rockefeller Center/St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral/Trump Tower/Pulitzer Fountain\" why are you doing this in the morning and TOTR later that day? Start over in Central Park and the Met instead then do all those other things together. I agree your days are a bit ambitious. You may also be underestimating how tired you might get. Overall I would do the things that are most important to you in the morning when you\\'re fresh. There are changes I would make that are more preference than right or wrong.\\nThe ferry to the Statue is in the same area as the things you plan on your arrival day. I would try to do some of those on the same day rather than going to that area 2 days in a row. I also think you\\'re going to be tired on day 1 having likely woken very early. So I would either plan fewer things on day 1 (maybe BRooklyn Bridge walk and Chinatown and save the rest for after the Statue) or do things closer to your hotel. You\\'ve got waaay too much on day 2 when you\\'re going to the theater. Leave yourself time to go back to the hotel and freshen up.\\nOne area you’ve totally left out is Greenwich Village which looks very different from the other areas. Most people love it.\\nEdited: 11:13 am, August 27, 2021 I don’t think day #1 is that unrealistic - but as Whiz has pointed out, it depends on your energy level. It also depends on how much time you plan to spend at the various Lower Manhattan destinations. I consider most quick walk-throughs/walk-bys, but then, I live here…as a visitor you may want to linger.\\nI think that evening is actually a perfect time to walk the Brooklyn Bridge. Temperatures should be pleasant & you can admire the skyline all lit up.\\nI’d note that much of your itinerary involves walking outside, which is great - the best way to see & experience the city - but puts you at the mercy of the weather. A few rain/extreme heat “plan B’s” might be useful. Thank you for your time and help!! :)\\nI have made changes to the itinerary based on your comments. Any suggestions are very welcomed!\\nDay 1 Tue 28 Sep do something near the hotel just in case I am tired :)\\nFly into LGA.

Make sure to leave time to go the the 9/11 memorial. Also One World Trade Center is pretty impressive to go up and tour. IMO it’s a abetter experience to Empire State. For Day 1, you won’t get to hotel until around 1:00. After checking in and leaving luggage you won’t be at lunch until around 2:00. After lunch and walk to Met you will not arrive until close to 4:00 and I think it closes at 5:00… check the hours. An hour is not enough time there to be worth it. Plan on 1.5 hours for Top of the Rock so how many other things you will be able to see will depend on how late of night you want to have.\\nPlan at least 4-5 hours for SOL and Ellis Island. Security, waiting for cruise and cruise itself takes at least an hour. Ellis Island is an amazing museum and will take at least 2 hours to properly tour. If you do museum at SOL too plan an hour for that stop. Thank you everyone for your time and help! Looks like I\\'ll have to change the itinerary again, I couldn\\'t do everything I would like to do with limited time, so I\\'ll visit this area again in the future. Please see below, does it look better now? Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!\\nDay 1 Tue 28 Sep\\nFly into LGA.

Maybe schedule some time to rest (unless you are a very active/energetic person) or to recover from jet lag?\\nLooking forward to hearing your trip report. :) Looks good. :)\\nI don\\'t think jetlag is going to be an issue. If they aren\\'t morning people, the time difference should factor in but it\\'s just a 1 hour difference. I’m at a restaurant talking to people from Peru. They need to get tested for travel - what’s the best/cheapest/fastest place for them to go to. They are flying back on Sunday. Sounds like they should have planned their trip better.\\nCity MD for starters. https://pe.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/\\nAccording to US Embassy Peru (couldn\\'t readily find on website of Peru embassy US) EVERYONE entering Peru, incl Peruvians, needs, at time of boarding, negative result of either antigen test in past 24 hours or molecular test in past 72 hrs. I think latter genlly takes too long for them to get results of a Sat test, so should probably just get antigen test somewhere Sat or Sun within that 24 hr window. I gave them City MD and the place jcmtl went to. Don’t need scolding. Just trying to help people. They need a test. Hopefully a cheap one. No one is scolding you Risa. I commented on their lack of planning, which is evident.\\nYou helped them by providing them with an option. I used LabQ for testing which has trucks all over the city nd was free. Unfortunately I think Saturday is the day most of them are closed. My emergency backup plan was covid testing at JFK with Adams Medical. You can get the results in 1 to 3 hours. Not sure if they are using JFK or another airport but other airports may offer testing as well. An antigen test shouldn\\'t take hours. I have \\'t had one, but it\\'s my understanding it\\'s usually more like 15-30 minutes, while you wait. They would just need to make sure it wasn\\'t more than 24 hrs before boarding. In any event, they should ask whatever facilities they are considering, to be sure. By the way I have both a CIty MD and a MedRite in my neighborhood, practically across the street from each other. For reasons unclear to me, for the past couple of weeks there have been long lines outside the MedRite and none outside the City MD. I\\'ve heard people talking about false positives from antigen tests. I know it is being investigated. I wouldn\\'t rely on antigen test as a false positive can really screw people up. For these people from Peru the other test may not be an option if they can\\'t get results fast enough for flight. With the antigen test, my understanding is if you test positive they do it a second time and if that is positive too then they go to the other test to confirm. Since I started getting occasional Covid tests again, I\\'ve noticed that the hospital near me (in the NYC-Gotham network) does PCR tests that give results by early the next morning. But the testing site is closed on weekends. But there must be PCR sites in Manhattan that give next-day results even on weekends, right?\\nEdited: 2:05 am, September 04, 2021 Going to a Yankee game from Manhattan on a Sat and am getting a little concerned about cramming into a subway car after the game. Are people on the subway wearing masks? Other good options? You\\'re going to get the rare few that will not have a mask on, it\\'s going to happen.\\nSubway is the best way to go in my opinion. If 10% of the people on the subway aren\\'t wearing masks, that\\'s still a significant number of people on a crowded subway car.\\nThat said, the subways do have really good air exchange Metro North has a stop at Yankee Stadium as well, those trains go to Grand Central, I dont know the costs I\\'d take metro north. Better chance of the mask mandate being enforced. Bunch of people coming from a ballgame that have been drinking and then cramming into a subway train? I\\'m sure you will have more than a few not wearing masks. If it\\'s important to you that the people around you wear masks, I agree Metro North is likely a better option than the subway.\\nHere\\'s a link to where you can look up Metro North schedules: http://as0.mta.info/mnr/schedules/sched_form.cfm\\nMetro North is a commuter rail system that extends into the suburbs and follows a schedule.\\nI\\'m guessing they run extra trains on game days, but I\\'m not 100% on that one. One general hint is that the ends of the trains tend to be less crowded than the middle. I have noticed everyone wearing a mask on the #7 train, but Flushing is different from other places. Hi,\\nWe are heading to NYC tonight. I’m wondering if flooding is impacting Broadway. It says our show is still on? You will be fine, broadway was not Flooded, the only parts of Manhattan that was flooded was the FDR / Harlem River Drive which is next to the East River and that always floods Some ongoing public transit delays but most of the system seems to be back https://new.mta.info/\\nDepending on how you\\'re getting to NYC you should check airport or road conditions No impact at all. Waitress posted some video of water in the theatre, but the show went on. The show must go on. https://www.earthcam.com/cams/newyork/timessquare/?cam=tsrobo1\\nTake a look at a live cam in Times Sq. The area will be packed later...especially during the long weekend.\\nNYC always bounces back! You can\\'t even tell it rained in NYC. It is such a non-issue for tourists. Wow glad to hear that it didn\\'t affect every part of the city. Aside from the fact it was a lot more rain this time due to those 2 systems intersecting, I wonder how they explain fact that much of NYC, very densely populated areas, did not flood despite fact our sewer system \"only\" designed to handle 1.75 in of rain an hour. I think much of it (whether in NYC or out in country, which also got hit hard) had to do with construction in low lying areas prone to flooding -- much in areas that historically flood, just worse this time. Think of all the places one usually hears about when it rains that also flooded, only worse, this time -- Mamaroneck, Bronx River Parkway, FDR Drive. Parts of Williamsburg and other low-lying parts of Brooklyn, parts of Queens (one resident there interviewed yesterday said \"It always floods here and the city never does anything about it\"), parts of Staten Island. What was different for me this time was extent of failure in subway system and deaths in basement apts not certified for occupancy. Subways I attribute to infrastructure that has obviously been failing for a long. The basement apt thing I attribute more to total failure of bldgs dept and other city leadership to do anything about them. They have long been known to be fire traps. To just shrug their shoulders and say \"well we do have an affordable housing crisis\" is no longer acceptable, but I guess in meantime you could blame affordable housing crisis for what happened there.\\nEdited: 3:02 pm, September 03, 2021 My neighborhood was pretty badly flooded and I do not live in a Flood Zone, The people who got flooded where those with inground Basements, Because the ground was already saturated from Hurricane Henri a couple of weeks ago, there was no place for this water to go. Thankfully my basement is not underground so I didnt have a big problem When I was a child, in the 50\\'s, the catch basins at my corner (101st Street and Central Park West), were cleaned as often as twice a year, using a dump truck fitted with a low-tech, purpose-shaped clamshell scoop device.\\nToday, politicians have gotten the message of \"no more taxes or you\\'re out of your cushy job.\" So catch basins (and West Side Highway drains) are not cleaned until the water rises above chest level. Neglect of infrastructure and failure to do basic maintenance may be related, but they are not the same thing. We might sneer at a homeowner who doesn\\'t clean his gutters out, or lubricate his door lock before the winter. Why do we, effectively, order politicians do omit the same sort of work?\\nAn interesting issue about sketch basement apartments is that they are \"taxpayers\" (that is, necessary income generators) for marginal homeowners. It is hard to prosecute \"landlords\" for renting them out when it appears to be oppression of people who .... maybe .... should not own an apartment or a building. But we are determined to offer home ownership to anyone. I agree on the clogged drains (I try to remember to check my terrace drain before the big rains). In the middle of the storm there was a TV guy standing in an intersection up in Washington Heights. He was going on and on about how the intersection was flooding. While he was talking some guys in high vis vests came out and swept the drain free of junk and papers that had been blocking it and the street cleared\\nTo the extent there is any flooding in my hood, it is generally those lakes that form at intersections because of clogged drains.. A browse through the flood maps is interesting https://www1.nyc.gov/site/floodmaps/maps/overview.page\\nI think in many places development may not have been done with many current hazards in mind (floods, wildfires, droughts etc.)\\nHoward - IIRC home owners in flood zones are often required to have the supplemental flood insurance (maybe a condition for the mortgage?). Is that correct?\\nI suspect the illegal apartment thing is similar to the short term rental problem - driven by complaints as much/more as inspections Howard you described what happened to my in ground basement, due to saturated soil all around, and despite having a working french drain and sump pump system, when it was coming down like crazy water started flowing through my cellar doors, down the steps, across the room and into the drain for the sewer line.\\nNever saw that before. According to the graphics posted here, my area probably saw 7 or 8 inches of rain - we usually get what Newark, NJ, does weatherwise.\\nEdited: 3:47 pm, September 03, 2021 #6 I believe new flood zone maps were drawn up post-Sandy but they are still maybe \"proposed\" because there is huge opposition to them from property owners who would now be forced to buy flood insurance, something they aren\\'t/weren\\'t required to do under the pre-Sandy maps. Obviously, it\\'s much cheaper to let the government pay for your repairs in a disaster than to have to pay for flood insurance that would cover a disaster you aren\\'t 100% sure will happen while you own the property. (Even better to get the state to buy it at its pre-storm market value, as was the case with a number of Staten Island property owners after Sandy.)\\nEdited: 6:37 pm, September 03, 2021 In proper real estate speak and city law, a basement is half or more above ground level and might be used for habitation with the proper permits. Places that are half or more below ground are cellars and may not be used as living space. Unfortunately, there are homeowners that make these illegal conversions and rent them to those who have few options or even complaining because of their immigration status. It is all a matter of greed. I suspect many are counting on their insurance to cover damages and may have an unhappy discovery. Depending on the policy, and reading the fine print is important, a flood incident might be required to come from a river, ocean, etc. and not just runoff from heavy rain. If a house is damaged by a leaking or damaged roof, that is normally covered by storm benefits. \"Obviously, it\\'s much cheaper to let the government pay for your repairs in a disaster than to have to pay for flood insurance that would cover a disaster you aren\\'t 100% sure will happen while you own the property.\"\\nThis is incorrect; many people in my area (which had 2 100 year, catastrophic floods 5 years apart 2006, 2011) who had never needed flood insurance and therefore did not have it and lost or had major damage to their homes received a fraction of the replacement costs. These coasts were based on what FEMA calculated. The 100 year designation is important because it is the trigger for redrawing the maps:\\nhttps://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/40564.html\\nEdited: 7:51 pm, September 03, 2021 https://youtu.be/dVTmCynlCFU\\nI have noticed a few soon to be visitors asking if nYc is ok....if they should delay their visit in the upcoming days...if headed to Broadway is ok.....\\nTake a look at the above vid from last night. A storm, terrorist attack, blackout, pandemic, etc. will never hold nYc down!\\nWe are tougher than that! Always have been...always will be!\\nCome and enjoy! Agree! Thanks for posting. So true.\\nThis time of the year always brings concerns for hurricanes or remnants of them. We\\'ve had so many of these types of storms over the years, granted the amount of water in such a short time made this one a bit different. Hi, Hows everyone in NYC? The pictures and videos were awful. We arrive in NYC on Sunday afternoon. Are the touristy places still open? Here is our itinerary, please see we have 8 yr old kids along so trying to decide if we need to push the travel or is it still doable?\\nSunday- St Patricks , TOTR @sunset, Times square,\\nMonday -  central park , Roosevelt Tram, Lego store , bloomingdales\\nTuesday -  brooklyn bridge walk, dumbo \\nWed -   edge , the vessel, chelsea market; pass by High line\\nThursday - Statue of Liberty , battery park, carousel,  911 memorial, Wall street, \\nWe plan to shuffle it up considering weather. You will be fine. No need to push back. Re your itinerary...\\n-The Vessel is closed. If you are going for a photo op, I might reconsider.\\n-You are going to the TOTR, R Tram, Brooklyn Bridge and Edge. That is a lot of viewing NYC from up above over 5 days.\\nDon\\'t forget to just walk around the various neighborhoods in the city. Some events taking place:\\n-Washington Sq Park outdoor art fest. A great event and reason to visit the area.\\n-Coney Island \"end\" of summer weekend\\n-Bryant Park movies\\nJust my $.02.\\n- ***You will be fine. No need to push back.***\\nExactly, come and enjoy. https://www.earthcam.com/cams/newyork/timessquare/?cam=tsrobo1\\nTake a look at a live cam in Times Sq. The area will be packed later...especially during the long weekend.\\nNYC always bounces back! #2. I read vessel is closed now but i added that just thinking its closer to The Edge and if I am around the neighborhood then might as well check it from below. We will be walking on the BB to experience it. My kids are excited to see the tall buildings (we are from Dallas lol)\\nThanyou all for the encouragement. We are really looking forward to experience NYC. Definitely check out the buildings. I didn\\'t meant advise against. Just makes sure you take some time to just walk around and \"hang out\"! Everything is fine in NYC. How is it there in Dallas? Seriously though the city is already back to normal. Almost all the subway lines are running regular service now and the one or two lines that have water issues are partial service and those stations that are being skipped aren\\'t likely to be ones tourists would even be using in the first place. NYC is incredibly resilient, so there is really no reason to have any concerns. The storm is gone and the transit issues have been addressed. Yes, the Vessel is closed again. They tried restricting entry to groups, but a teenage male while with his family, took the jump. It will probably require serious heightening of the sides that will be both expensive and time-consuming.\\nAlong 57th St., there are \"supertall buildings that are very thin.\\nEdited: 2:26 pm, September 03, 2021 Dont pass by the High Line, Walk the High Line, its right by the bottom of the Edge anyway. You walk the High Line from the Chelsea market to the Edge As of today, the subway is already mostly back. Anything else that was majorly affected by the flooding (namely basement apartments :( ) won\\'t have much affect on tourists.\\nI know a small venue or two that is temporarily closed due to flooding from roof leaks, but nothing that would have a noticeable affect on tourists.\\nEdited: 2:45 pm, September 03, 2021 All recommendations wanted. Preferably a place with GREAT side items like lobster mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts, etc. Also would like great appetizers People ask this question ALL of the time...and over the next day or so, you will get a bunch of responses which say: \"Keen\\'s\" \"Peter Lugar\\'s\" \"Wolfgang\\'s\" Minetta Tavern\" \"Del Frisco\" .... you will have no idea who has actually eaten at more than one of them and has a basis of comparison (and how long ago), or whether their tastes match yours.\\nIf I were you, I would go through any of the many lists of \"best steakhouse in NYC\" and check menus to see if they have the side dishes you are interested in. THEN, maybe, come back here with your narrowed down list and ask for opinions. At least you will know the menus are intriguing to you. And yes, that\\'s what I do. I personally do not rely on random recommendations from people whose qualifications I don\\'t know - I go to restaurant websites, read menus, and after I have narrowed it down, maybe I will ask (and maybe I will just read reviews). Some people will tell you if they\\'re familiar with all of the restaurants they comment on, some will just make it sound like they are. There is really only one person on this Board that I will rely on without additional research, and a few others that I will follow up on their recommendations. If you don\\'t know who has similar tastes to you, random names don\\'t matter. Of course, it\\'s more labor intensive. But for me, worth it. Great suggestion Rosa. Thanks and I will do that One of the better steak houses that aren\\'t as touristy as others is the Bowery Meat Company. I don\\'t know if they\\'ll have a Christmas dinner but many restaurants do. The Tomahawk Ribeye is a recommendedation for two people. Maybe keep them in mindto look into as Christmas approaches.\\nhttps://www.bowerymeatcompany.com/\\nAnother one to also look into is American Cut, TriBeCa. They also have an uptown location on E56th St.\\nhttps://www.americancutsteakhouse.com/location/american-cut-tribeca/\\nhttps://eatingwithziggy.com/2016/02/15/american-cut-an-american-review/ Where are you staying? Hi all,\\nAfter having our trip cancelled/rebooked several times due to the pandemic, it is now booked for May 2022 - whether or not we get to go, the same as everyone else I obviously have no idea.\\nBeing optimistic - if we are able to travel, myself and partner are both fully vaccinated, however my children are not (10 & 15), will this be an issue? I know some countries are allowing those who are not vaccinated to take tests etc prior to entry, is this the same so far in America? I know those travelling from the U.K. currently cannot enter, but was wondering if those from other places have the option to enter if they have not had the vaccine?\\nTIA There isn\\'t a person alive who can tell you what the rules will be for vaccinations/negative tests/masks/etc 8 months out from now.\\nThe current rules will change at least 4 times between now and then, including allowing more (younger) people to be vaccinated, third shots, boosters, etc.\\nCurrently non-vaccinated folks from some places can enter the US\\nEdited: 9:20 am, September 03, 2021 I could be wrong here, but right now I think the only unvaccianted people allowed in the US are citizens or legal residents of the US. That might also include spouses of such people **There isn\\'t a person alive who can tell you what the rules will be for vaccinations/negative tests/masks/etc 8 months out from now.**\\n+1 Howard unvaccinated Canadians can enter by air, have been allowed to for a long time. Things change day to day sometimes, no way we can even imagine May 2022 at this point. >>>Currently non-vaccinated folks from some places can enter the US<<<\\nTrue.\\ntrip girl 2017, My advice is to remain positive & plan as if you will be able to enter with your children ,but of course with refundable bookings as much as possible or entirely .\\nThere’s power in thinking positively. I truly believe the world will get back to normal someday, but we must be patient and take precautions in the meantime and not dwell on what we cannot do.\\nEdited: 10:41 am, September 03, 2021 Thankyou all.\\nCamino I totally agree, positivity is definitely key!\\nOur holiday which consists of 3 nights NYC and then 17 Orlando has been booked since 2018, and obviously cancelled / rebooked and so on. Unfortunately the whole lot is paid, including Orlando park tickets etc, and I don’t believe there will be the option of a refund (unless it’s all cancelled by the operators) - so at the minute I’m feeling very uneasy lol! However, I’m aware lots of people are in the same situation as me and I guess it’s just an ongoing waiting game!\\nFor those who mention holiday insurance - yes we have annual trip insurance, however when the holiday was rescheduled the first time round the insurance became void due to me ‘booking a holiday’ during the pandemic, although I didn’t actually book a holiday I rescheduled a holiday. Was wrong to assume it would have just carried over, But hey it is what it is! These are the current guidelines, my understanding is that they\\'re rules for non-residents flying into then out of the USA (for citizens that are not on the banned countries list), and for USA residents returning from overseas.\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html\\nAnd these are the current rules for NYC specifically:\\nhttps://www.nycgo.com/coronavirus-information-and-resources-for-travelers\\nMy bet is that the rules will be basically the same by May 2022.\\nEdited: 7:02 pm, September 03, 2021 Is PayPal accepted in stores or bars as payment? I\\'ve not seen it in stores, only on internet purchases. I try to avoid it as the establishment you\\'re using doesn\\'t get the whole amount - PayPal takes a cut. Never heard of it for brick&mortar purchases.\\nEdited: 1:52 pm, September 03, 2021 On occasion, you may see it at places geared to younger people or I’ve seen a bartender post that tips are accepted that way. Ive never seen it except maybe a pop up shop Venmo is more likely to be accepted than PayPal. Venmo is taken at some food trucks, or by smaller venders, or at some bars or clubs geared towards a younger crowd. That said, I wouldn\\'t count on it; not everywhere takes it.

For me, I know that visiting a museum is top on my list of relaxing events. With so many things to do in NYC, what are some things that you do to relax in NYC (either as a visitor or a native)? Not to dump on this post, but this post is really tone deaf. We just had major flooding and a lot of people are suffering , ASking what is relaxing at this moment is not really appropirate I like to walk slowly in Central Park (and get lost in Central Park), or sit in any park.\\nI also find visits to book stores, any book store, very relaxing. What is a relaxing day for you in San Francisco?\\nNYC is not a relaxing place, it is the Type A capital of the world. I\\'m quite sure it\\'s where \"work hard, play hard\" was invented. For locals, relaxing usually means getting OUT of NYC. Otherwise, we\\'re multi-tasking (how we don\\'t all kill each other while texting and walking is a mystery, avoiding people doing that is a highly developed skill of mine). As for activities designed to \"relax\" are you really asking about spas and massages? Pampering activities? Concerts and lectures? Simulated golf? Having a cocktail? Renting a bike? Is any of that so different from San Francisco?\\nMany tourists describe enjoying sitting in parks and reading, you\\'ve been on this forum for many months, I\\'m sure you\\'ve read trip reports where people mention that. I don\\'t find it particularly relaxing to do that - if I sit down (pretty rare), it\\'s because I have a blister or need to read an email or take a phone call. (I don\\'t eat much street food) Not to \"relax\". I walk a lot. But I don\\'t know if that\\'s \"relaxing\"\\nEdited: 5:39 pm, September 02, 2021 ***Not to dump on this post, but this post is really tone deaf. We just had major flooding and a lot of people are suffering , ASking what is relaxing at this moment is not really appropirate***\\nHave to agree with Howard here. Have to disagree with Risa - maybe it’s partly a Manhattan/Brooklyn difference…there are certainly many (too many!) “type A” people in Brooklyn, but a lot of people are pretty chill. On nice days, half the Borough appears to be relaxing by smoking weed in the park (I jest, but not entirely). Most people I know do in fact find ways to relax in the city.\\nFor me, that means walking on a beach (Fort Tilden being my favorite, though Plumb will suffice) or going to the park. I’m a birder, so I generally have binoculars with me, but if I weren’t, I’d bring a book or a magazine. Or just watch people go by.\\nPre-pandemic, I was big on sitting in coffee shops, but don’t do that these days. Linda, it’s your Midwestern sensibility! I did not mean to offend anyone with this post. My apologies if this post comes across as insensitive. That was not my intention.\\nEdited: 6:15 pm, September 02, 2021 Still curious why you think “relaxing” in NYC is different from SF. To me, it’s unique to the person, not necessarily the location.\\n(To wit: Linda, is Brooklyn the only place you go birdwatching? Is there something about NYC that makes it more special than any other place? And I love a good Beach. But I would so much prefer beaches found outside of city limits, I would imagine someone from California knows good beaches). No offense taken, Travel Chick (from someone who spent part of the day cleaning up their building\\'s basement and sorting through water-logged possessions).\\nMaybe it\\'s my Midwestern sensibility, maybe it\\'s the fact that I\\'m retired, but I don\\'t think so. One of the things that struck me from the time I moved here is just how much time people spend just hanging out. Yes, of course there are people who walk down the street with their eyes locked on their cell phones, or have intense work conversations through their airpods (or both at the same time). But there are also plenty of people who stroll, play cards or dominos in the park, chat with friends, sunbathe naked . . . whatever floats your boat.\\nOnce again, it shows that there\\'s no one type of New Yorker or New York experience. Im not a birder, but I think the best place to go Birding is in Queens, specifically Broad Channel (Gateway Natonal Recreation Area) , Alot of Migratory bird stop in that area on their trip south.\\nIm with Risa on leaving NYC to relax especially the Beach, When I mean Beach I dont mean Coney Island, I mean either Jones Beach or More Likely Robert Moses State Park (Fire Island).\\nWhat OP doesnt understand about museums, for example If I want to go to the Met, I have to get to the Subway, then take 2 trains to get their, the 2 most crowded lines in the system where I have to stand on both of them and then walk about 5-6 blocks from the Subway to the Museum. it will take about an hour, Its actually quite stressful to get there\\nif I want to relax, Ill sit on my chair watching the Mets (OK maybe this isnt so relaxing with the team collpasing) or the Giants on the television I hope everyone is OK, if you are travelling in NYC area today, dont be stupid and go back to your place for the evening. No tourist site is worth getting stuck or getting hurt\\nThis is not normal rain for NYC, I think this was even harder than what we got last week from Hurricane Henri. Im not sure I ever remember it raining this hard before Sitting here at home in the Village watching the rain and lightning.\\nCH Yes, I think Central Park got about 3 in between 9 and 10 PM, while max hourly in Henri was just under 2 in. I wish there was a way to send this rain to California. At 10.41 PM MTA posted notice on website telling people to avoid traveling by subway or commuter rail tonight because of limited service caused by heavy rain and flooding. I was in DC today for a meeting...it was abruptly ended at a little after 1:30ish, when some of the people were afraid they couldn\\'t drive home to VA...I was going to wait it out in DC and get dinner there, but instead jumped on the next Acela (which was $30 more than the Regional). The train pulled in at 5:50, I was home at 6:15. And with all of the scaffolding between my subway stop and apartment, I was barely wet. Thanks Howard, it\\'s been coming down heavy for the past few hours. Some thunder and lightning as well.\\nHopefully it\\'s gone by tomorrow morning, as they are predicting. I\\'m glad I\\'m not on the subway tonight: https://twitter.com/Nywah/status/1433259660820328450 I can\\'t imagine stepping off a train into something like that. There is also video on Twitter showing people standing on seats of a bus in Queens as it drove through flood waters described by one Tweeter as 3 or 4 ft deep. Yeah, not a good night to be anywhere underground. I have visited multiple times, teen daughter has been there once, husband and son are 1st timers.\\nSohotel is $75 more for 3 beds but I know there is no elevator. Will visit Tenement Museum, Ellis Island/SOL, maybe 911 Memorial. Desire to be near Greenwich Village.\\nThank you! I have no experience with Sohotel. I\\'ve had many good stays at the Four Points Soho though it has been a few years. However, the rooms are quite small so if you are 4 in one room it would be very tight. Susie not sure how we can help. That 4 Points says they have rooms with 2 queens rather than more typical doubles, but there is no floor space even if one of the kids wanted to sleep in a sleeping bag. So only you can decide whether the extra money is worth having an extra bed. There are other hotels in Soho, the lower east side.where the tenement museum is and lots in Tribeca and the financial district.\\nThe Moxy East Village has become very popular on the forum and they have bunkbed rooms with 4 single beds.

Maybe given the extreme nature of the flooding it will take 48 hours for the subway to be back to normal but it is extremely unlikely that a week from now there will be any noticeable impact from this. New Jersey Transit trains are all shut down and Amtrak is having major problems. I was thinking of a trip to the Jersey Shore on Friday, but this is now in question. Commuter trains to Grand Central are not running unless this has recently changed.

This way you can add the ones you have time for at your pace during days with great visibility. With the Go City Explorer Pass you buy a pass for a certain number of attractions and have 60 days after activation to use it. A four attraction pass is $112.\\nFor each attraction, check the \"Know before you go\" section for information about how to get in. For example, you can make a reservation for the Empire State Building, but for One World Observatory, \"present your pass at the One World Observatory Box Office to receive the next available timed ticket.\"\\nhttps://gocity.com/new-york/en-us/products/explorer/how-it-works It looks like that go City is the one, Looks like I have 60 days to use it and it costs $112 for 4 attractions. Meaning I don\\'t have to rush all 4 in 1 or 2 days\\nIn case I cant do them all in one day, I can do the next week and finish it off.\\nI can pick and choose days more than tourists can, so I can go on the nice days without issue Read the fine print, make sure the admissions are regular admissions.\\nI agree that you can go in whenever you\\'d like, but even as someone that can do the same, I find it a bit exciting to take on 4 observatories in the same day. What\\'s good about that is comparing photos, the light, sky, etc. will be relatively the same for equal comparison. Considering a trip 10/14-10/19. I have visited multiple times, teen daughter has been there once, husband and son are 1st timers.\\nI take the small room and no view reviews with a grain of salt as that is exactly what I expect. Will mostly use room for sleeping only - budget and proximity to Central Park priority.\\nHusband, myself, and 2 full sized teenagers.\\nConsidering\\nLa Quinta CP - noticed it on my last trip - would get 2 queen rooms\\n6 Columbus - could do 1 room\\nHotel Belleclaire -could do 1 room\\nOther suggestions?\\nMpst recently have stayed at Affinia 50 and Hampton Inn Chelsea.\\nWe will likely do a split stay of UWS and then somewhere in the Greenwich Village area. Better nights to stay in 1 of these areas over another?\\nThank you! La Quinta NO. Not safe. Look at Arthouse and the Newton. Not sure how you can do 1 room at 6 Columbus but it\\'s a nice hotel. I see no reason to move hotels for a 5 night visit plus there are very few hotels in the village. Arthouse. Our room was huge by NYC standards. 2 queen beds and a sofa bed plus plenty of walking around space. It might be outside of your budget but they do run sales. They do charge an extra nightly fee (like a \"resort\" fee or whatever wording they use). It\\'s a great base for the UWS though. My adult kids like the Beacon. I think the Belleclaire is still closed. Thanks everyone. I booked the Beacon. Hi,\\nMy husband and I (30s) are coming to NYC next month for 3 nights, it will be his first trip and I\\'ve been a handful of times, but havn\\'t been to the city since 2016, so I\\'ll be his tour guide basically. We are staying in LIC, I\\'ve stayed in LIC a couple times before and have no qualms riding the subway into the city, I want to show him some of the boroughs too. Arriving in and out of LGA.\\nWe arrive noon time on a Saturday, planning on taking subway to our hotel. Then was planning on hitting the Midtown sights; Grand Central Station, Times Sq, Bryant Park, Madison Sq Park, possibly down to Washington Sq Park - time depending. Any recs for a rooftop bar?\\nOn the Sunday, I was thinking a nice brunch somewhere, preferably outside sidewalk dining watching the world go by - any recs? Then going to Coney Island, want to ride the Cyclone (regret not doing it on previous trips), hit up Nathans, Rubys, make our way back to the city, stopping in DUMBO for pizza, Brooklyn Bridge Park area, walk the bridge back into the city.\\nMonday - Central Park day, checking out Zabars, Grays Papaya, and Levains too. Then we have tickets for the Yankees game that night, my husband wants to try a chopped cheese, unsure whether to get from just any bodega or go to Blue Sky Deli ? -- also my husband is very intrigued by bodegas and wants bacon, egg and cheeses for breakfast, I imagine there should be plenty of bodegas around our hotel in LIC.\\nTues - Our flight leaves at 7pm. Plan on exploring Lower Manhattan that day, Staten Island Ferry, High Line, Greenwich Village, SoHo, Tribeca, Chinatown etc.., want to check out the new Little Island.\\nAny thoughts? Better days to do certain things?\\nInterests are sightseeing, exploring, breweries, good eats, baseball, soaking in the city. Since you haven\\'t been here since 2016 consider taking ferry.nyc from LIC to Wall Street for your downtown day. You\\'ll both love it. https://ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/astoria/ Saturday sounds OK. Rooftop bars in Midtown to look into are Bar 54 rooftop, Electric Lemon, Elsie Rooftop bar, Mandarin Oriental Lobby Bar, Refinery Rooftop, Spyglass, The Roof, Top of the Strand. If you want one in LIC I was going to suggest Savanna Rooftop but I think it might be closed.\\nSunday sounds too busy to me. And very tiring.\\nMonday sounds OK.\\nTuesday sounds way too busy for a departure day. I\\'d cut out a few things that aren\\'t must-do\\'s. I think you’re trying to accomplish too much. What time do you arrive on Sat.? Which hotel in LIC?\\nCentral Park is more fun on weekends with buskers and activity but you may not care.\\nBtw, it will take you 2-3 times as long to get to LIC from LGA than if you take a cab. You have to take a bus to the subway. LGA is 10-15 mins from LIC by car. FWIW, I\\'d have your husband lead the trip in New York. Have him select where to go, what to see, places to visit, etc., including transportation. You just follow along and maybe suggest alternatives, as this sounds like it\\'ll be his first trip. Letting him lead will be a great (fun) experience for him. I hope you both have a great time!\\nEdited: 11:54 am, September 01, 2021 Sunday\\nInstead of going to Manhattan, Just go to the Time out Cafe in Brooklyn, Its near Brooklyn Bridge park, You can watch people there, Just as many as almost anywhere in Manhattan, then go to Coney Island I think there are Bodegas in Queens Plaza in Long Island City, LIC has become very upscale recently and that means less Bodegas Re: #3…the bus to the subway is really no big deal; if traffic is light it takes 10 minutes (think of it as an Airtrain on wheels), and if traffic is heavy, well, a taxi would be stuck in it too. But a lot depends on where the LIC hotel is…if it’s not close to one of the lines that serve the Jackson Hts station, I’d be tempted to take a taxi, too (and I’m a huge public transit booster who pretty much always takes the subway to/from LGA).\\nRe: your Sunday…for brunch, for efficiency’s sake, I’d pick something near whichever train you’ll be using to get to Coney Island (could be a nice way to take in another neighborhood). That means quite a wide swathe of Manhattan and Brooklyn come into play. For instance, if the F is convenient for you, you could hop off on the Lower East Side and go somewhere there…or continue on to Bergen or Carroll Sts in Brooklyn (tons of spots along Smith St)…or to Park Slope/Windsor Terrace. I’m not a big brunch person so don’t really have specific recommendations. (I do like Krupa Grocery a lot, but I think a lot of their seating is in their back garden rather than on the street.)\\nOr if you want to go a different, more informal route & it’s a nice day - check out Smorgasburg in Prospect Park and make a picnic of it. Definitely high quality people-watching in the park!\\nOh, and while it’s not my stomping ground, I don’t think you’ll have any problem finding Bodega BECs in LIC. Forgot to mention…you’ve probably researched this already, but there are a bunch of craft microbreweries in LIC and Brooklyn. Two Brooklyn breweries that would be near the F train - and therefore within striking distance on your Coney Island Day - are Other Half (assuming you like IPSs) and Folksbier. Then there’s the Coney Island Brewery, right on Surf Av by the stadium. LInda, every time I\\'ve checked google maps for time to travel between LGA and several different LIC hotels, it says 15 mins to drive and anywhere from 30-60 + mins for bus/subway.\\nTo OP, look at what things you can do at night to maximize your time. Coney Island could be fun at night. Thanks guys.\\nWe land 12:30pm LGA, annoyingly our flight time got pushed back. Staying at Hyatt Place LIC, our closest subway is Queensboro Plaza. It looks as if it’s 30mins either public trans or taxi. I forgot about the bus, I was thinking JFK/AirTrain in my head.\\nMaybe we should switch our Central Park day to our departure day, and then do our downtown neighborhoods on the Monday, just the 7pm baseball would restrict us - that whys I thought Central Park paired well with the baseball.\\nThen I thought Coney Island would be better on a weekend, and our evening/night activity would be DUMBO, Brooklyn Bridge. Though Sunday could be our better day to do Greenwich Village etc…\\nDefinitely interested in hitting up some of the breweries in the city, have only been to Brooklyn Brewery before.\\nThe ferry from LIC to Downtown sounds great - but would two ferry rides in one day be too much? And time consuming, we’d probably end up doing them back to back, which seems silly and then we’d make our way up Manhattan. The new ferry sounds great to me, but I know my husband wants to see the Statue of Liberty. It\\'s not quite sublim yet, Ryan Sutton says;\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/22650875/eleven-madison-park-review-vegan-menu-dishes-price-2021 Well. that was an interesting read.\\nHis comment \"The finish is short and thin; it recalls a congee from a college grad who learned how to make the dish from an Instant Pot cookbook.\" was hysterical.\\nThe author mentions Dirt Candy. That was the least interesting meal I ate in my visits to NYC; my experience probably influenced by my high expectations. Most dishes were meh and the broccoli hotdog smothered in mustard inedible. We used to have a nice veggie place in Flushing called Happy Buddha. The dishes that tried to imitate meat were curious, but the best were those that made no attempt to hide that they were veggies. We agree with Emeril Lagasse when he says, \"pork fat rules!\"\\nCH Interesting.\\nI really loved the vegetarian (not the same as vegan, I know) at Per Se some years ago. That one was well worth the money. I am getting so hyped about my trip to NYC soon. I am building up my stamina as I became a sort of recluse during the pandemic and gained weight and slowed down in my walking. Slowly I am building back up so I can walk for a long time without getting too fatigued.\\nDuring a trip to NYC, what is the longest distance or time you think you have walked? I am planning to walk a lot, though go at my own pace so I don\\'t get winded or too tired too easily. I have heard that I need to make sure to walk fast when going up and down subway stairs, so I need to work on that. From about a mile past downtown FLushing to Forest Hills, about 6 Miles I also walked during the Blackout from the Javits Center across manhattan to the Queensboro Bridge, Across the Queensboro Bridge to about a mile past Queens Plaza We clocked 28 miles the weekend of July 4th (all on Saturday and Sunday), from the southern tip of Manhattan to 62nd and 2nd but mostly on the west side and going back and forth from there to the WTC area.\\nFlat ground and low humidity made it possible. And then I hitched a ride with someone (People were hitching rides during the blackout, Its not a normal thing in NYC) and my ride dropped me off about 1.5 Miles from my house.\\nI didnt get home until about 10pm I walk a lot and I don’t know what the furthest. I can remember one of my early trips with a friend we walked from battery Park up to Columbus Circle. I walk all over the place, Especially when I go with that particular friend. My friend is always telling me the mileage that we walked in one day but it’s not all in one shot ,it’s usually 10 miles or so.\\nYou may have heard you have to go fast of the subway stairs but I don\\'t think it a requirement.\\nStay at the side near the railing and people will go around you. Stopping on the stairs is a no no.\\nI can walk pretty fast on a level surface, but I have to go slow up stairs because of my asthma. If I rushed up the stairs I’d have to spend a few moments recuperating so I don’t.\\nIf it was an emergency I could go fast.\\nEdited: 2:35 pm, August 31, 2021 Does running count? If so 26 miles. 32 miles for the Great Saunter but I live here.\\nLongest is 42 miles in a day.\\nEdited: 4:06 pm, August 31, 2021 In my younger years, I once walked from the Met Museum to the Battery and then back up to Grand Central (perhaps 10 miles). I certainly would not make it today.\\nEdited: 5:05 pm, August 31, 2021 E 46th & 5th Ave to Williamsburg Around 30,000 steps. All around Dumbo in Brooklyn then we took the subway over to Union Square and walked up to 54th St along Broadway. Can any local new yorkers confirm if this hotel has opened back up?\\nWe are hopefully coming in December. If the borders reopen. I\\'m not local, but their booking website states the following\\nThe Redbury Hotel will be closed to the public through 30 SEPT 2021 and will not be accepting arrivals during that time. Cheers mate was checking and last I saw was for today. They keep pushing the reopening date back. Which is understandable if tourists aren\\'t allowed in yet. Hope Biden reopens the borders. I\\'m not hopeful for my October / November trip in all honesty.\\nProbably going to push my trip back to March 2022. (originally booked for April 2021). Ugh. I booked for December thinking we would be fine. Its for the wives 40th that was in Jan. Its not looking great at the moment. The virus is still causing massive problems. Need to pay the final installment at end of this month. This is the first time I (28F) am traveling abroad. Its a business trip which I am extending for travel.\\nMy main concerns are solo women\\'s safe places, logical itinerary, considering COVID travel regulations/restrictions, not so costly (I am thinking $100-$250 maybe but its flexible based on how safe it is). I am not sure what is considered low-range or hi-range over there. Some tips on this would be helpful too.\\nPlease recommend, what would be the best itinerary for solo women\\'s travel in the US with a B1 visa? I am open to visiting other visa-free countries as well with B1.\\nI am thinking Orlando > Miami > Bahamas > Cuba > Belize > Guatemala > Oaxaca > Guadalajara > New Orleans > Alabama > South Carolina > Denver > NY.\\nI am naive in making itineraries so I am not sure if this is the best logical route to go with. Basically, I want to have fun, should not be too exhausting and safe for solo women. I would appreciate it if you suggest the best possible itinerary. I am interested in culture, beaches, and a little bit of\\nThe duration of my stay could be 2-3 months. I am leaving in the 2nd week of May 2022 from India and the starting point in the US would be Orlando.\\nEdited: 1:19 pm, August 30, 2021 You do know that some of the places you mentioned are not in the US right?\\nYou should post questions on the forums for these other places.\\nAs for New York, as a female that travels solo there many times, it\\'s safe as long as you are aware of your surroundings and it also depends on how used you are to big cities.\\nIf you are specific about what you need in New York with a a US budget you will get good answers to help you plan.\\nFor the hotel, you will need to give your specific dates.\\nFor restaurants, the type of food you like and the budget you plan on spending.\\nFor attractions, the type of things you like to do (parks, museums, etc.)\\nYou will be safe in New York and this forum can really help you plan you trip to New York City. Once upon a time, there were \"women only\"ls, the Barbizon comes to mind. To the best of my knowledge, they don\\'t exist anymor (maybe religious institutions have temporary facilities). In a good hotel, if you let the management know your concerns, they watch out for you a bit. But generally, you don\\'t have anything to worry about as long as you are reasonably aware of your surroundings.\\nI once had an unfortunate (fairly minor) incident in a hotel that I had stayed at many, many times in South Beach. I let management know. I was amazed at how they watched out for me for the rest of my stay. Someone\\'s eyes were constantly on me, and a concierge offered to walk me to my room every time I re-entered the hotel. I didn\\'t need it, but I appreciated that they cared. So I understand your concern. If you want that kind of service, however, you will need to pay more for it. Start by posting this query on the Road Trips forum as they are the experts in multi city travel.\\nI also would suggest amending your profile to include a home country so that people have an idea of how to advise you based on where you\\'re coming from. New Orleans might not be a good idea for the next many months or year Thank you for the assurance.\\nYou do know that some of the places you mentioned are not in the US right? --- Correct, those places come under visa-free country to travel with B1 visa so I have added it to the list.\\nI was looking for concise advice that\\'s why I posted here and now I realized its just a NY forum!\\nAlthough I am not aware of the NY surrounding, I am from India and I have stayed solo in different cities here. Mostly in Mumbai and Delhi which are big cities here.\\nSo far there is no specific plan I have in mind just a general idea that I want to travel while working, take a month off to explore the city I like, and live a nomad life if that makes sense. I don\\'t mind going/staying to a few cities only for the quality of the experience.\\nFor Budget, I am thinking roughly $100 - $250 but I am not sure what is considered low/mid/high range over there. I am thinking $12-15k for the two-month trip.\\nI am not a fussy eater so I will be trying specialties in the localities I will be staying in. Expecting it to cover under the $15k budget.\\nFor attractions, parks, museums, beaches, trekking will do. A localite life in general.\\nOnce I have cities lined up, I can look for Airbnb or a hotel for specific dates. For now, the priority is to line up cities first and mode of travel. Which cities do you recommend between Orlando to NY? 2-3 cities will do.\\nOrlando is the starting point because that\\'s where my business trip will end. I didn\\'t know this works in NY too! That\\'s exactly what I do here! The locals get used to seeing you in their area within 2-3 days as you talk to them or ask questions and so does the hotel staff. Thanks for pointing out, that is something I will do. Fair enough! Thanks for the suggestion. I will post on the road trip forum. Damn! I so wanted to go over there. Read so much about it. :( “ New Orleans might not be a good idea for the next many months or year”\\nI’m not sure that will be the case. There was major flooding in some suburban areas. But the storm damage in the city is surprisingly not that bad.\\nIt just depends on how long it takes to get the power back on.\\nIf the 2-4 weeks estimate holds true, I think you’ll see tourism and other businesses rebounding by Halloween. Airbnb and similar are almost entirely illegal in NYC and many other places. you are more likely to be scammed in NYC than to find a legal airbnb in Manhattan, so stick to hotels or hostels. The end is near for our favorite hostelry after years of speculation. The poor dogs from the show at the Garden will have to find new digs. The demolition will likely bring many new \"visitors\" to nearby properties.\\nhttps://newyorkyimby.com/2021/08/updated-and-additional-renderings-for-foster-partners-1270-foot-supertall-penn-15-spotted-in-midtown-manhattan.html Bye bye. Don\\'t let the bedbugs bite. :P I would not stand anywhere close when it comes down 😅 My in-laws stayed there overnight after their wedding in 1974. They said it was in the beginning stages of becoming a dump. In all the times I have visited NYC, I never got the experience of staying at the Hotel Pennsylvania.\\nMaybe I missed something, I mean, I can\\'t leave a scathing review, or complain on here how bad it was, and didn\\'t ask before hand (i\\'m sure that\\'s been done).\\nM I was offered a job there in the mid 1980s\\nI needed the job\\nI turned down the job Northern - that\\'s funny My brother proposed staying there two years ago, based solely on location.\\nLuckily I lurk in this forum…. My father stayed there in the 1950\\'s and he said it was a dump at the time. Imagine now! Too bad Hotel Penn isn\\'t so architecturally gorgeous that more people might have been motivated to want to save it. But a luxury building probably would have been too expensive for the Pennsylvania Railroad to want to spend for its passengers arriving in NYC. The original interior, though, has been described as quite ornate The Hotel Pennsylvania was built to match Pennsylvania Station by the same architects. The trains run through part of the basement. The original lobby was a two-story \"Roman atrium.\" Shockingly, the hotel advertised it had a bathroom for every room instead of \"down the hall.\" There were no TVs or even radios in those days and rooms sizes reflected the lesser need for space. There is actually a Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society that is obviously dismayed by the turn of events.\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/savehotelpenn/ We are a couple trying to decide between these for an early October visit. We are interested in history, museums, Ellis/Liberty, just walking around, possibly catch a musical. We are not into shopping nor are we \"foodies\". I assume close access to the right subway lines is helpful, and probably a grocery/bodega; we\\'d rather not be eating out every meal or every night, hence the RI. We have Marriott points membership. TIA. Tough call. They’re each near some of the things you list and they’re all near good subway connections and all near decent food options. CP has some amazing views from what was and may still be the tallest hotel building in North America. Rooms are small but well designed. If you decide to stay there, try to get a corner room which is bigger and has more windows. It\\'s very convenient for most of the museums (walk or bus or subway) in the city and walking distance to theaters. This would be my pick because I’m a sucker for views and I think the location is ideal, but may not be yours.\\nWTC is near the ferry to the Statue a d there\\'s loads of history in the Fidi area being the oldest part of the city. It,s relatively new, as is the CP one but WTC has no real views.\\nThe TS one is actually across from Bryant Park and near but not in Times Square (a good thing). It,s the oldest of the 3 and I find the rooms somewhat drab, but it,s also walking distance to theaters and MOMA.\\nI think\\nOyster.com\\nhas photos of all 3.\\nEdited: 2:06 pm, September 01, 2021 I agree with Whiz.\\nOn one of my longish trips (over 10 days I think) I split my stay between the RI Central Park and the RI WTC. I stayed at RI CP first then moved down to RI WTC for the second half of my stay.\\nI liked them both for different reasons but my favourite was the RI CP. I was actually sad to be leaving that one. I loved the view (back then the Central Park view rooms were full on, no obstructions, but now a tall building is blocking the best view), the breakfast offerings were substantial, the room was really nice and had a lovely bathroom, the location and handiness to Hell\\'s Kitchen for eating, and Midtown and Central Park was excellent, several subway lines were nearby.\\nHowever, the RI WTC is usually cheaper, and it was for me.\\nThe RI WTC was also good in that the room was really big (bigger than my RI CP room), the location was good for all the downtown sights, the nearby Fulton St subway hub a few minutes walk was excellent, and I had a sliver of a view towards one of the 9/11 Memorial fountains. The breakfast room and offerings there wasn\\'t as good as the RI CP I thought.\\nLooking back I wished I would have stayed at the RI CP last to end the trip on a high (literally and figuratively), but you can\\'t go wrong with the RI WTC either. It\\'s just different. Planning a trip in 2022 for myself and daughter to visit New York. A surprise trip for her so I need to plan it with a youngster in mind.\\nHotels - Really looking for any tips on hotels, think mid town would be good but would consider anywhere.

Happy to go modern if not too wild!<<\\nMy tip for hotels - put your hotel choices on a map along with the sites and places that you’re thinking of visiting. This can give you an idea of what location is the most convenient.\\nYou can stay anywhere really and take the subway, buses or cabs to get to where you want to go. Some people might choose a hotel because it is a quiet location ,or a lively location. Other may want a location of a hotel that has lots of restaurants nearby for the evening.\\nFor most people the cost of the hotel narrows down your choices.\\nFun places for a 21-year-old : The East village is a great neighborhood for anyone but it has a lot of young people esp at night. The same for Greenwich Village , the west village & Chelsea/meatpacking district. Good point re surprise 👍. Looking to book April, 4 nights and looking for mid range hotel, nothing too fancy. Saw the Moxy online and this looked quite modern for her. Same with restaurants, definitely not posh or expensive. $200 per day budgeted for spending, to include trips but I\\'m happy to walk lots. Hotel budget depends but looking at $130-150 per night. Thank you, very useful 👍 Took my wife for her 50th bday for our 3rd NYC trip 4 weeks ago.\\nThis is a very detailed trip report as I simply copied my notes I took each day and lasted them here. So it’s long, but I know some of you enjoy step by step minutia, so hope you enjoy.\\nKeep in mind we aren’t art museum folks, we eat on the cheap side (no sit down dining anywhere fancy), and we tend to travel as frugally as possible, the exception being taking walking tours.\\nHere’s to NYC and subways that were no problem for us.\\nMonday - 6-14-21\\n-We landed at LaGuardia terminal B, bought two metro 7-day unlimited cards and purchased two bus tickets. Took the Q70 to Roosevelt, and E train to Spring St. walked 5 mins to hotel (Courtyard SoHo 181 Varick St) and found out we got free upgrade in celebration of wife’s 50th. (The only “headache”’with this was getting our luggage from bus to subway to hotel. Otherwise, I’d take this route every time to save $.)\\nUnpacked and walked up Varick (it turns into 7th St) straight to our favorite pizza joint so far-Bleecker Street Pizza. Both of us had a Nona Maria and another piece (should’ve stuck w 2 Nonas each-we we’re starving). We then took a short walk to Washington Square Park. Lots of folks hanging out, few skaters, handful of homeless, lots of marijuana smells wafting thru the air. (Marijuana was just legalized in NYC before we arrived, so it was everywhere.)\\nWalked to the 1 train uptown to 23rd St. to go to Gotham Comedy Club. We’re a bit early, so we found a bakery, “Big Booty Bakery Co” on 23rd & tried a cupcake & chocolate chip cookie-both were great. Made our way back to Gotham Comedy Club. It was new talent showcase night. $40 total for two tickets. They have a 2 drink minimum (alcohol or non-alcohol). We both had Diet Coke (no alcohol for us) and waited a few mins for the show to start. It was sold out and a nice venue (our first comedy club).\\nWe saw about 12-14 up and coming comics. Only 2 sort of tanked. The rest did really good in our opinion. Enjoyed our first comedy club experience. We took the 1 train at 23rd St downtown to Houston St. Walked back to hotel around 9:45. Put our things away and walked to CVS nearby to get our fix of Diet Dr. Pepper to put in the mini frig. The streets seemed deserted at 10:00, a bit creepily deserted, but then again we stayed closer to 34th st & Times Sq last time, so there were tons more people on the streets and it was precovid.\\nGot back to hotel at 10:15 and got ready for bed. Logged only about 5 miles this evening. More coming tomorrow with 2 tours.\\nSide note-love our upgrade to the top floor. Great view of ESB and midtown, esp at night.\\n————————————————————\\nTuesday - 6-15-21\\nWoke and walked down Spring St to Dominique Ansel bakery to try the famous cronut. Blueberry. Great. More crowded area at 8:30 am.\\nTook the C downtown to Chambers St. to meet our Patriot Tours Revolutionary Tour w Karen. Got there an hour early so we explored the area, walked around St. Paul’s Chapel, took some pics of One World Trade & Oculus. Needed a bagel, so a friendly Port Authority officer walked us outside and recommended Stage Door Deli & Pizza. This was a hopping busy place w several working class men grabbing breakfast to go. We were overwhelmed by all the choices and said if we were back down in the area we would try lunch or dinner. It all looked great-nonetheless we just got an everything bagel w regular cream cheese. Sat outside on the fence area around St. Paul’s and enjoyed a great bagel.\\nToured w Karen downtown area and learned about tons of facts w the American Revolution. The coolest of stories being how General George Washington was surrounded by the British army and navy. Through the middle of the night w the help of dozens of boats he was able to get his troops from Brooklyn Heights across to Manhattan thanks to the weather/storm, General Howe’s hesitance, and heavy fog the next morning. This saved Washington’s army and the war. It should’ve ended w this loss to the British.\\nOther notable sites were St. Paul’s Chapel (it was closed inside). Built in 1766 (before the Decl of Independence!) and has the original brownstone, windows, etc. Learned the importance of prominent printers of the revolution & how important they were to the colonists (John Holt & James Rivington). Learned about the long room in upper part of Fraunces Tavern where George Washington gave his farewell address to his commanders after the war.\\nFinished the tour and walked up to see Wall Street, Federal Hall, and Trinity Church from the outside (again, closed). Karen also told us how a huge chunk of Manhattan is owned by the church and just how wealthy it is.\\nWe got a fantastic authentic Italian sandwich at Pelinni Italian Panini. Walked back to hotel to rest our feet and enjoy the sandwich.\\nAt 2:00, Luke Miller, the owner of Real NY Tours, met us at our hotel to take a walking tour of the LES and East Village. We walked somewhere around 6-7 miles and covered Alphabet City and the dramatic change this area went through from Luke’s time there.\\nSome my fav stories & sites from Luke and our tour were:\\n-Levi Weeks trial (Hamilton & Burr we’re his lawyers & got him off) and the well still located in a clothing store basement where his wife’s body was found.\\n-Anderson Coopers current home\\n-brownstone where Mark Twain lived and one of the most haunted areas of NYC\\n-Cooper Union Building (w/ the rotating Alamo sculpture out front). Place where Abraham Lincoln gave a famous speech, then walked to McSorley’s Ale House to have a beer. Also heard the story the wishbones from WWI soldiers in McSorley’s who never made it back from the war.\\n-Eliza Hamilton’s brownstone after Alexander died. She sold the Grange to buy this home.\\n-Filmore East concert venue open from 68-71 w/all the big names of rock, folk, & blues.\\n-St. Mark’s Theater.\\n-Brownstone from the cover of a Led Zeppelin album.\\n-Ray’s Candy Store - open since 74-saved & supported by his community. Ray is from Iran-defected from there in 70’s.\\n-Charlie Parker’s home (great jazz musician)\\n-all the community gardens and how they sprang up b/c of the building being torn down. The residents planted their own green spaces and still take care of them today.\\n-Thompson’s Square Park and the riots in the late 80’s due to the homeless population and police\\n-Alphabet City-A-Alright, B-Bold, C-Crazy, D-Dead.\\n-tenements and immigration and the museum & the horrible conditions\\n-Chinatown market and area\\nHe dropped us off at Joe’s Shanghai Chinese food. We shared a sesame chicken plate and it was great! He recommended a foot massage place just down from Joe’s. They felt fantastic.\\nWalked down to the East Broadway Station to take F to Brooklyn to see BB Park at sunset. If you want a great view of southern Manhattan, you must visit here! We stayed and rested a bit and headed back to the hotel. Walked up the crossovers to Brooklyn Heights to Cadman Plaza High St Station and took the C back to Spring St. it was 9:45 and we were two worn out old folks.\\nWalked 14 miles today!\\n—————————————————————\\nWednesday - 6-16-21\\n-grabbed bagel & banana at corner store by hotel\\n-took the 1 train at Houston stop all the way up to 25th st. Had a 2-person mariachi band come on board w accordion and guitar. They were fantastic.\\n-exited the 1 train at 125th & Tiemann & walked to Grant’s Tomb to meet Helen w Big Apple Greeters\\n-Helen showed us all around Harlem and Washington Heights. Saw Grant’s Tomb, Riverside Church, the Cloisters (outside), Hudson River, then to Washington Heights to see the movie scenes of bodega, water hydrants, the park w George Washington Bridge view and basketball court. Then went down 125th St to see Apollo Theater. Finally, went down west side of Manhattan and upper West Side. She got us to our meeting point at 6th Ave & Waverly to start our food tour.\\nFood Tour - we met Lori w/ Free Tours by Foot at the Waverly Diner at 1:00 for our food tour of Greenwich Village. We had about 15 in our group and made a stop in Washington Sq Park first to get some history of the park & a few pics of the fountain and the arch.\\nFirst food stop was Artichoke Pizza and Mahmoun’s Falafel. Very surprised by both food samples. Artichoke pizza was very creamy and the falafel was deep fried and delicious esp w the hot sauce. Next we learned of the Cafe Wha, the Gaslight, and other coffee shops and bars where so many beatniks and musicians got their start. The Minetta Tavern where the burgers are now $36 and Reader’s Digest started in the basement. Next we tried Faiccios Pork Store and had their rice balls-creamy, cheesy deep fried deliciousness! Loved these. We forgot to go back here later and wished we had tried more - oh well there’s next time! Next was Bantam Bagles, mini bagels or pancakes w/ various creams inside. These were pretty good. Then we went to Bleecker Street Pizza to try our fav the Nona Maria. Fantastic as always. We ended our your at Molly’s Cupcakes. Very creative flavors here. I tried the Boston Creme. It was good, but should’ve gone w/ the blueberry cheesecake.\\nWalked 6-7 mins back to our hotel to rest our legs for the subway ride and walk to Circle Line Cruise. We rested about an hour and freshened up. Took the 1 train at Houston uptown to 42nd st Times Square. We walked down 42nd St west all the way to Pier 83 and got checked in and boarded only 10 mins later to the sunset cruise around southern Manhattan, up near SOL, then up the East River to Roosevelt Island, and turned around to go same way back. Great cruise w some cool facts by the narrator, and some fantastic photo ops. Would like to do a complete circle around Manhattan in the future.\\nCaught the M50 bus to save our feet. Rode it to 50th & Broadway. Walked up N on 7th Ave to 52nd St and got some Halal Guys food. Walked back thru Times Square to check out the night scene. Had a guy offer me cocaine in Times Square-that’s a first. (We both felt Times Square was more sketchy than any subway stop or ride or any place on our trip….just did not like TS.)\\nTook the 1 train from 43rd St back to Houston and walked back to hotel at 10:00.\\nWalked just over 8 miles today\\n—————————————————————-\\nThursday - 6-17-21\\nLeft hotel at 8:00 and grabbed breakfast at Baresha market across from hotel. Took the 1 train downtown to South Ferry to walk over to Castle Clinton to board our SOL and Ellis Island tour. Very few people on subway comlared to previous visits. We’ve only had to stand on a subway ride one time.\\nArrived at South Ferry stop on the 1 train and walked through Battery Park to Castle Clinton. Very nice park area, but lots of construction. We waited in the security line for about 30 mins (much like an airport but don’t take off your shoes). About a 12 min ride over to Liberty Island.\\nOnce we arrived, we walked straight to the foot of the SOL. There were hundreds taking photos, so of course we did too. Took several great pics on my Canon on the way over. We stayed for 10 mins to get pics, then walked to the museum (nice clean RR), gift shop (the usual, but didn’t buy anything), and then rushed to catch the ferry over to Ellis Island.\\nWe took the free audio tour of Ellis Island on 2nd level. Very interesting and desperate stories of so many coming to America. The Registry Room was quite impressive as the big hall where immigrants would first go through to be screened and questioned. We didn’t do the 3rd level due to time.\\nGot back to Battery Park and took the 5 at Bowling Green to Brooklyn Br stop and hopped over to the 6 to Astor Place. Walked down 2nd Ave to Paul’s Da Burger Joint for lunch.\\nIf you want a great burger while in NYC, head to Paul’s da Burger joint. Burgers & fries were great! It’s not too far from Ray’s Candy Store either. Walked back to the R train uptown to Times Square to look for some souvenirs. Found t shirts in Levi’s: Times Square is just crap. Wouldn’t recommend it. Stayed just a minute to get a drink and fruit smoothie and walked to the B train at 47th st north to American Museum of Natural History.\\nWife stayed on the steps of AMNH while I went for a couple of hours exploring the northern half of Central Park starting at 81st st. What a beautiful place. Walked around the Jackie O’Nassis Lake, found several waterfalls, two really nice ones in the Ravine. Walked in the North Woods, and out the northwestern part of the park at 110th st. Just under 3.5 mile hike & only wished I could’ve stopped a few times to take it all in.\\nHopped on the B downtown to get off at 81st st to meet back up w the wife. We decided to go back to hotel to rest. We decided we wanted to try a different halal food so we got back on the B train 50th/Rockefeller. Walked around to look for a couple more souvenirs. Got some halal at Adel’s Famous Halal at corner of 6th Ave & 50th St. and took the 1 back to hotel at 7:30 to crash for the night. We liked theirs even better than Halal Guys….and only $7 for chicken over rice (or over spicy rice!). It was GREAT-we thought we both could eat our own plate but could not-we should’ve shared one meal. It’s only $7 per plate & one of the best deals in NYC for good food! Get you some Adel’s Famous Halal!\\nPacked up our bags for quick exit in the morning.\\nLogged in just under 13 miles today!\\n———————————————————\\nFriday - 6/18\\n-took the 1 at Houston St uptown 2 stops to 14th. Walked west to the new Little Island park. Very cool little place that’s FREE and funded by private donations. Don’t need a ticket in morning til noon. Free timed tickets required after 12:00.\\nWalked over to Chelsea Market to check it out. Has the best set of bathrooms in NYC that I’ve found so far! Wanted to eat Los Tacos #1 but it was only 10:00 am, and they didn’t open til 11:00. Got a pastry at a pastry place instead.\\nWalked down 13th St to Union Square Park for the Farmers Market. Had tons of stuff there. Took the 6 train at Union Square to Bleecker St to Prince St Pizza. This place has great reviews and the spicy pepperoni was fantastic! We walked to Eileen’s Special Cheesecake to get a small strawberry cheesecake. Took it to hotel to enjoy and rest a few mins before getting to airport.\\nWe walked w all our bags to the Spring St station and took the E train uptown all the way to Jackson Hts/Roosevelt and got on the Q70 bus to LaGuardia.\\nThe flight home was great. We had a fantastic 3rd trip to celebrate her 50th. Times Square was our biggest disappointment (the overall vibe and people hanging out there). Other than TS, we loved every moment and every mile.\\nWe tried to stay as economical as possible. Our entire trip including airfare and hotel was $2800. My budget was 3000, so that made me a happy man.\\nIf you made it to the end, I applaud you patience and thanks for reading! Message me w any questions. Lovely Thanks for sharing Great report ! Glad to see you giving some tour guides income. Thank you! You really can see more with folks who know. Thank you for the great TR. My wife and I are going to NYC in February to celebrate her 50th. We have our nights figured out, she\\'s a big fan of musicals so already got tickets for Phantom and Wicked, but you gave me some great tips on tours to take during the day. thank you for the great trip report! Thanks for posting such a detailed report -- I love walking tours, too!\\nIf you do want to do an around-Manhattan cruise on your next NYC trip, look into the one on Classic Harbor Line, which is narrated by an AIA architect. I can see that you like to learn history and interesting tidbits, and I think the narration would be right up your alley!\\nGlad you enjoyed the trip -- a belated Happy 50th to your wife! Thanks for posting and such a lot of helpful advice. You really know how to pack in a lot of stuff. I think the Penelli Italian place you mentioned on Tuesday is Pisillo Italian Panini on Nassau Street? Just wanted to clarify in case anyone else wants to try it. Definitely good sandwiches (and very big) plus they have a pastry cafe next door. Come back soon! Great report, glad you enjoyed. Great report --- glad to see Manhattan is bustling again and that you were able to bustle along with it. I love your travel style. I think Varick Street becomes 7th Avenue, not 7th Street (just for people trying to figure out where you were.) You weren\\'t too far from one of my favorite bars -- the Ear Inn which is supposed to be one of the oldest bars in town. Great report\\nI do think the issue of Cost of Food is a little exaggerated here, One can eat in NY a lot cheaper than it appears from many of the posts. You can eat in NYC fairly cheap, I someone wish people understood this Wow! What a fabulous report! Thanks for including so much detail about the tours that you were on, and what you saw and learned. Often people ask \"is it worth it?\" and your report certainly makes the case for professional tours! And you certainly ate your way through Manhattan! Lots of great recommendation for people who are looking for very affordable eat-on-the-run options. I just loved this report! You not only covered so much, you have given so many people lots of great ideas. Hello - does anyone know if the parade will be impacted this year, I am sure its hard to tell now but is it currently scheduled to go as planned? We are booked at the Essex House but not sure if we should cancel our room - we can\\'t see the parade from the room we have booked so will need to get a spot outdoors - whats the best place to see how/if crowd will be managed or if there are any restrictions or changes to the event? Thinking we may plan for 2022 instead but wanted to ask. No way to know now. Columbus. Or Le is a god place to watch which is close to your hotel. Keep an eye out for Macy\\'s updated plans https://www.macys.com/social/parade/ Thank you! Its such a risk with canceling the hotel in time to not be charged - we are leaning towards canceling since my daughter will be with us. I\\'ll keep an eye out on the site you shared though. We dont know, but they just cancelled the West Indian Day parade which is one of the largest parade (Its supposed to take place Labor Day Weekend) .\\nIf you would ask my opinion, I would be on the Pessimistic Side Btw, I tried to write Columbus Circle as a good place to watch.😇. By when do you need to cancel?\\nEdited: 1:04 pm, September 01, 2021 We have tickets for two Broadway musicals that we had planned on seeing before everything shut down in 2020. Now we are going in October. Sad that some of our favorite places are closed and the tours are operating at reduced capacity or not at all.\\nOne thing we want to do that we\\'ve never done before is the Empire State Building. The regular ride up is $42 and there is an option for a 90 minute tour (limit of 7 people) for $162. Has anyone done this. I am on the fence since the price is almost three times more. Any feedback greatly appreciated. Not a chance I would shell out for that. Maybe if it was pre-pandemic and peak tourist season with the lines as long as possible and if I had limited time but I don\\'t think that is going to be the situation in October. Thank you red259. I think reality set in when I actually thought about the price! All the rooftop views are expensive\\nTop of the Rock which most agree is better than the Empire State Building is $38\\nthe Edge which is in Hudson Yards is $36\\none world trade center is $38 ,with discounts available I also would not spend that kind of money for an observatory. What I have spent additional money on is going to the 102nd floor at the Empire State Building. I thought it was worth it.\\nI don\\'t agree that one observatory is better than another. They\\'re all different and are enjoyable if your enjoy observatories. IMO Top of the Rock is better because you get to see the Empire State Building, you will get the perfect shot for it Unless you have a need to say that you have actually been inside the Empire State Building and unless you have the time to spare to go into the building, you should just go to Top of the Rock. ESB often has evening light shows playing on its facades in addition to its stationary lights, but you need to be a distance away to adequately see the light shows, not in or on the upper floors of ESB. TotR has an excellent, photogenic, direct line of sight to ESB, plus its admission fees are lower than those at ESB. I haven\\'t been to the Edge Observatory in Hudson Yards; it may also have a good view of ESB, though it would be higher up and more distant. ESB does have interesting exhibits about the building on its 2nd floor that you might like seeing. Here is the ESB website for its light shows:\\nhttps://www.esbnyc.com/about/tower-lights/calendar Not everyone is here , a few are missing\\nBut here is a photoblog of most of the river crossings of NYC Bridges, Some of them even locals might not even know so well\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/Nn5ne91\\n1.

Always jammed up. Im not sure if there is even a good spot to take a picture of this Bridge\\nEdited: 9:10 am, August 31, 2021 Also Not shown is the Broadway Bridge , which is the only Bridge from Manhattan to Manhattan, It goes from Inwood Manhattan (The upper tip of the Island ) to Marble Hill which looks to be in the Bronx, but is actually in Manhattan (The Land was changed when they redug the Harlem River and diverted it) and filled it in between Marble Hill and Mainland Bronx Eight NYC bridges held world records when built. The Brooklyn, Williamsburg, George Washington, and Verrazzano were the longest suspension type. The Bayonne was the longest steel arch. The section of the Triboro to the Bronx was the largest vertical lift. The Roosevelt Ave. Bridge (now stationary) in Flushing was the largest bascule bridge. Only the Hell Gate retains its title as the strongest major span in the world, capable of carrying four heavy trains at once.\\nA great curiosity is the Carol St. Bridge of Brooklyn that conveniently parks itself in a vacant lot when navigation needs to pass.\\nhttps://vimeo.com/24195648\\nThe High Bridge, originally an aqueduct, is very impressive with its stone arches. Too bad the ones in the water were replaced with a steel arch to allow easier passage for ships. Sharon Reier\\'s \"The Bridges of New York\" (1977) is a helpful guide to the subject.\\nEdited: 5:24 pm, August 31, 2021 Nice photos. Good to see the Sydney Harbour Bridge on there. :-) Actually the Sydney Harbor Bridge was a Copy of the Hellgate Bridge very nice pictures. Thanks for sharing. Yes, the earlier plan was for a suspension bridge for Sydney Harbour, but the Hell Gate changed the planners\\' minds. The Sydney bridge is somewhat larger ( 1,650 ft vs. 978 ft.) and is in a far more prominent location. The Hell Gate was pained only once since 1914 in a custom red color that quickly faded due to a defect in the pigment. I would like to see it in a bronze brown color myself. I was reminded you can actually see most of the Bridges posted here fairly easily. If you take the Circle Line tour around Manhattan, it passes all the Bridges posted here that go to Manhattan and a few I didnt post (Minor Bridges)\\nI did post a number that the Circle line does not pass especilly the Verazzano Bridge, but you can see the Verazzano and the Bayonne bridge from a distance from downtown Manhattan and from near the Statue of Liberty. The Marine Park Bridge can be seen if you take the NYC Ferry to Rockaway.\\nThe hardest ones for a tourist to see are the Throggs Neck, Whitestone, Goethels (not Posted) and the Outerbridge Crossing , the first 2 between Queens and the Bronx and the Last 2 between Staten Island and New Jersey. . There is a bus from Fushing Queens to the Bronx Zoo that goes across the Whitestone Bridge.\\nThe only way to see the Throggs Neck , Goethels and Outerbridge Crossing is by car. The Goethels is probably the hardest to photograph as its by a swamp and there doesnt appear to be a spot to photograph it Another steak place that will get asked about is opening its doors on the 8th September.\\nHawksmoor has been in London for many years and is one of the best, modern casual, steak restaurant.\\nMenu looks the same as the UK one, and prices are similar too ($50 for a 10oz fillet steak).\\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this place going forwards, based on eating at quite a few of the London sites...\\nreservations now open - https://www.hawksmoornyc.com/\\nM I had two nice meals at the bar at the Hawksmoor near Shoreditch High St. in 2019... Look forward to checking out their NYC location. Convenient location from the PATH too! Thanks M4R. Appreciate the notification of a new steakhouse. I loved the Hawksmoor in Seven Dials. I am sad that Sunday Roasts are not on the NYC menu. Thanks for the info, M4RKM. Looks good to me. Very excited to check this one. @3 - would Sunday Roasts go down well in NYC - they\\'re such a traditional British thing.\\nIt would either be an absolute flop, and no one would want one, or it\\'s such a unique offering, it would be booked months in advance and reservations impossible... (3 weeks for a decent timed table at Seven Dials right now, so they\\'re reasonably popular here in London).\\nThere are better Sunday roasts in London though..\\nM Is it difficult to get an uber from midtown to Newark airport on Christmas day?\\nReply Are you wedded to Uber? Many here would recommend a car service like Dial 7 or Carmel. Ride shares may increase their prices on a holidayl No. But when I take a cab or Uber on a day lien Christmas, I think about what it means for someone to give up their holiday to work, and I tip a LOT. Risa, you are assuming that the driver is a Christian. It’s a day off for everyone, regardless of religion- no school, most businesses closed. If they have a family, and they work, then they’re making a sacrifice. Howland has a point, there are plenty of people that do not celebrate Christmas, it\\'s just another day for them. Whatever. No one is seeking advice on tipping cabs and uber on Christmas day or it\\'s meaning in relation to work for various religions or lack thereof.\\nBut if you ask me any day of work is making a sacrifice unless you are one of the fortunate few doing something for money that you also enjoy. I\\'d tip more at Christmas simply because that\\'s what I do around Christmas though. But I\\'m sure anyone is capable of deciding for themselves what they do. Regardless of any individuals activities on the day - traditional observance or pure leisure - Christmas is one of the quietest days of the year\\nShowing consideration & appreciation for those who choose to provide services is a nice thing to do.\\nAgree with #1 you should consider booking a car service because you will know the cost in advance\\nUbers \"surge\" pricing can be unpredictable and pricey “I’d tip more at Christmas because that’s simply what I do around Christmas”.\\nUm yeah. That’s all I’m saying.\\n(Not my holiday and I truly couldn’t care less about the religious aspects). I totally agree with post #2 .\\nDecember 25 is a federal holiday. Not just another day.\\nEdited: 10:46 am, August 26, 2021 Christmas morning tends to be quiet, its much busier later in the day My husband and one of our adult children will be in NYC for two nights in early October (checking in Sunday the 3rd, checking out Tuesday the 5th). I was there in May and stayed at the Club Quarters near the Grand Central Terminal for a ridiculous $75/night + taxes (no resort fee), no doubt due to Covid. I stumbled upon that deal on Travelzoo. That location is currently $244+/night.\\nThere are a number of cities that I visit that consistently get less expensive in the week or two prior to travel, but I know that isn\\'t true everywhere (and I\\'m an NYC novice). I know it\\'s highly unlikely that I\\'ll ever stumble upon a rate like we had in May again, but does anyone have a sense about whether the prices are likely to drop or increase as our travel time nears?\\nJust trying to figure out how aggressively I should be trying to book NOW. I would be making a refundable and cancellable booking now at a price and hotel you\\'re happy with and then just monitor the situation over the next few weeks. If you find something else you prefer, you can cancel the first one with no penalty as long as it\\'s outside the cancellation window.\\nLook at all booking engines including TravelZoo and others such as booking.com and hotels.com. They often have sales that are cheaper than booking directly. Of course, compare the booking engine rate with the hotels\\' own website and take into account any extra resort fees or facility fees that are charged per night.\\nIn regards to whether October is an expensive month for hotels, Yes it is generally. Look at post #5 in this thread: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k9297802-Cheapest_Months_to_Most_Expensive_for_NYC_for_hotels-New_York_City_New_York.html And if you didn\\'t mind the Club Quarters at GCT, there is another one named \"Midtown - Times Square\" that looks a little cheaper. That\\'s on 45th St, not right in the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The location\\'s not bad. Recent reviews for that one are all very positive. We usually have seven or eight nyc reservations pending at all times. We rarely see prices drop less than a month out from travel except under extraordinary circumstances. Thanks for the insight! Very helpful!\\nWe tend to spend little time in our rooms on trips like this one will be. For R&R trips we like suites with separate bedrooms, etc., but this will just be a place to crash for sleep.\\nAfter posting last night I located a good rate for a double room at the Grand Central Hampton Inn. $290 for two nights, which includes taxes/fees, and there is no resort fee as far as I can tell. I have it reserved but will keep checking in case something better comes along. The rates may come down closer to the date if rooms are not sold. 2 beds generally cost more than 1. Covid is the wild card and makes it hard to predict. In \"normal times\", I would sometimes see rates drop 3+ months out but not usually 1-2 months. My only experience since covid was in July and the prices increased in the 4-6 weeks leading up to my dates. I always make a refundable booking (or two) and check rates periodically. If that $290 rate is inclusive for both nights and not just per night, you found a great deal for that time period. I\\'m not seeing anything even close to that bargain at the hotel website or looking at several 3rd party sites. Interesting...\\nMy Groupon Getaway deal is for a total of $290.90 for two nights. I just double-checked my confirmation email and it reflects the price I saw on the site when I booked last night.\\nSubtotal: $281.41\\nTax Recovery Charges and Service Fees: $9.49\\nTotal: $290.90\\nI suspect something was coded wrong and I wasn\\'t charged the taxes I should\\'ve been. Here\\'s the listing: https://www.groupon.com/deals/ga-bk-hampton-manhattan-grand-central?check_in=2021-10-03&check_out=2021-10-05&city_slug=new-york-city&destination_id=c4b538e8-4974-44c9-955f-21e4ac060239&destination_name=New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20USA&offset=0\\nI just tested booking the same room type as last night and it\\'s showing:\\nSubtotal$282.26\\nTaxes and Fees$58.31\\nOrder Total:$340.57 I was able to get great rates twice in April and early June due to Covid, but I think those rates are gone. I have a trip planned in early Oct and I’m not seeing those under $100 rates at good quality hotels anymore. Hi!\\nI’m doing 17 nts in the states next year (fingers crossed!) and spending 6 nts in New York. For my sins, I’m a Starbucks fan but I want to try to avoid it for the time I’m there and try different places instead. Any recommendations for the best iced coffee in In midtown and lower, and Brooklyn ? I’d like to try a different place every day. Thanks! There are a lot of coffee places all over now. A chain that has opened up a lot of outlets and is pretty good is Blue Spoon. Grumpy has a number of outlets but I find it a tad bitter. I like Joe Coffee in Grand Central.\\nOne place I noticed that I wanted to try was Dreamers Coffee House at 54 W Henry St - didn’t have their coffee as I was time pressed, but it looked good.\\nThere’s also a small chain called Ground Central that’s pretty good.\\nI’m not a big fan of Stumptown coffee but others like it.\\nTo me, Sant Ambroeus has the best coffee/espresso. The best. But I like Italian Roast best. So you’re going to have to experiment to see what your “best” is. My daughter would walk up to Juniors on 44TH from our hotel and pick me up coffee that was fanstastic. There is no \"best\" coffee in NY. There are countless coffee shops serving coffees from around the world. They are on like every other block in some neighborhoods. Starbucks is easily avoided in NYC. I would not spend valuable time in NYC (You said you had 6 days) just looking for Coffee. Most people could not tell the difference anyway between Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts or a fancier Coffee Bar If you like Starbucks then try Starbucks Reserve. I know you\\'re a man of the people, Howard, but not everyone agrees that you can\\'t tell the difference.\\nI was at Joe Coffee in Grand Central last week. I ordered a latte and they showed me two cups and asked what size. The smaller one was ridiculously small. I asked \"who would ever order that one?\" The two women went on and on about how people who really like good coffee order a small one, I agreed that was 100% true for an espresso or cortado, but not for a latte, and they agreed, in turn (and then a discussion of \"to foam or not to foam\" ensued. I am in the anti-foam category). I drink espresso for my first shot of the morning, a small one...then a latte an hour or two later. Oddly, when I\\'m visiting a friend or in a hotel with mediocre coffee, I notice I drink more, not less, unconsciously, because I keep looking for that good delicious taste and don\\'t feel satisfied. Dunkin Donuts is undrinkable - there are times when I have had no choice (there are no choices other than Dunkin Donuts in the state capitol - I think it should be number one on the new Governor\\'s agenda to fix that abomination ;) ) and then I end up throwing it out. (the only other time I buy Dunkin Donuts is when I have to fill my car on the Grand Central...I don\\'t know why I fall for it, but once every 2-3 years, I buy coffee at that gas station and end up pouring it out the window.\\nYes, there are people who can discern between good coffee, good wine, and good olive oil, and are willing to take the time (or spend the money) to get what they like, even - and most especially - on vacation. NYC doesn\\'t have a fabulous coffee culture like in great European cities, there are not a lot of places where you actually want to linger and watch the world go by (which is something I like to do on vacations). New Yorkers tend to like their coffee, especially ice coffee, in a big container, to go, and run off. If lingering over coffee is something you like to do, try Nello and Sant Ambroeus on Madison, mid afternoon, after lunch, before dinner rush (otherwise, they won\\'t seat you). There are also a couple of Sant Ambroeus gelato/coffee places around town. Alternatively, go to Bar Pisellino on the corner of Grove St and Seventh Ave for Cafe Freddo and watch a very different world go by.\\nEdited: 1:27 pm, August 30, 2021 \"Most people could not tell the difference anyway between Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts or a fancier Coffee Bar\" I certainly can tell the difference and I highly doubt I am one of only a few people that can. The plethora of coffee houses and different coffee beans sold in the stores really stands in contrast to this premise. There are tons of small, independent coffee shops around the city - I wouldn’t begin to hazard an opinion on which is “best,” although I do have favorites based on convenience, atmosphere & personal taste. Irving Farm is good, in my opinion, and has multiple locations.\\nYou mentioned Brooklyn as well as Manhattan…whereabouts are you going to be in Brooklyn? I might be able to offer some recommendations. There are many different ways to brew coffee & some have different preferences. I can remember a few years ago that there was a couple of threads about Australian coffee & just recently there was a thread on where to get German/Austrian coffee. Alas, I am not a coffee drinker so I can\\'t help with specific types of coffee but I\\'d suggest the OP do a search on the different types of coffee.\\nAs for not being able to tell the difference between similar items, many years ago either Coke or Pepsi had booths at the State Fair with a taste test between the 2 brandsw. Many folks said they couldn\\'t tell the difference but I can definitely say I picked Coke over Pepsi every time. Culinary folks call the phenomenon being a \"supertaster.\" \"I would not spend valuable time in NYC (You said you had 6 days) just looking for Coffee. Most people could not tell the difference anyway between Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts or a fancier Coffee Bar\"\\nFirst off no one said or implied they were going to spend 6 days \\'just\\' looking for coffee so while that may be sound advice to an imaginary poster it\\'s useless for this guy who specified an area and says he just wants one a day.\\nAnd had you said people are unable to tell the difference between Dunkin and skunk urine I\\'d be inclined to take your word for it but while taste is individual and perhaps that is your experience, you shouldn\\'t be commenting on behalf of most people because first you are wrong and second it\\'s irrelevant because the OP would no be asking this question if he could not tell the difference between various coffees.\\nEdited: 2:22 pm, August 30, 2021 Staying at the ludlow for a few nights.

At a press conference today, the White House press secretary said restrictions on entry to US from various countries will remain in effect. Didn\\'t suggest when they might end, just said for now, mostly due to widespread transmission of Delta variant, nothing will change. Not unexpected given the situation over here. Tough on those separated from family and loved ones but for those planning vacation trips etc it was always the most likely outcome this year. I booked a March 2022 trip some time ago (all cancellable) with the thought that if things aren’t better by then, we’ve got bigger problems than whether we get to go on vacation! I am very confused with the logic behind this. It’s not very confusing, nothing has changed. Things are not getting any better here in the U.S. or elsewhere with different covid variants and increased cases in those unvaccinated and vaccinated as well. Where most were hoping for some restrictions to be lifted it looks like it may be a bit longer, who knows what the fall will bring or when kids begin returning to school or college. It will be ever changing travel during a pandemic, for now things remain the same.\\nHope for the best, encourage people to get vaccinated, wear a mask and let’s move forward, not backwards!\\n🤞💉😷 JNSgraphic\\nWhat I don\\'t understand is what criteria is used to decide which countries are banned from travel and which aren\\'t. People from Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Turkey, Russia, Japan and Indonesia are not prohibited from travelling to the USA, some of which have very high covid rates and very low vaccination rates. #4 - FWIW the current policy was adopted in the previous administration\\nWhile I agree the current policy has nonsensical aspects I don\\'t know (and will not comment on) on what basis those decisions were likely made.\\nI certainly hope the current administration is reviewing the policies and may come up with something that seems more fact based.\\nConsidering our domestic current issues with vaccine uptake and the spread of virus variants I have no idea what they could decide that would make everybody happy\\nEdited: 9:40 am, July 27, 2021 Kaye\\nThank you for your reply.\\nI can understand why the travel bans were initially introduced - they followed the spread of the virus - China - Europe - UK etc. Now the virus is everywhere, it would seem more logical to base the decisions on some kind of science. Or, given the emphasis that is being put on vaccinations by President Biden and Dr Fauci. Allow fully vaccinated and tested individuals to enter.\\nWhatever is decided, I just want to understand the thinking behind it\\nEdited: 9:46 am, July 27, 2021 Mcmullan, currently the US border is closed to non-essential travel from Canada into the US. Canada is opening her borders shortly to Americans. Don\\'t hold your breath waiting for Vaccine Passports to be a thing in the US. That\\'s unlikely to ever fly here. Vini_B_53\\nThat\\'s the land border, you can still fly. Hank W\\nI agree, but it would be easy to make it a condition of entry for foreign visitors. Rates not a factor, which would you choose?\\nLocation and room quality are important.\\nThank you I don\\'t know about room quality, but I might prefer location of Meridien, if that is one on W 57th.\\nI don\\'t know about Meridien but Westin only reopened short while ago and may not have everything running yet. You should check to find out if services important to you -- gyms etc -- are operational, at both hotels. Westin in police precinct, east midtown, where there have been a lot of random mostly petty crime issues, and quality of life issues, and police not too responsive. Don\\'t know if police response any better in west side.\\nEdited: 3:08 pm, August 31, 2021 If the Meridien is the former Parker Meridien there used to be lots of bad customer service reports over at Flyertalk. I\\'d look at recent reviews. We stayed there a few times and liked the pool and Burger Bar. Not sure if they are still extant I\\'ve stayed at the Westin Grand Central and it\\'s good.\\nThe Meridien is not the old Parker Meridien and the old Parker Meridien did not get bad reviews (I stayed there a few times and it was fine). The current Meridien Central Park has consistently gotten bad reviews and I would not choose to stay there. The location of Le Meridien Central Park is what most would prefer but the hotel is in bad repair and service is an issue. So I wouldn’t,t stay there. The Westin is fine but less interesting area although convenient for getting around. It,s more a business hotel. Truthfully, neither would be my choice but I wouldn’t,t mind the Westin. I recall complaints about the Parker charging for drinking glasses and broken fixtures in the rooms. As I said, we enjoyed it on our three or four stays there, On September 11th 2021 it will be 20 years since NYC was attacked and the world changed forever.\\nThere are a few special commemorations and programs being held this year in memory of the lives lost. There are many ways to pay your respects if you can.\\n- Family Commemoration at the 9/11 Memorial (free tickets required for family members): https://911memorial.org/connect/commemoration/20th-anniversary-commemoration\\n- Citywide Commemoration (musical performances, museums, gardens, cultural institutions): https://911memorial.org/20th-anniversary/september-11-2001-commemoration/20th-anniversary-citywide-commemoration\\n- View the Tribute in Light: https://911memorial.org/visit/memorial/tribute-light\\n- Plan your own observance: https://911memorial.org/plan-your-own-911-anniversary-observance\\n- The Tribute Wall: https://neverforget.org/remember/ The Guides Association of New York is sponsoring many live and virtual (you can come even if you aren\\'t here) tours commemorating the 20th anniversary of September 11th.

Repeatedly I have seen at JFK that baggage collection takes at least an hour esp at terminal 4. You need to wait for very long for the bags to start coming on the baggage collection station and then one bag comes at a time. It seems that only one or two very lazy persons are handling the bags. At other airports, in many countries, all bags are out on the collection belt in 20-25 min, some of these airports are very big and handling many flights at a time. Bad, perhaps.

Apparently a private car through Airlink would cost $198!\\nShe doesn\\'t know NYC at all and is really stressed so I\\'m wondering if anyone can help with a less expensive way to get there that doesn\\'t involve multiple changes (fingers crossed)?\\nThank you! Uber says around $90 for that trip.\\nAnother option if you\\'re ok with a single transfer (all you said was not multiple transfers) would be a $52 Cab(flat rate) to Harlem-125st station in Manhattan, then metro north up to New Rochelle or Mt Vernon. Also, if you were to do that trip directly by NYC cab, it would be about $60 from JFK to the Westchester/NYC border ($55 based on the Metered fare and then the other 5 dollars are just based on what traffic may be, but are subject to change) and then from there to the destination, the cost would be the metered fare ($2.50/mile or 0.50/min , whichever is more) multiplied by 2, which is the out of city surcharge. NYC cabs do accept these trips though, and it would likely still be cheaper than the airlink shuttle. Airlink is not a good option. Uber could be ok. This service, 1st choice taxi gets good reviews on Yelp\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/1st-choice-taxi-new-rochelle?hrid=Ct06H790zibgbn2a55rSjA&osq=Airport+Car+Service That link isn,t working.

(Early Sunday AM?)\\nCan she wrangle her luggage on public transport?\\nIs her destination near a Metro North station?\\nI\\'d comparison price NYC car services such as Dial 7 or Carmel There is something called NYC Airporter Bus , It costs $13 from JFK to Grand Central Terminal\\nTake that and at grand central take a Metro North train to New Rochelle I\\'m not certain the Airporter shuttle bus is running right now, and if it is whether it would be running at her arrival time, as they drastically cut back their schedule a couple yrs ago. Check their website.\\nI agree the yellow cab fixed rate to GCT or 125 St, then Metro North, is a good idea. With tip, toll and special fees taxi should come to about $75. Note the New Rochelle station is on New Haven line. I believe there are a couple stations in Mt Vernon. Mt Vernon East would be on New Haven line. MT Vernon West on Harlem line. There is another stop in Mt Vernon on Harlem line called Fleetwood. Bronxville ,on Harlem line just after Fleetwood, is also near both New Rochelle and Mt Vernon, and may be the station most likely to have taxis readily available, if that is a concern. It would probably be a good idea if she could take a closer look at exactly where she is going to figure out which station(s) would be best.\\nEdited: 6:00 pm, August 28, 2021 If she does take a train from Manhattan and is concerned about getting on right one, she might feel more comfortable leaving from Grand Central than 125 St. \"She doesn\\'t know NYC at all and is really stressed\"\\nShe might be traveling alone\\nShe\\'s traveling with \"a lot of unwieldy luggage\"\\nShe is taking a red eye and unlikely to be well rested when she arrives\\nShe is headed to a unclear destination - which might not be convenient to a train station\\nIMO these are not circumstances in which she should attempt public transit Hi, We plan to spend a day or two in and around TS, Rockerfeller, TOTR, Lego store, central park.

I am going to be in NYC for the next 3 days, both Wednesday and Thursday show heavy rainfall due to Ida, any suggestions on how I can enjoy my time in the city? I had not planned much originally and was going to wing it but the rain has me stumped now. I do plan on going to one museum (natural history museum) and spending some time at the New York library. Metropolitan Museum of Art, if you like that sort of thing. We had 3 solid days of rain on our last 4 day trip pre-pandemic. It was a first visit for some of our family so we just powered through our must-dos in the rain. I even bought some of my people disposable ponchos when their rain jackets couldn\\'t keep up with the rain. I usually try not to look like a tourist but the ponchos were simply needed.\\nWe enjoyed the Central Park Zoo in the rain- had the place to ourselves. Ditto Central Park.\\nWe even did Top of the Rock. Did it at sunset so still got to enjoy the lights.\\nOther things we did:\\nMet, NBC Studios Tour, Highline, Chellsea Market, NY Public Library, Grand Central Station\\nThe museums were so, so crowded, Buy your tickets ahead of time!\\nPack multiple pairs of shoes or rain boots. That was the downfall of one of my kids. They only had 1 pair of sopping wet shoes to rewear each day,. We filled them with newspapers over night and it helped but a 2nd pair+ of shoes would have been great. I agree that in these days of reduced capacity and advance bookings if you plan to visit a museum on a rainy day you need to book a slot ahead of time, and preferably not on the day of the visit. I recently visited the Met and chose a day between two days when rain was predicted. Also note the Met is now closed 2 days a week -- I believe it is currently Tues and Weds. Great suggestions of buying tickets beforehand Ill make sure to look into it right away! Guess it will depend on the amount of rain, maybe if its not too crazy Ill just grab a cover and head out. I was in New York for Henri which was a day of rain that I wasn\\'t even supposed to be in New York for (flight cancelled). I still walked outside but did go take a look at the Oculus and Brookfield place and figured out (after a while) that you can go between the 2 buildings without going outside.\\nAs I was not supposed to be in New York, I got a few suggestions on how to pass the time other than spend it in my hotel room: Besides shopping there was the Staten Island Ferry and Whitney Museum.\\nI would suggest wearing flipflops, I soaked both my pairs of shoes in one day. Be aware this is not normal rain, this is supposed to be 4-5 inches of rain and with the ground already soaked from Henri, The Subway might get flooded, Id try to stick to museums near your hotel Some of the food halls are pretty cool - Essex Marker or Chelsea Market. Also the Obama portraits are at the Brooklyn museum now. Pick a few museums each day and in between have lunch at a nearby cafe or diner to fill in some time. These are good for people watching and you could strike up a conversation with others.\\nThe stretch of 5th Ave all along Central Park is known as Museum Mile. There are so many museums here, some big and some small. https://www.ny.com/museums/mile.html\\nAnd because it\\'s right at central Park, you could have a wander in the park if the weather is not so bad.\\nShopping is good if you like shopping. Even just browsing in the stores can kill some time.\\nIf the rain is excessively heavy, the subway and other transport such as buses and taxi\\'s might be overwhelmed so be prepared for delays. You’ve been given great advice on footwear…even if you’re just going a short distance, heavy rains can turn intersections into raging rivers that you have to ford. This is an instance of “do as I say, not as I do,” but rain boots are a very good idea. Wear flip flops only if you have a strong stomach & well-developed capacity to not think about unpleasant things (like what’s in that water you’re wading in). Keep in mind that a flash flood watch has been issued for our area from 2pm Weds through 2pm Thurs. Three to four inches of rain are predicted, with the possibility of locally heavier amounts. In town for 3 days over a weekend. Couple weeks down the line. Just me and my wife. Late 40’s but still enjoy sitting in bar/cafe and people watching along the street.\\nHaven’t been to the City in maybe 7-8 years. Outdoor terrace bars I enjoyed years ago included the Village’s White Horse and Zum Schneider (when it used to be in East Village). Also have stayed in Williamsburg a few years back and enjoyed though j don’t recall a lot of street side terrace set ups.\\nJust really trying to find a street or collection of streets where we can walk less than 10 minutes and have a fine selection of outdoor preferably street side (or if not, City-view) drinking options for a boozy afternoon or two. We are more beer/wine/shots types than cocktails, if it matters. Coffee shops and solid food in the AM…short walk\\nIf Manhattan, looking to be staying between Chelsea down to Soho and over to LES. So let’s say 20th down through Houston and down around Broome. I know things change there…so just checking\\nBrooklyn maybe too. Williamsburg is ok; have stayed there before with friends. Or Cobble Hill/Gowanus. But we are open to other options\\nAny help appreciated. Cheers ! The time out Cafe in Brooklyn Bridge Park Cornelia Street and in and around there in the Village. One big party.\\nAlso the South Street Seaport and Pier 17. I think you’ll find that with the explosion of outdoor dining options, many streets/areas will give you what you’re looking for.\\nSince you’re here on a weekend, do try to experience one (or more) of our “open streets.” Vanderbilt Av in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, is especially festive, with great people-watching (closest subway is 2/3 to Grand Army Plaza). Same goes for much of Fifth Av in Park Slope. I’m less familiar with the scene in Williamsburg, but I’m guessing it’s similar. Seconding Vanderbilt Ave and 5th Ave in Brooklyn, those are the two areas I was going to suggest as well. There has been an explosion of outdoor dining. One of the few pluses from the pandemic. Basically any restaurant row in any residential area will have choices. Soho, Chelsea, the Village, almost everywhere you look now. Thanks all! Yes, I didn’t consider the side effect of COVID moving things to the street in spots. Keep em coming Please. Love to hear about your favorites…\\nEdited: 12:59 pm, August 31, 2021 I\\'m visiting NYC for the first time ever next week.

I plan on visiting The Rock, One World Trade Center and The Edge, but I would like to leave myself flexibility on when to visit each.\\n3) What is the best spot to get a pic of the New York skyline? And what is the best way to get a close up shot of the Statue of Liberty without actually visiting Liberty Island? I heard visiting the statue isn\\'t really worth it, but maybe I am wrong.\\n4) Any subway tips? Any subway lines or stations I should avoid? I plan on buying a 7-day Metro card and I\\'m likely going to be using it quite a bit. I\\'m flying into JFK and my hotel is in Midtown. I also plan on attending the US Open, Yankee Stadium and Citi Field.\\n5) Finally, best pizza places to buy a cheap slice? I would love to know where to go to get a quick bite during the day. Best Places for Lower Manhattan NYC Skyline are Staten Island Ferry, Govenors island and Liberty State park in NJ.\\nBrooklyn Brdige park gives you great views of the Skyline and the Brooklyn Bridge\\nGantry State park in Queens Gives you great views of Midtown Skyline (Chrysler Building, Empire State) and the QueensBoro Bridge\\nCheap pizza is everywhere. the $1 slices are a bit controvesial around here as they arent as good as normal pizza, but they should satisfy.\\nI don\\'t think reservations will be needed, tourism is a little light now because there arent any international tourists\\nI cant say for sure, but I would think a camera photo of you vax card should suffice A paid river cruise or ferry gives great skyline views as well.\\nTry different slices and decide for yourself. In my opinion, there is a reason why the dollar slices are that cheap. Try one or two, but then try other slice joints as well. If you can, give Joe\\'s a try, plenty of locations throughout the city, but the Carmine Street location is iconic. One of the best slices in the city in my opinion. Vaccination Proof for Indoor Activities: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page\\nBe mindful of your phone battery - one local reported having a visitor turned away from a venue when their phone died\\nEdited: 5:26 pm, August 30, 2021 Arguably most pizza is cheap: around $2.75/slice. Sure, try a $1.00 slice if you see one. But ask yourself if a $2.75 slice is breaking the bank. Would love to have you report back on your thoughts on that. There are good pizza places everywhere. Joe’s is one of the top recommendations. There’s one near my home. But the one on Carmine St is noticeably better.\\nA photo of your vax card is pretty much accepted everywhere, but they often ask for photo ID too, and want an original for that. I can’t quite explain that but that’s how it is.\\nThousands and thousands and thousands of people have been paying for the trip to the Statue of Liberty for generations. It may not be worth it to YOU. But for the many who do it, it’s worth it. That’s a decision only you can make. The 9/11 Museum says on the website it requires you book a timed ticket in advance.\\nhttps://www.911memorial.org/visit/museum\\nWhile you may be able to get in if you just walk up, you may have ta wait. Same with the observatories. If they,re not that busy, you may be able to walk right in. If you’re expecting to go to any of the observatories for sunset, I\\'d book in advance even if it,s same day.\\nThe “worth it” question is,personal and subjective. There\\'s a museum on Liberty Island and the same ticket to visit the statue also allows you to visit Ellis Island. You don\\'t list where you live so impossible to know whether the immigrant experience is relevant/personal to you. The ticket doesn\\'t cost much so the “worth it” is really about time.. Many people have raved about the Hard Hat tour which is separate and gives you access to the hospital on Ellis Island..\\nThere is no one best spot for a skyline view, but in general, the best views are not on Manhattan by looking back on it whether from Brooklyn, Queens, New Jersey or in a boat.\\nSubway tips\\nOn the right column of this page is the faq titled “top questions about nyc.” The 10th bullet down is how do I ride the subway. There are 3 links in there with different guides. Read at least one of them. The apps people like for directions are google maps, citymapper and the MTA trip planner. Everyone has their favorite.\\nEdited: 6:14 pm, August 30, 2021 1) I am from Canada and was asked for my vaccination status once. I showed my copy of the document on my phone and it was fine. I saw one location asking for a photo ID to match the document.\\n2) My favorite is Top of the Rock (ToTR) as during the day you can see Central Park and the Empire State Building. As for museums, I visited recently I booked my timed ticket 2 days in advance.\\n3) The best view I ever got of the Statue of Liberty was the Sunset Cruise offered by Circle Line.\\n4) I use the MyMTA app on my phone for the subway\\n5) My favorite pizza place was in Midtown and closed, but I had a slice at Little Italy Pizza downtown during my last trip and it was delicious. In Midtown there are many places on 8th Avenue, the only one I never liked was Amadeus. You are going to have so much fun! Are you solo?\\nI always loved the view of the skyline from over in Brooklyn. Governors Island too. You can see the statue pretty well from there as well, not up close but well. Top of the Rock is nice too because you see Central Park and look over the city.\\nThe subway guide in the sidebar is very good. It was made by what use to be a regular poster here. If you rather watch a video there is a girl under the name Urban Caffeine on YouTube that I enjoy watching. She has a clear, concise way of speaking that I enjoy. Disclaimer-I haven\\'t personally watched her subway one.\\nI cannot comment on Pizza, it has been too long for me but I too will be there in a few weeks and eating up all kinds of pizza. I\\'m also buying all my museum tickets before I come. It is more scheduled than I normally travel but we are not in normal times.\\nHave fun! Get ready to want to come back! Governor\\'s Island is good for a view of the SOL.\\nThe free Staten Island ferry gives you a view of the statue at a distance as you sail by. It doesn\\'t stop but plies the waters between Staten island and Manhattan. It\\'s a popular way to see the statue without actually going there. Allow an hour for the round trip.\\nAnother option for viewing from the water is the new NYC ferry that goes from Midtown (39th St) down to Staten Island via Vesey St. It\\'s $2.75 per ride. This is a new ferry route that started last week and looks like it might sail closer than the free ferry. It doesn\\'t stop at the SOL, just sails by.\\nhttps://ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/st-george/ Everyone has Bucket List items, NYC for many is a Bucket list trip and some sites are bucket list places to visit\\nIf The Statue of Liberty is a bucket list place, or a dream place to visit, then by all means you should go . I think the ferry tickets are $18 This is the view of the Statue of Liberty from Brooklyn Bridge Park , with a 20x Zoom on my Camera\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPLDfnqtSig/ My best friend and I are traveling to Manhattan in September for 4 nights to visit friends who live on the UWS (West 60s), Gramercy area, and then in Brooklyn Heights. I think staying somewhere in the 50s on the West Side is probably the best home base for us, as we\\'d be close to central park and can take the subway to our other two neighborhoods we want to visit.\\nA few questions\\n- traveling with two toddlers, do you agree that 1 hotel is better than trying to move to a 2nd hotel for part of the trip?\\n- traveling with two toddlers, it would be nice for me and my friend to be able to sit and talk once they go to bed. The two hotels I\\'ve found in our price range which would facilitate this are the Warwick (suite with one room with two double beds and then a sitting room) and Radio City Apartments (same sort of suite). The Warwick has some poor reviews recently and Radio City Apartments just seems a bit dated as well. Does anyone know of other hotels for up to $400 a night where we could have a similar set up?\\n- Alternatively, do you know of hotels where we could get two adjoining rooms for a similar set up? This seems hard to search for. Or else a room with two beds but then a balcony we could sit on?\\n- Or any other suggestions for hotel set up with two moms and two toddlers? We can each share a bed with our tot.\\nThanks so much! **- traveling with two toddlers, do you agree that 1 hotel is better than trying to move to a 2nd hotel for part of the trip?**\\nYes.\\nNo need to change hotels especially on such a short trip. Beaconhotel.com\\non the UWS in the 70’s is all suites. You\\'ll have to check price. Arthouse in the same area I think may have some suites.\\nAKA Central Park has suites but may be over budget.\\nThere are some suite hotels in the east 50’s\\nAffinia 50\\nSan Carlos\\nKimberly\\nI would PHONE the Warwick and find out if you can get connecting rooms. They also have some suites. I have been to NYC quite a few times in the last few years. We always stay at Radio City Apts.--- or Hotel Wolcott--that is currently shut down til further notice. The Radio City suits our needs, is in a great price range for one or two bedroom suites. It may be dated but it is clean and a great location. The only negative I\\'ve ever had with them --- the hotel clerks in the lobby are not friendly! LOL Guess that is my Southern manners coming out? I’d stay on the upper west side, you get just hop on the subway to get to Brooklyn. Your kids will love the playgrounds in Central Park as well riverside. We recently stayed in a suite at The Warwick and loved it. Great central location close to several subway lines. Spacious suite with classy, traditional decor. Marble baths are compact, but well-equipped with good counter space for toiletries. Also impressive, and focused hospitality from the staff. If you do opt for The Warwick, be sure to join the Warwick loyalty program, Warwick Journeys, before booking . It\\'s quick, free and easy to join online. You will get a reduced rate and the daily (tax included) $33 resort fee will be waived which will offer considerable savings. If you book through a 3rd party site you will not get this discount. Thank you all so much for the feedback. I\\'m really glad to hear the Warwick get a positive recent review. It is sounding like the perfect location for us. Will keep the other places in mind as well as backups. Thanks all! I have booked a transport cab from JFK to our hotel upon our arrival via booking.com. The cab company is called \"snagaride\". Does anyone have any experience with this company? Cause when I do a simple google search I cannot find much about it. Neither on tripadvisor.\\nReply Never heard of it. Did you book it because it was “free” included when you booked with booking.com?\\nI’m a cautious person I wouldn\\'t trust it , unless you hear from some travelers who can vouch. If it was me - I\\'d steer clear of a company you can\\'t find with a google search.\\nIf you really want to try it >> Why not do a \"test\" >> Call whatever contact number they gave you - and see if you can get a customer service agent within a reasonable time:\\n- If you can - ask them some questions about the service...\\n- If you can\\'t - imagine how that would feel after a long flight when you can\\'t find your driver...\\nAs answered in your other thread - I\\'d highly recommend a tried and true company (e.g., Dial 7 or Carmel), or a Yellow Cab from the Airport Taxi Queue, or mass transit.\\nGood luck! We already gave you advice in the other thread. No one knows this company, doesn’t sound like a good plan to me You\\'ve opened 3 threads on the same subject. What is it about the answers you\\'ve already gotten do you not understand? I see no valid reason to get cross with the OP , if you don’t like the question then skip it.\\nPerhaps they’re hoping someone will come along on this forum who has heard of this company.\\nThey were advised to post here on their other thread from New York State.\\nPS I’m sorry, I’ve never heard of it it either.

Why am I the only one who gets dinged for pointing it out? Sorry, but you will get the same answers that you received in your other thread.\\nThe majority of the locals/frequent visitors on Tripadvisor see no need to use a 3rd party to arrange transport from JFK into the city. They simply take a cab, Uber type service, known car service or public transport. Hi, our hotel checkin is at 4pm in TS and we would like to go to TOTR at 5pm. I am planning to buy tickets in advance but my concern is if we get late by 30/40mins for whatever reason and it is sunset time, do we still get to enter or do we have to pay extra fee for it? Any attraction where you have to be at a given place at a certain time on your arrival day is tricky if you\\'re flying in. You never know when you will run into flight delays. I think they have a leeway, not sure how long though. If you\\'re 10-15 min late you might be fine but if you\\'re half an hour or more they may make you wait until there\\'s a lull in visitors before letting you up. I don\\'t think they\\'d make you pay extra, but you should contact them to confirm.\\nSunset time is a very popular time, when is your visit? If it\\'s a few months away then 5.00pm will coincide with sunset and it will be busy. You might have less luck going up on arrival if you\\'re late.\\nIf you haven\\'t already bought tickets then I\\'d buy tickets for a later time, say around 5.30pm - 6.00pm.\\nAnd when you\\'re checking in and running late, just drop your bags at the hotel and check in when you get back from TOTR. The hotel will hold your bags if you explain the situation.\\nNote you will need to get from the hotel to TOTR and if it involves the subway allow extra time. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

What is the best way to get to the airport given the holiday and traffic. Thank you in advance! If you can provide a more specific location I’m sure the locals can help out.\\nHow many people? How much luggage? Kids? Adults? 1 adult, one teen. 1 suitcase each and a backpack. Leaving from 444 10th Avenue.\\nEdited: 9:14 pm, August 29, 2021 I\\'d just take the subway, but I\\'m cheap and would rather not spend money on a cab. With one suitcase/backpack each, subway should be doable. \"Best\" way has different meanings to different people. If the suitcase is bigger than a carryon, I would take a cab or car service - even if your luggage has great wheels, you have a fair amount of schlep-factor to consider, and escalators are not always working or available. If it\\'s a carry on, or you\\'re strong, then the subway/LIRR. If you are looking for the cheapest option, you can take the subway to the Air Train, for a little more, you can LIRR to the Air Train. You can get the subway and the LIRR at Penn Station, it\\'s a ten minute walk - but will probably take longer with a suitcase. All of the details are in the first question under Top Questions on the right hand side of this page (visible on a PC or laptop, not on your phone). There\\'s a bit of schlepping with walking through the streets with a suitcase, and changing trains, rather than a cab to your terminal. But that\\'s your call. If I were making that trip I would just hail a yellow cab. I agree with simply taking a cab. If that\\'s where you’re staying and you’re not with friends or family, it sounds like you\\'re renting what is likely an illegal vacation rental. For your trip to JFK, you’ll be on the extreme west side of Manhattan and JFK is east of Manhattan so you have to cross the entire width of the island, usually a long slow slog. The good news is the fare to/from JFK Nd Manhattan is a fixed price so however long it takes, the price will be the same...about $75 with tip and toll. If you want to be driven, I’d order a car service like\\nDial7.com\\nCarmellimo.com\\nso you don\\'t have to worry about finding a cab when you need it. Those services charge about the same as a taxi. If you\\'re budget conscious take the subway to the Airtrain. Google maps will give you all your options. The address is for a hotel. Four Points by Sheraton Manhattan Midtown West. So sorry, Jennifer. I misread it as 440 10th Ave. do you have the info you need? Hi,\\nA newbie to New York so I apologise!\\nCould anyone help me with getting from JFK to 51st street east /570 Lexington Avenue on Christmas Day please?\\n3 adults, 1 child. 2 suitcases and 2 pieces of hand luggage.\\nOpen to taxi/public transport!\\nThank you 😊 As a solo traveller, I would take the Air Train, then the E to the Lexington Ave station just around the corner (it has an elevator). You don\\'t say how old the child is, but for your party it may be worth simply taking a taxi. Thank you. The child is 11.\\nI googled cab costs and it looked around $70 plus tip but I don’t know if that’s the same for Christmas Day.\\nDo you know a rough estimate for public transport please?\\nThank you Cab fare is fixed (~$70 includes tip), Christmas Day makes no difference. Air Train is $7.75 per person, then subway fare of $2.75 per person (unless you get each person an unlimited card). For the difference in cost, a taxi is probably worth it for your group.\\nEdited: 6:11 am, August 30, 2021 Thank you, that’s very helpful. 😊 There is no extra cost for the Subway or a regular taxi on Christmas day\\nIf you take an UBER there might be a premium charge Take a taxi would be my advice. Agree Taxi will work. No extra charge on December 25th in fact the$ 4.50 rush-hour charge 4 - 8 pm weekdays is not in effect because it’s a federal holiday.\\nNo extra charges for luggage either ever.\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page\\nEdited: 10:11 am, August 30, 2021 Just make certain you use the official dispatcher at the curb & not someone soliciting rides which is usually a ripoff. Thank you- sorry for stupid question, but how do I make sure I am getting an official cab please? Follow signs in the terminal to \"Ground Transportation/Taxis\". When you get outside, there will be a kiosk with an attendant. There are usually lines. The attendant keeps the line moving and tells you which cab to get into. That person also hands you a yellow paper with your rights as a passenger. It\\'s quite easy to figure out that it\\'s the real line. Anyone who walks up to you and offers a ride, at any airport in the world, should not be trusted. Even if they don\\'t scam you the fare, they are probably breaking a few laws. (I\\'ve done it in a few countries and I\\'ve been mostly lucky...but that was at a gentler, simpler time...now these guys are all just crooks). Go to the official line, always. Hi all - I have a group of 8 visiting for 3 days and everyone has already been to NYC at least once so we can skip the touristy stuff. What are the newer must-do\\'s?

Green-Wood Cemetery?\\nAs others have said - knowing more about your interests, what you’ve seen & done on other visits, and what you most enjoyed will help us help you. My daughter and I are coming in on Friday night 9/10 and leaving Monday night. We have reservations at The Lexington - which seems like a fine location for us. We love to walk and take the subway. I know it\\'s the 9/11 weekend and since we\\'ve been to the memorials a few times- we won\\'t venture down this time. We usually have lots of plans made but this time I think we will \"wing it\"!! Any ideas are greatly appreciated- we haven\\'t been in two years- we\\'ve done most tourist things already. Oh- there\\'s a wedding coming up so shopping for a MOB dress is on a short list!! Ideas? Do you like museums? Cultural activities? Sports? It’s really hard to just guess what you may like.\\nAs far as shopping, need an idea of budget and style. (I would bet that my first choices for shopping may not be yours). Little Island has opened since you were last here. And there are two Immersive Van Gogh exhibits that have been very popular.\\nWhat did you enjoy the last time you were here?\\nPerhaps read some trip reports to get some ideas. But if you give a bit more info on your interests, it would be easier to make suggestions. \" We usually have lots of plans made but this time I think we will \"wing it\"!!\"\\nSo what are you interested in doing? If you are a \"say yes to the dress\" fan I\\'d make an appointment to look at dresses at Kleinfeld\\'s. They are very expensive so don\\'t go in thinking you\\'ll buy but just for the experience. I have a friend who went there shopping for her wedding dress & actually made it onto the show but it was obvious when I saw the episode that she had no intention of buying a dress there but it was an experience. Making an appointment with a consultant (who works on commission) just for funsies, with absolutely no intention of purchasing, is rude.\\nEdited: 9:32 am, August 29, 2021 Little Island and the Ferris wheel in Times Square are new attractions Thanks for all the help suggestions!\\nProbably not Kleinfelds- although I love the show!!!

Have fun! For the dress, I would check Saks Off Fifth or even Saks itself which usually has a floor with sale items.\\nAs a new place, you might want to check out Citrovia which is really nice to look at and take a load off your feet for a few minutes (https://secretnyc.co/citrovia-nyc/)\\nI was there last weekend and one place I forgot to check out is the Elizabeth Street Garden (I\\'ll go back): https://www.elizabethstreetgarden.com/\\nIn Central Park, there is new monument on the Mall called the Womens Rights Pioneers: https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations/womens-rights-pioneers-monument\\nOne more option is a visit to the MET\\'s rooftop to see the blue big bird and there is also a nice Tiffany Egg collection. NYC up the Hudson; 2-3 hours Yes, great idea, hope you enjoy. Here are some options:\\nhttps://sail-nyc.com/browse-by-theme/fall-foliage/\\nJust like the weather, it\\'s hard to predict when peak color will occur. It may or may not coincide with your time here. When are you planning this? As springerandy suggested, planning this trip for a given time frame may not pan out. I planned a tulip festival trip to Ottawa once & half the tulips sere gone. I also took a trip to New Hampshire which was advertised as a fall foliage trip & the leaves started turning on the way back hoem. This is another cruise to look into: https://seastreak.com/daytrips-and-getaways/fall-foliage-cruises/\\nEarly November is best for going up the Hudson for best colours, and NYC itself is a few weeks behind so mid-November is still good, especially Central Park. Each year is different though.\\nThis website has a Fall Report that gets updated each week showing where colours are just starting or at their peak or past peak. Upstate New York starts first then works south.\\nIt hasn\\'t been updated since last November for obvious reasons, but should start to be updated again sometime in October.\\nhttps://www.iloveny.com/things-to-do/fall/foliage-report/ The big problem is selecting the right date. Generally, the leaves change sooner up the river. The \"heat reservoir\" of Manhattan is not conducive to the best color. Rain and temperatures all figure into the equation. I know it’s several days out, but it looks like the remnants of Ida are predicted to pass over the city Thursday morning. We’re flying into LaGuardia Thursday afternoon. Any prognostication or resources about flight cancelations/delays that I can monitor as the day gets closer, aside from weather forecasts? If there ends up being low visibility and heavy rain it can slow things down, possibly resulting in ground stops or worse at airports from which LGA flights might be coming. All you can do is watch the weather reports and look for messages from your airline. I would be watching for visibility, how heavy rain and how strong winds. Airlines sometimes preemptively cancel flights in deteriorating weather situations and if they think a plane is going to get stuck somewhere in bad weather. Likewise, if your plane did get stuck at LGA or elsewhere in bad weather, it might not be available for your flight. All you can do is wait and watch weather reports. You could also wait a day or two and if weather outlook continues bad, try to switch res to a sunny day. I think I would also look at reports from LGA for how many delays, cancelations there are Thurs am and Wednesday, when I believe rain is also expected. Weather forecasts are good for only 36 hours out & even then can be wrong. However, the track of the storm is over land, not water so I would think the rain & wind wouldn\\'t be nearly as bad as it is now over Louisiana. Here in Syracuse the forecast is not all that bad & we could be more in the storm\\'s path than NYC but these storms tend to wobble quite a bit. If you want a local forecast check out the web sites of local tv such as NY1. You don\\'t list where you live or mention where you’re flying from. There will be an issue with planes not being where they,re supposed to be.\\nhttps://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/search\\nFlightaware.com Ida likely won’t even be considered a tropical depression by Thursday.\\nIt will be a rainstorm. And probably a big one.\\nBut not the kind of event that closes airports and has airlines moving planes to avoid it.\\nDelays? Sure. They’re possible. Maybe a few cancellations depending on where your aircraft is coming from.\\nJust keep an eye on your airline’s website for updates. ***If you want a local forecast check out the web sites of local tv such as NY1.***\\nI don\\'t know about all of the local channels here, but our channel 7 (ABC) uses Accuweather for their forecasts.\\nHere is a site that shows flight radar:\\nhttps://www.flightradar24.com\\nWith storms like this, we won\\'t know until it gets much closer. Last weekend we saw remnants of a hurricane that came up the coast. It rained all weekend, but we did not get the wind that was originally forecasted. I guess I should’ve mentioned that I am flying from Nashville, and we’re expected to get several inches of rain from ida on Tuesday, with flash flood watches already issued. The storms\\nPath is pretty much identical to the flight path from BNA to NY. I suspect airlines will hesitate to put equipment in Nashville\\nI\\'d probably wait and see what your airline does about cancellations / flight change offers - they may make decisions soon Ida will be over and done in Nashville, as a tropical depression, on Tuesday.\\nLook at the weather forecast; the rain is gone by Tuesday night. Thursday is sunny and 82.\\nI can certainly imagine flight disruptions happening on Monday and Tuesday. And maybe some residual issues on Wednesday.\\nI’d be very surprised if there were storm-related flight issues on Thursday. In my experience airports rarely close. Airlines may cancel flights, but airports generally don\\'t close. Maybe in a hurricane or really serious blizzard where the runways aren\\'t clean an airport closes. However, they (LGA in particular) may slow things down to keep more distance between planes in bad weather. They may say to each airline something like \"reduce your flights by 30%,\" then it\\'s up to the airlines to decide where they are going to cut or hold flights at their origin airports. The residual effects can go on for some time, with planes & passengers backing up all over the country over a period of hours, so delays can last long after sun comes out.\\nA very major weather event like a blizzard or hurricane can result in travel problems that go on for days because many planes and crews are out of position when the bad weather passes. And I doubt it\\'s going to be any easier to get things back to normal these days when there are already many delays and cancelations said to be caused by plane and crew shortages.\\nIt\\'s really hard to say what you may encounter. Be careful not to assume that because the sun comes out Thursday morning your flight will be on as normal. If it\\'s very.important for you to be here next weekend, maybe you should consider leaving early. My family and I will be traveling to NYC for a long weekend in October. I am looking for a hotel near Times Square or the Theatre District where we can walk to dinner and shows. Currently, I have a room reserved at the Knickerbocker that a friend recommended. I got a really good rate when I booked 6 mths ago for a junior corner suite king bed. My issue is that we need to sleep 4 people in 3 separate spaces. My husband and I in the king bed, 15 yr old daughter on the couch (not pulled out) and a friend (male) on a rollaway. The room is almost 600sf but looking at pictures, there doesn’t seem to be a good space for a rollaway bed. There’s a lot of wasted hall and bathroom space. I called the hotel and they said they would make a note on the reservation that we need to accommodate a rollaway but I’m worried it won’t work.\\nI’m exploring other options and am having a hard time finding a suite or comparably sized room. I don’t want to give up the view, room size, or location. Quality still needs to be nice but it’s ok if the style is different than the Knickerbocker, especially if it’s a newer/more modern hotel. My budget is $400-500/night. Hotel rates can fluctuate significantly by dates. You\\'ll get better suggestions if you offer exact dates. Honestly I don\\'t see how you can expect 3 separate “spaces” unless you book a 2 bedroom suite with someone on a sofa bed in the living room.. If you just mean 3 beds, you can find rooms with 2 double beds and sofabed (Marriott Marquis) or maybe 2 queen beds and sofabed. (Conrad midtown 2 queen beds and sofa in living room). Even though I do a lot of theater, I tend not to lodge right in Times Square per se but head to hotels to the east & the west so that I can get out of the theater district\\'s busy sidewalks asap. I find it\\'s much less stressful. I took it to mean you would like 3 beds, rather than 3 bedrooms. I hope that\\'s what you meant.\\nI looked at the Kimpton Muse which is in your preferred location which might suit you. Recent reviews have been pretty good.\\nThey have a Two Queen Bed room within your budget (I did a random 4 night long weekend in October) but you\\'d need to look into whether they have rollaways available. That room is quite large (around 320sqft) and quite modern.\\nChoosing a non-refundable rate is cheaper but seeing that the visit is not until October, maybe look at the refundable rate just to be safe.\\nIf you join the IHG rewards program you\\'ll get the rate cheaper again.\\nhttps://www.themusehotel.com/\\nI also did a quick look at booking.com and the total looks like it could be cheaper there, compared to the hotel\\'s own website, but please confirm as I only did a very quick look. Also looking at booking.com, The Iroquois hotel has a One Bedroom suite (around 630sqft) that has a separate bedroom with a King bed plus a sofa bed in the living area. Look into whether a rollaway is allowed.\\nLook at the hotels\\' own website too.\\nRecent reviews there are Excellent mainly. New York is so (so) walkable, you can stay virtually anywhere in Manhattan and reach a good place for dinner and/or go to a show. Likewise, you can easily hop on a subway.\\nWalking around NYC across neighborhoods is a time honored experience for many of us. Find a good hotel at a rate you like and reserve it regardless of where it’s located: Upper West Side; Bryant Park; Financial District, etc. By “spaces”, I mean a separate bed or sleeping area like a couch or rollaway. 2 queens and a pullout couch would work as well as 2 queens and a rollaway or any sort of suite. I just don’t want a 250 sf room with those options. I don\\'t think you\\'ll find what you want at that price. So starting with the Knickerbocker\\n- have you included the cost of their daily resort fee in your calculation of what you have?\\n- will they charge extra for a roll away?\\n-typically, hotels that don\\'t have floor space for a roll away won’t offer one. I would call during the week and ask to speak to the manager. If there is floor space, I think what you have is perhaps your best option. You might want to. check whether their 2 queen rooms are better laid out for a roll away bed. The rooms at the Knick are huge and while the building is old, it was gut renovated when it opened.\\nThe Michelangelo has huge rooms (some with 2 king beds!) but decor is not modern and there aren,t views.\\nThe Conrad Midtown will work in a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds but the sofa is likely not a pull out and it will be more $$\\nhttps://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/nyccnci-conrad-new-york-midtown/?SEO_id=GMB-CI-NYCCNCI&y_source=1_ODQyMDQyMy03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24uZ29vZ2xlX3dlYnNpdGVfb3ZlcnJpZGU%3D\\nI don\\'t think the rooms at the Muse are any bigger. The Iroquois has no views.\\nThere are a number of suite hotels that would have the bedding you want but not in Times Square (midtown east) and not as modern. If you want to have a look, the nicest are\\nAffinia 50\\nAffinia Gardens\\nSan Carlos\\nKimberly Thanks!\\nBoth the Affinia hotels look perfect in terms of rooms, but are not in the ideal location - but I may consider. Which location of the two has easiest access to transport/subway?\\nWe stayed in Times Square two years ago and loved being able to walk outside the hotel and immediately feel immersed. The Affinia hotels are more like serviced apartments. Neither have on site bars or restaurants afaik. That said, I noticed the Knickerbocker rooftop bar is open and one restaurant is open for buffet breakfast but nothing else. That could change by Oct.\\nAffinia 50 is not far from Rockefeller Center and Saks. Affinia Gardens is on a quiet block but close to Bloomingdales in one direction a nod Central Park is another. They are not glamorous but certainly not dumpy. As ai recall, both building we built as apartments (but they have been legal hotels for years). So bathrooms are average size and not very glam. There’s also Affinia Shelburne which is near Grand Central Terminal. They do have a restaurant a d a rooftop bar (if it\\'s open). You are not guaranteed views in these although some rooms do have them. The Shelburne has some rooms with views of the Empire State. It,s very close to the Chrysler building too. Heading to NYC in October. We\\'ll make dinner reservations for certain, but for lunch can we just walk up, or are most restaurants requiring reservations?\\nWhole family has been vaccinated and we\\'ll have our cards handy. That entirely depends on the restaurants you are going to: causal restaurants, just wait up; fine dining: make a rez. It also depends on when you visit and how popular a place is. Holiday weekends or around holidays are better with reservations. It\\'s easier to make a reservation and cancel than wing it. It also means you have to do so,e research ahead of time which will likely get you better meals. A lot of,places around tourist attractions are overpriced and may not be great food. If you prefer last minute decisions, use the search nearby function on Google maps to find options near wherever you are. Yelp and\\nEater.com\\nGrubhub.com\\nare good places to look at reviews. I should also add that if you have a larger party, you should make a reservation to insure that you won’t have to wait. I can think of very few places that require reservations for lunch - but then, I don\\'t tend to go to buzzy, high-end places for lunch (and not often for dinner, either, if truth be told). So unless there\\'s a particular, super-popular place where you\\'re dying to eat lunch, and that place takes reservations, I wouldn\\'t worry about it.\\nThe way I travel, having to arrange my morning to be at a particular lunch spot at a particular time would be a major hassle and interfere with the pleasure of leisurely exploring. Obviously travel styles vary and YMMV, but the trade-off between the certainty reservations provide and the flexibility/spontaneity of just walking into a place that looks appealing is worth considering. That goes for dinner as well: you will NOT go hungry if you don\\'t make dinner reservations, but you may not be able to get into (or have to wait for a table at) specific places. To get the best advice, if you have specific places you are considering for lunch, please name them. A place like The Smith, for example, is casual. But whenever I have gone there for lunch, I make a reservation. Are there plenty of other places that are similar where you don’t need a rez? Absolutely. But if that’s on your to-do list, then a reservation is advisable. A lot depends what time you want to have lunch. 1230 pm and 230 pm are much easier to obtain than 1-230. If you really want to dine at a given restaurant regardless of what meal, IMNSHO reservations are always a good idea. However, I have been known to just wander &, if a restaurant is fully committed walk on & find another place. OK, all of the responders suggesting reservations have made me curious . . . the OP has stated that they plan to make reservations for dinner. When you travel, do you generally make reservations for both lunch and dinner? Maybe I\\'m an outlier, but I don\\'t think I\\'ve *ever* done that. Sometimes I do one or the other, often neither, but never both.\\nDoesn\\'t it make you just a little tense, to have to get to an assigned place at an assigned time twice a day? Depends on the vacation Linda. And I don’t necessarily read it that they are eating big lunches and dinners every day and every night. I just answer the question asked without trying to read more into it.\\nThere are places that I would make reservations for, even if I wasn’t having a full dinner (like that speakeasy place in the theater district - can’t think of the name of it right now if I wanted to go pre or post theater). Or cocktail places in the Raines Law Group where I may only have appetizers. You just can’t get seated without a rez (most of the time). Or lunch at Bergdorf Goodman - I rarely go there but it is a super pretty room and lovely experience, even if you’re only having a salad or something light. You need a reservation or expect a long wait. (Im more intrigued by people who have three meals a day - I rarely have more then coffee and maybe a croissant, and people ask about these big breakfasts all of the time, along w where to have lunch). And people often get the recommendation on this board to go to upscale/up price restaurants at lunch - definitely need rez for that. Then you may have a light dinner. But still need a rez if it’s someplace unique. LInda, it’s not about what I do but providing best info for OP. Posting now, I think maybe they\\'re coming next weekend when places will be crowded.. And/or maybe they want to go to some place well known like Norma’s or Balthazar.\\nYea, what Risa said.🤗 My daughter will be getting married on the waterfront in DUMBO July of 2022. The wedding party/attendants including bride & groom will be under 25 persons, most likely closer to 20.\\nWe\\'ve been checking into a number of hotels in that area or close on the Manhattan side. We\\'d like affordable suite, along with cheaper options for those who can\\'t afford the splurge, a room large enough for the bridal party to get ready in and a bonus would be a suite that would allow us enough room to have a catered dinner the night before the wedding without breaking the bank and a space for cake cutting after the wedding ceremony and photos.\\n1 Brooklyn Bridge Hotel is in an ideal location with great views, but no balcony or terraced rooms, smaller rooms and super pricey. I\\'ve researched other hotels on the Brooklyn side and am not finding one that has all that we\\'re looking for.\\nI think Mr. C Seaport Hotel may just be the perfect choice, but some recent negative reviews. have me a bit concerned. There are plenty of fantastic reviews as well. I\\'ve contacted the hotel inquiring about their Signature and Mr. C Suites asking if they had a website link that showed video room tours. The front desk manager was kind enough to offer to video each of the suites once the rooms are vacant and send them to me. That offer was greatly appreciated.\\nThe Mr. C Suite offers -\\nPrivate 558 sq ft furnished wrap-around terrace with seating for 16 persons\\nw/ Brooklyn Bridge & East River Views\\nOne Bedroom Suite\\nSofa, two chairs, desk and chair\\nKing bed 1.5 bathrooms l Bathtub\\n566 square feet\\nIt seems like it\\'s a clear winner for the following reasons:\\n1. accommodations for bride & groom\\n2. plenty of space for the bridal party to get ready, 1.5 bathrooms & terrace photo ops w/ BB views\\n3. outdoor/indoor seating space for a simple catered dinner the night before the wedding\\n4. outdoor/indoor seating space for wedding cake cutting/champagne toast after ceremony & photos\\n5. Good location for ease getting to DUMBO\\n6. Rates for smaller rooms are affordable.\\n7. $2,850 for two nights in the suite seems like a deal for all that it can be used for\\nSo after all of that my question is has anyone had any experience staying here? I have not stayed there nor have I seen the rooms. However, I have been to the restaurant on the ground floor, Bellini, a number of times. The hotel and restaurant are both owned Cipriani. The restaurant is excellent, both food and ESPECIALLY, service. They\\'re so nice and so charmingly attentive. It\\'s the kind of attention one would want for a wedding party. Sounds like you researched your way into a good choice. I\\'ve not been to this hotel since it became Mr. C. Seaport. It was previously a Best Western I THINK built inside an historic building. I discovered it belongs to the group Leading Hotels of the World and they probably have more photos online than the hotel itself. Here,s the link\\nhttps://www.lhw.com/hotel/Mr-C-Seaport-New-York-NY-USA?rooms=1&numadult1=2&numchild1=0\\nI would be concerned given some of the reviews you referenced, especially in terms of service attitude. Given you don\\'t live that far, I would hope you,d make a trip up to check whatever you’re considering in person.\\nYou talk about a catered dinner. Are you planning on having the hotel cater it or were you planning on bringing food in from outside? If the latter, have you checked whether they\\'ll allow it?\\nAre you sure that it\\'s practical that the same suite could be used for all those things (getting ready, sleeping, dinner, drinks, cake) in such a short period of time? I think you,ll need at least 1 other space is not 2 for some of that.\\nThere are so many hotels in Fidi. Did you check the World Center Hotel and the Club Quarters Fidi?\\nAll the best of luck to the couple and your family. Thank you all for the advice and input.\\nThe front desk manager went above and beyond delivering excellent customer service when she videoed the suite we were interested in and sent it to me. Here it is for those who may be considering Mr. C Seaport. https://youtu.be/4AYk9DrifRw\\nAfter much thought and research, again, we have decided that Mr. C Seaport is not the wedding property for us. It may have served the purpose for all of our needs, been in an ideal location for easy access to the ceremony site, but the room was rather drab and ordinary, though it was large and had BB views. Also, the concerning reviews actually became a blessing as we have chosen a different property, The Ludlow may be further away from the wedding site, be in a grittier part of the city, but it has character with a moody, chic vibe perfectly fitting for their vision of a hotel choice. The skybox loft room would be perfect for getting ready on her wedding day. Sounds great! Fwiw, the Bowery hotel and the Greenwich hotel have similar looks but I think the Ludlow will be great. Lots of good luck. Great choice. Cool place. A friend and I will be doing a girls\\' trip to NYC in December to do the theater, art museums, etc and are looking for a hotel near the theaters and subway. Our budget is around $300-350 per room per night. We would like free wifi, breakfast, and cancellation if possible. Any suggestions? Look at the Residence Inn Central Park. It’s not right in the theater district but an easy walk. Rooms are small but well designed with kitchens and all Residence Inns include breakfast. The views from this hotel are awesome. It,s also well located to get to the museums. There\\'s also a Residence Inn Times Square that\\'s also near the theaters but not as new . Hampton Inns also include breakfast and there are several in the Times Square area. The one called Times Square North is older but has big rooms. The Element might work for you. A little south of the theaters but has breakfast and a kitchenette. No specific recommendation, but I also do theater marathons & I stay either east or west of the theater district so that I have a short walk but get out of the overcrowded post theater sidewalks. Prices fluctuate dramatically by date, especially in Dec. if you’re talking about the first weekend in Dec., that\\'s one of the most expensive times (.first weekend after Xmas tree lighting) and your budget will likely not work. Just a heads up. I will be staying at Holiday Inn Express in Union Street in Brooklyn and want to go by subway. How can I manage this? I know step one is to take the air train. You can take the AirTrain to Howard Beach and then the Manhattan bound A train. Get off at Jay Street/MetroTech and then take the R train, bound for 95th Street Bay Ridge to Union Street.\\nAnother alternative is to take the AirTrain to Jamaica, then the Long Island Rail Road to Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, then the N or R subway one stop to Union Street. I live in the area and routinely take the subway to/from JFK & surrounding areas. The best route is to take the *Howard Beach* (not Jamaica) bound Airtrain. At the Howard Beach station, you’ll change to the A train heading toward Manhattan (not Far Rockaway). Stay on the A train until the Jay St-Metrotech stop in Brooklyn. There, you’ll transfer to a Bay Ridge-bound R train. Union St is just a few more stops.\\nI don’t know anything about the hotel, but Park Slope and Gowanus are great neighborhoods - have fun! Cross-posted with AH…the LIRR works too; potentially a bit faster (assuming you don’t have to wait a long time for the LIRR, they’re not super-frequent), but a bit more expensive. Hi! I\\'m looking for a reasonably priced (if possible!) hotel in Times Square with parking and a good view from a room with 2 beds for 3 nights in December. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated- Thank you! What is your budget per night, do you have exact dates, and how many people? Marriot Marquis has room with views of Times Square, I dont know the rates honestly, but it might be cheaper now because of fewer tourists Thank you!\\nThere\\'s two of us and we\\'re staying 12/2-12/5. I\\'d like to keep my budget to under $500 if I could :) We had a great stay at the Marriott Marquis just last month. The rooms are large by NYC standards and seemed very recently updated. The view from our room overlooking Times Square was awesome. We really loved our room and the property (great fitness center and cool elevators). We had a military rate, but the regular rates I saw were competitive. Look for deals. We did not have a car, but I believe parking is valet-only and priced around $100 per day. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum posting guidelines with prohibiting self-promotional advertising or solicitation.\\nWe ask all of our members to keep their forum messages free of self-promoting advertisements or solicitation of any kind - members affiliated with any tourism-related business should not include commercial contact information or URLs in their forum messages.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 6:24 pm, August 28, 2021 Not sure if you mean $500 for 3 nights or per night. You\\'ll struggle with that price for 1 night. Those dates tend to be some of the most expensive of the year (first weekend after tree lighting) and rooms with 2 beds are typically more expensive than rooms with 1 despite number of people. Also most hotels don\\'t have their own garage. They may offer a rate including parking but will take your car to an independent garage and charge extra for the convenience.

I think M Social might come closest to what you want. On their own website pick stay longer save more deal and join the Millenium frequent guest program (online for free) to save another $20/night. You can pick various views.\\nYou can find out whether they have a parking rate. Using spothero, the cheapest I see nearby is $90 for 3 nights. Thank you - again!!

Thanks! 1 train from 50th and 7th to South Ferry.\\nEdited: 2:33 pm, August 25, 2021 Note, officially the stop is Broadway and 50th, but there is an entrance off of 7th. Look for subway signage, make sure you enter a DOWNTOWN entrance. There are multiple subway routes that can work\\nStarting from there the easiest will be to walk over to 7th Ave and take the downtown (south) bound W or R train from the 49th Street station to South Ferry / Bowling Green. (Note for this particular trip you do not want the N or Q trains that go elsewhere) OR, as mentioned above, the 1 at 50th and Bway (Other routes are possible but would require free in-station train transfers)\\nIf you wander around downtown a bit you are likely to be near other subway options for your return uptown.

Thank you for the info. Now is the 7 day Metro City pass worth it even though we will only be there 4 days? Thanks for the reply. I took a $10 pass which is $9 for rides and $1 for the card, that only covered 3 rides as each ride is $2.75\\nI travel solo so I am not sure, but I do believe the 7 day pass can be shared between 2 persons, I am sure someone else on this forum can confirm if that is the case. **Now is the 7 day Metro City pass worth it even though we will only be there 4 days?**\\nAbsolutely.\\nDon\\'t judge it by how many days you are here. Judge it by how many rides you take.\\n**but I do believe the 7 day pass can be shared between 2 persons,**\\nIt can, but there is a 18 minute lockout time between swipes. It is never a good idea to share unlimited cards. Each person will need their own card. The unlimited pass cannot be shared between people travelling together. The unlimited pass is a no brainer for 4 days, especially travelling with a child in December. If the weather turns bad, or someone\\'s legs are tired, you can hop on a bus or subway without having to calculate if you have enough left on your pay per ride card. I walk about 10 miles per day in NYC, in addition to taking multiple subway and bus rides each day. I don\\'t plan out my daily itinerary with such precision that I know exactly where I will be and never travel in a different direction on the spur of the moment. On a number of our December NYC visits we have taken the Staten Island Ferry roundtrip from a midtown area hotel. After the Staten Island ferry, we then walk to Wall St/Pier 11 ferry terminal to catch another ferry over to DUMBO, walk around that area eat and walk over the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset.\\nFor us it was an easy routing taking 1 Train to the South Ferry stop which is right next to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. From the SI Ferry Terminal it\\'s an easy 10 minute walk to Pier 11/Wall St. The 8 minute ferry ride over to DUMBO is quick, but scenic and enjoyable.\\nThis link should help you with your Staten Island routing/ferry info https://freetoursbyfoot.com/staten-island-ferry/#plan\\nHere\\'s the East River Ferry info https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/east-river/\\nSome DUMBO info https://freetoursbyfoot.com/things-to-do-dumbo/\\nHope this helps! We plan to stay in the theatre district in March to be able to walk to shows. Which hotel is better for comfortable rooms, size of rooms, updated or at least in good condition. The rooms at the Michelangelo are some of the largest in NYC and their bathrooms are really large with separate shower and then soaking tubs. The downside is the hotel may appear somewhat dated (unless work,s been done while they were closed). Many rooms at the Sanctuary are quite small. So small that the bathrooms are basically IN the sleeping area.\\nhttp://www.sanctuaryhotelnyc.com/sanctuary-superior-queen-,rooms_viewItem_3-en.html\\nThe Samxtuary may be more up to date in appearance, but the Michelangelo is imo much more comfortable.\\n. We’ve never stayed at Sanctuary but love the Michelangelo Hotel; we also like the Park Central Hotel on 7th btwn W55/56th.\\nWherever you decide to stay check out their ‘resort fees’ and what they cover to see if you’ll take advantage of those amenities that you will be paying for if you use them it not; some may include onsite parking, fitness facilities, continental breakfast, etc. or offer special rates or packages.\\nEdited: 5:10 pm, August 27, 2021 We are traveling with our 14 year old grandson so I think I will choose the Michelangelo because rooms are larger\\nand because it is closer to the Richard Rodgers Theatre on 46th Street.\\nThank you. My impression of the Sanctuary (have not stayed there) is that it is an old SRO hotel that has been cheaply tarted up when what it needs is a gut renovation. “Come From Away” the Broadway musical about the people stranded in Newfoundland after the Sept. 11 attacks was filmed live and will be available to stream on Apple TV.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af77C4zUkjs Thank you! I hadn\\'t seen that. We saw before it was a big hit. We knew it was more than special! Thanks for that nywhiz. I thought Come From Away was one of the very best shows I\\'ve ever seen. and I\\'ve seen a few. I don\\'t know whether I can source Apple TV but believe me I will be researching. Thanks for posting nywhiz, I\\'ve passed the link on to my former Detroit Fisher theater season ticket holder friends.\\nWe enjoyed the show during our last NYC visit in December 2019.\\nMy mother and her friends were on a bus trip from Michigan to Montreal on 9/11 and were treated equally well by our Canadian neighbors.\\nEdited: 8:56 am, August 27, 2021 We saw \"Come From Away\" in November 2019. For some reason I still can\\'t process 9/11 and as soon as the show started, I started tearing up. I\\'m also in the 2nd row. I loved the show even though I had to look away often since I was becoming so overwhelmed. I finally pulled myself together (mostly) by the end. I look forward to sitting by myself and watching it again and letting the emotions out. I think you will see alot more broadway shows streaming going forward, but more on a pay per view , Until international travel comes back it will be the only way shows will be able to survive and even after many might do it for extra incomes IIRC most Broadway shows are documented on film at some point for historical purposes.\\nA friend of mine who was doing a PhD in theater history was able to get special permission to view some show films related to her topic (@ the Lincoln Center NYPL IIRC)\\nPay-per-view likely wouldn\\'t keep many performers crew and staff employed for long (Assume some would get residual payments) Seen this in NY in 2019 amazing show. Hope to see this. There’s a paywall. Can you summarize the news? Are these hotels in New York City? NYC hotels mentioned in the article that will require guests to show proof of vaccination are Public, Equinox, and Wythe, plus Urban Cowboy Lodge in the Catskills and Pilgrim House in Provincetown, MA. Also, Puerto Rico has passed legislation requiring all hotel and Airbnb guests to be vaccinated, and Ellis island Resorts, an operator of Caribbean resorts, will require guests to be vaccinated. Interestingly, the article says that at Equinox hotels, its guests must be vaccinated, but its staff is not required to be vaccinated Hi there! Pending the UK to US travel ban being lifted we are hoping to visit NYC later this year. We have a 12 year old who hasn\\'t been vaccinated (Under 16\\'s aren\\'t being vaccinated in the UK) and worried that will mean we won\\'t be allowed to visit/eat in any indoor venues due to the new vaccine passport. Any idea if there will be any discretion for children who aren\\'t being offered the vaccine yet??? Thanks Here are the rules\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page\\nYou may have to defer your trip until your child can be vaccinated. Thanks for the reply. Hopefully the UK will make the vaccine available to children soon then! Currently no plans as far as I can see :-( I am hoping for later in September for 5-12 in the US. This is going to be an issue for us too. My 16yr old has had one vaccine but at the moment the U.K. are not planning on giving this age group a 2nd one. Hi,\\nI decided to book World Center Hotel in NYC (discounted price) for 9/6-9/10. It\\'s pretty close to White Hall ferry (I\\'ll park at Empire Outlet - Staten island ferry to Manhattan). I\\'ve been to NYC twice before covid-19 pandemic during Christmas (it was too cold for me to walk so many places). Here is my plan during stay:\\nday 1: I\\'ll drive from Washington DC to Staten Island Ferry (expect to be there around 10am - take ferry to Manhattan. Drop off a small luggage at hotel (I hope they let me).\\nwalk to 9/11 memorial, Brooklyn Bridge (I still don\\'t know which gate to get to this bridge yet), then may have lunch at Dumbo.\\nTake ferry from Dumbo back to Manhattan - check in hotel and refresh - walk around downtown and head to Chinatown for dinner. Question: is it safe to walk to Brooklyn bridge at night? (I heard it\\'s beautiful to view city light from the bridge)\\nDay 2: Walk to Battery Park to take Statue City Cruises Battery Park/ Liberty Island ( I guess it takes 1/2 day to visit)\\nVisit mid-town and want to take train to visit Columbia University and south end of Central park ( will have lunch and dinner in mid-town too)\\nDay 3: Go to Chinatown in Flushing (Queens) for food. Then come back Manhattan to visit Grand Central station and United Nations and other attractions along the way. Back to hotel and ready for check out next morning to go back Staten Island ferry.\\nThanks. **Drop off a small luggage at hotel (I hope they let me).**\\nI have not been to any hotel in the world that did not let me drop off my luggage prior to checkin.\\n**Question: is it safe to walk to Brooklyn bridge at night? (I heard it\\'s beautiful to view city light from the bridge)\\n**\\nIs it safe in what sense?\\n-Crime? Absolutely.\\n-Falling off the bridge? Absolutely.\\nIt is great walking the bridge at night seeing the skyline lit up. I actually walked the bridge during Superstorm Sandy and it was weird seeing parts of the city with no lights. You relaize its about 40 mins from Midtown to Flushing Queens by Subway?\\nI wouldn\\'t go to Flusing Queens just for food, if you are going to Flushing, go to Flushing Meadow Park and see the Unisphere, the NY State Pavilion and the Queens Museum (It has the relief map of NYC there)\\nif you are going to Columbia, go see Grants Tomb and Riverside Park, Not Central Park Howard and I have different attitudes toward food! I would totally go to Flushing for food & the general experience (and have, on many occasions, even though it’s an even longer trip coming from Brooklyn). I totally agree with him about the coolness of Flushing Meadows park and the Queens Museum, though…especially the Panorama and the small Worlds Fair(s) exhibit.\\nNo safety concerns walking the Brooklyn Bridge at night…in fact, it’s a great time to do it. Just be mindful of the bike lane (at least until the new lane on the roadway level opens).\\nI wasn’t sure what you meant by this:\\n>>> I still don\\'t know which gate to get to this bridge yet <<<\\nDo you mean subway stop? General route? The answer will depend on where you’re coming from.\\nEdited: 3:57 pm, August 27, 2021 My issue is going to Flushing just for food, that I dont agree with, but if you make it a general stop in Flushing, then its a good idea. The Unisphere, New York State Pavillion and Queens Museum would normally be a top rated stop (Especially the Unisphere) if it was someplace else in the city\\nThis is the Unisphere in the Winter, so you can get an idea\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CLSR9zgrXG_/ Thank you all for your suggestion. I will visit Unisphere before heading to town for food (I heard so much review about authentic chinese foods, so I wanna try). It\\'s probably a long walk. To answer Linda E about the entrance to brooklyn bridge - Since I\\'ll stay at Holiday Inn in financial district (sorry I just cancel World Center Hotel since I get better price at Holiday Inn), I just want to know how to get in the brooklyn bridge. google maps does not tell me much.\\nthanks again.\\nEdited: 6:29 pm, August 27, 2021 Be aware its about a 2 mile walk from the Unisphere to Main St and Roosevelt Ave (downtown Flushing)\\nThe Unisphere, Queens Museum and the New York State Pavillion are all next to each other. You definately want to go to the Queens Museum and see the NYC relief (its a map of every building in NYC) Also in that area is the Hall of Science, Outside of the Hall of Science are some pretty cool rocket Ships, they were the Shells of Rocket Prototypes from NASA I would take the ferry over to Dumbo and walk the BB back to Manhattan. Views are better this way.\\nFrom the 9/11 Memorial walk to Pier 11 (for the ferry to Dumbo) via Wall Street and the Stock Exchange and Federal Hall. This is a very historic area, and you\\'ll see a few more sights along the way. (Trinity Church and St Paul\\'s Chapel might be good, small, detours). I have the Queens Iternary for you\\nTake #7 train to the 111th St station\\nWalk to the Hall of Science and see the Rocket Ship Park\\nThen walk to the Unisphere, Queens Museum and New York State Pavillion (They are all in the same area)\\nNow there are 2 ways to go\\nYou can Walk directly to Citifield and then Walk to Main St and Roosevelet Ave (Where all the restarants are) or you can walk indirectly through the Pools and founaints (There are some interesting statues here) and then go to Citifield.\\nFlushing Meadow Park can be a little tricky so you could get lost\\nIf you are still interested, In Flushing there are 3 interesting sites in this area\\nThe Quaker Meeting House, One of the oldest houses of Worship in the US, It does from the 17th centuray\\nAnd a few more blocks is The Bowne House which is the 3rd Oldest Building in NYC and the Kingland Estate, which dates from 1785\\nThe walk back to Main St and Roosevelt Ave\\nIf you just go to MainS t and Roosevelt Ave and miss the Pre-revilutionry war sites, go to ear at the New World Mall Food court, thats where you want to go to ear. Real Asian food, not for tourists Its 2,5 Miles from the Unisphere/Queens Museum to the Bowne House (The furtherest Distance) you can Uber this (The Kingsland house is behind the Bowne House) and then walk back past the Quaker Meeting house and the New World Mall and the Subway. at Main and Rosevelt I am from San Francisco and often use Uber as it is faster and much cheaper than a taxi cab and often faster as I can get a ride is usually under 10 minutes. I love the NYC subway, but am also trying to be cautious of large crowds due to COVID-19. I ride the subway in SF, but the ridership has gone down tremendously so the trains are less than half-full.\\nHow has the ridership changed in NYC? Are the train cars packaged like usual or are a significant portion of people avoiding using the subway (due to working from home, lack of work, etc.)?\\nSilly question, but how accessible is Uber in NYC? There are tons more taxis in NYC than in SF, so I am not sure how Uber is faring in NYC. It seems like Uber is leading the way in most cities and trumping using taxis, but not sure about the ridership in NYC. Do you use Uber often? Is it faster than hailing a cab? Do you prefer to use the subway and just walk to your destination? Just wondering how locals are getting around during covid-19. Subway. Maybe the compromise is to avoid it at peak rush hours and to use stops that are a bit less popular, if you have the choice. I use ride shares in most places but prefer to hail a taxi in NYC. Easier than coordinating meeting points, in most situations I have been in. The subway is the most economical and efficient way to get around the city.\\nIt\\'s that simple, but if you want to use a taxi or uber, go for it. Only you can decide. Not a local, but on my past 3 visits to NYC April, May and July 2021 I never rode the subway at all which was a first for me. I enjoy taking them, it\\'s part of the NYC experience. I did take cabs to/from bus/train station to/from hotel.\\nIn April on my first day, I suffered a minor injury in the Lower East Side area and needed a cab ASAP to get back to my hotel. It was tough finding one and I had to walk several blocks before I finally spotted one. The same situation when I was trying to find a cab to flag down once again on the Lower East Side the following day and ended up walking to where I needed to get to.\\nIn July, my daughter began feeling overheated and faint while we were walking and we tried to find a cab in Chinatown, with no luck. We got a ride back to the hotel using Uber and it cost a bit more than the cab would have cost, but arrived after an 8 minute wait. I have not been on the Subway Since Feb 2020. I normally drive now because of safety issue. I did take an Uber last week because I had a medical procedure and could not drive.\\nBe aware I live in Queens and the Subway rides are longer. its usually 30-45 Mins from me to Midtown Manhattan by Subway. Uber is a lot more money from Queens to manattan. if you are going short distances, take the Subway. if you are going to be on the train for longer , make you own decisions as the Uber will be more money I forgot to add that most of my trips are under $15, but SF is a small city of only 7x7 miles and dwarfs in comparison to Manhattan. Subway. Haven\\'t been since before the pandemic though, bear in mind but that is my first pick.\\nI use the subway a lot. And local buses.\\nIn total, I think I\\'ve taken a taxi twice in 9 visits - and I tend to be all over the place when visiting. Think end-of-the-subway-line in Brooklyn or The Bronx, for example.\\nUber or Lyft? Never. Don\\'t have a smart phone. Don\\'t need a smart phone.\\n(I don\\'t count a taxi from EWR or Penn station upon arriving in town, that\\'s in my mind part of the \\'transit\\' to get to the hotel along with flights, trains etc, nor do I count taking car services back to the airport for the same reason). Subway (also, though you didn’t mention them, buses). The Citibike bike share program is another option. My advice to visitors is to use these methods of transportation as much as possible - along with walking, they’re the best way to experience the city.\\nThe subway is fast, inexpensive, and continues to feel safe to me (in terms of both crime and Covid). Most people wear masks, though there’s usually one or two who don’t. Sometimes I’ll get in a car and see a bunch of people without masks - if that happens, I switch cars if possible.\\nI use taxis once in a great while - I think the last occasion was after my husband had surgery & we were coming home from the hospital. I did try to hail one recently - my visiting SIL had developed a blister from all her walking - with no luck. This was in Manhattan, where finding cabs isn’t generally an issue.\\nI use Uber/Lyft even less than taxis. Not a fan of the proliferation of for-hire vehicles (and private vehicles generally) because of the pollution & congestion they create. In a post pandemic world, after 8 or 9 at night, especially if I’ve been drinking, if a can’t walk (which I do, even at 11, 12 or later), cab or Uber. Used to not think twice about taking the subway late at night, but for now, I’m a little more cautious.\\nDuring the day, if I can’t walk, subway. At 11pm I would take a Taxi or Uber and not the Subway I usually take the bus or subway. Rarely a cab or an Uber unless someone else is paying. I take the subway at all hours both day and night and find the ridership is close to pre-pandemic levels. I do not worry about the subway since most people do wear a mask on the subway and I do mask up for public transportation. Hi we are planning my daughters 30th birthday for next year,there will be at least 8 of us (my wife and I have been 4 times),what would you think would be the best accommodation book 4 separate rooms or could we get an apartment with four rooms or even a large suite ,any advice would be appreciated it’s five years since we last visited New York. To get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station and 4) hotel budget.\\nIf you were considering a short term apartment rental\\nBe aware that the majority of AirBnB Style short term apartment rentals are illegal in all five boroughs of NYC\\nThey are illegal in any residential building with three or more units. The only potentially legal ones are in one or two family houses - which are uncommon in areas that are desirable or convenient for visitors https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/articles/liz-krueger/answers-new-yorkers-concerned-or-confused-about-illegal-hotel-law and https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/about-illegal-short-term-rentals.page\\nThe source of the offer does not matter - the legal classification of the building does. No internet middleman, even otherwise respectable or well known ones (AirBnB, Vrbo, etc), vets listings for compliance with local laws, leaving visitors vulnerable. First of all it really depends on your budget what would be best ,for me as a budget traveler the fewer rooms I purchased the better.\\nFour rooms of course would give two people one bathroom to share which would which would be nice.\\nI wouldn’t mess with Airbnb because it’s too complicated in NYC and you could potentially rent an illegal place ,so I wouldn’t do that myself.\\nGive us an idea of your budget IMO that will help you get better recommendations.\\nYou are 8 people but, Who exactly is traveling? How are they related? Are they all adults ? Any children?\\nEdited: 10:50 am, August 19, 2021 Thanks for the advice it will be for four adults in May ,not bothered about the budget within reason and I didn’t really want to pay the resort fees cheers 4 adults, you said in your original post that you were “at least eight”?\\nIf you’re not bothered about the budget and then get as many rooms as you can afford ,I say. . The less sharing of bathrooms the better.\\nUse this site To Check for resort fees\\nhttp://www.resortfeechecker.com/\\nEdited: 11:11 am, August 19, 2021 We have been Greenwich Village denizens for 50+ years. Here, we like the Washington Square Hotel just across the street from Washington Square Park in the heart of The Village and stay there when family comes to visit NYC and we give them our Village apartment. The area is vibrant with universities and attractions, close to SoHo and Chinatown for shopping, has great outdoor dining and has easily accessible public transportation. Many touristy attractions are within a 1-2 mile stroll from the Hotel.\\nNote: The Washington Square Hotel does not always list all of it\\'s room availabilities on the Internet. We have found that directly contacting the Hotel yields best results. For more information, see:\\nhttps://washingtonsquarehotel.com/\\nCH For me, I wouldn\\'t discount a hotel with a resort fee. What matters is how much you pay in total, not how the cost is parsed out. I agree # 6. But as it turns out I have never stayed at a hotel with a resort fee ever ( 10 years visiting nyc ) because they were never the best option moneywise. Sorry I have made a mistake it’s 8 adults it me and my wife and my daughters friends who are all around 30 . >>not bothered about the budget within reason and I didn’t really want to pay the resort fees…<<\\nExact Dates matter as well, as post 1 said, Hotel prices fluctuate by date.\\nWhat is a reasonable budget?\\nI would suggest four rooms with one bed each. You and your wife certainly want your own room and the Young women could each share a queen bed. This way only two people would have to share a bathroom.\\nBut that isn’t the only way you could go.\\nWhich hotel you choose depends on how much you want/can pay.\\nI don’t think it’s too early to be looking at potential hotels right now, but if you book anything this early make sure you can cancel it with out penalty of course.\\nDo you have set dates? With out that it’s hard to give specific hotel Recommendations. There are legal hotels with 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suites. Those also have sofabeds so in theory 6 could sleep in one of those rooms if some are willing to put up with a sofabed.\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nAffinia Gardens\\nand\\nRadiocityapartments.com\\n(The last a budget option) are some with 2 bed/2 bath. They also have studios and 1 bedrooms.\\nIf the 30 year olds are all single, the Freehand hotel which is newer and trendier has rooms with bunkbeds for 3 and maybe 4 people.\\nJust keep in mind most private apt. Rentals are illegal in Manhattan so while they,re advertises, it,s really like a black market and consequently lots of scams. The biggest scams seem to be from places that claim to sleep a large number of people. Scams include bait and switch and also booking and then cancelling last minute.\\nI’d you decide you want to book separate rooms for each couple and want help selecting a place, do give dates, bedding requiremmts and budget. Btw, agree it doesn,t matter whether a place charges a resort fee but what the final price will be.\\nRemember taxes add 15% to prices.\\nEdited: 5:10 pm, August 19, 2021 I’m visiting NYC next month for the first time and I’ve made an itinerary. I tried dividing everything by geographic locations. I’d also love food suggestions. I don’t want to spend ,more than 30-40$ daily on food (breakfast will be at hotel)\\nDay 1: I arrive early morning. Walk Central Park as much as I can and then check in at hotel and rest.\\nDay 2: Check out The Edge, the High Line, Greenwich Village, Union Square, Washington Square Park. Maybe a Broadway show\\nDay 3: Central midtown. Check Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Terminal , St Patrick Cathedral, United Nations, Time Square\\nDay 4: Brooklyn Bridge, Dumbo, and maybe Prospect Park. Any other recommendations nearby?\\nDay 5: Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Jackson Heights for food and then Gentry Park Plaza. Any other recommendations nearby?\\nDay 6: World Trade Center, Federal National Memorial, Trinity Church, Charging Bul, NY City Hall, Stateue of Liberty, Frances Tavern for food\\nDay 7: Met Museum and either walk the rest of Central park or Governors Island\\nDay 8: Either Bronx Zoo or pick a neighborhood and just wander and walk around. Maybe Williamsburg?\\nAny other recommendations are welcome except museums. Thanks veryone! Day 5: Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Jackson Heights for food and then Gentry Park Plaza. Any other recommendations nearby?\\nSounds great ......\\nTake a ride on the 7 train thread from a few years ago - https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k7919191-Take_a_Ride_on_the_7_train-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nIf you read post 156 on this Trip Report you\\'ll find out about more that you could fit in during a day in Queens ...\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k7998562-o150-Chapter_Three_They_adored_New_York_City-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nNote we were there in Winter so sunset at Gantry State Park was just after 4.30pm. I\\'d really recommend this, and you\\'ll have more time in the day to spend in Queens and see/do more again.\\nOh and the 7 train goes beyond Grand Central Terminal now. I remember going to the final Manhattan stop - Hudson Yards - 34th Street on a tour of NYC subway art with Darryl - http://nycsubwaytour.com/ - when it first opened and being impressed. That tour is great if you can fit it in.\\nHave a great time. You can eat very cheaply in NYC, its not as expensive as you are led to belive\\nPizza is cheap, Bagels are cheap, Chinese takeout , Halal guys are Cheap (All are NYC Staples)\\nAlso alot of ethnic food places are cheap. if you are in Jackson Heights, Food there is cheap too, in general food is cheap in Queens as long as it doesnt cater to tourists, which most places in Queens dont. First, really good job mapping your itinerary.\\nA few notes:\\nDay 3: The United Nations are a bit out of the way. You could do a half day where you do the United Nations and Roosevelt Island and it could be done on Day 7 after the MET. However, I would check, because I\\'m not sure if the United Nations is offering tours at the moment but the grounds can be seen from the street and they are nice.\\nDay 4: Don\\'t miss the Carousel next to the Brooklyn Bridge\\nDay 6: Pay a visit to the Fearless Girl\\nYou can eat for less without going strictly for junk food, an example is checking out restaurants that offer antipasto such as Il Trattoria dell\\'Arte or Cafe Fiorello. One thing that is expensive is the wine and beer.\\nEnjoy 8 days of hotel breakfast will get boring.... and getting to a diner, or a local bodega and ordering is what I find part of the NYC Experience. You can grab breakfast for $5 easily. (i never do hotel breakfasts).\\nOrdering a coffee in a bodega and trying to explain to someone that I don\\'t take milk or sugar gets some weird looks at times. Day 4: I’d definitely encourage you to continue beyond Dumbo…it’s atmospheric and has great views, but it’s also very touristy and won’t give you much of a feel for Brooklyn in all its diversity.\\nContinuing on to Prospect Park is a great idea; a natural itinerary would be to wander through Dumbo and then pick up the F train at York St, which will take you to the park’s Bartel Pritchard entrance (15th st stop). From the park, you have a number of options:\\n- wander north through the park to Grand Army Plaza, then head east on Eastern Parkway. This will take you past the Soldiers & Sailors Monument, the spectacular central branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden & the Brooklyn Museum, any/all of which are worth a stop. You’ll be in the neighborhoods of Prospect/Crown Heights, which have lots of inexpensive food options. Tom’s is good if you want a classic diner experience, or go for West Indian (Crown Heights has a big Caribbean community).\\n- wander through the park to the east and exit at Lincoln Rd or Parkside, then head south on Flatbush. This will put you in the heart of West Indian Flatbush, which is fun & lively to stroll and has a ton of inexpensive food. Try Trini doubles (w everything!) or roti or Jamaican patties or a big platter of jerk chicken with rice & peas. Yum! Walk farther south (past the ornate Kings Theatre), and the streets to the west will start to be lined with beautiful, enormous Victorian houses. Beverly Rd would be a good street to cut through on.\\nAlso close and accessible by bus/train (or, in the case of Green-Wood, a longish walk): Green-Wood Cemetery and Sunset Park Chinatown. The latter, centered on 8th Av from the 40s to the low 60s, is the city’s largest and a great opportunity for cultural immersion & fantastic eating.\\nIf you’re ambitious and have the time, you could also continue from any of these areas to Coney Island/Brighton Beach via the B (only goes as far as Brighton Beach), Q, D, N or F. All but the N will give you birds eye views of South Brooklyn neighborhoods.\\nHappy exploring! Great job of grouping.\\nI would leave the United Nations on Day 3, it\\'s only a short walk from Grand Central.\\nI do agree, maybe Roosevelt Island on Day 7. The tram is fun and gives great views, plus you can check out Four Freedoms Park. The park is closed on Tuesdays though.\\nOne question, on your arrival day, what are you doing with your luggage before going to Central Park? I would drop if off at your hotel and let them hold it until you check in, later in the day. Nothing wrong with Hotel Breaksfast, Saving money is good\\n( I see your iternary is mostly free things, Nothing wrong with that, lots of free and cheap things to do\\nthe NY Public library and Grand Central are Free too\\nInstead of Central park a second time, Id recommend Riverside Park , Fort Tryon park (Beautiful park with views of he Palisades and the GW Bridge) or Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx >>>You can eat very cheaply in NYC, its not as expensive as you are led to belive\\nPizza is cheap, Bagels are cheap, Chinese takeout , Halal guys are Cheap (All are NYC Staples)\\nAlso alot of ethnic food places are cheap<<<\\nI agree with this, look for the places where you order at the counter usually they’re less expensive, not to say that you cant get a good table serviced meal inexpensively. Some of the most delicious ous food has been at the of hole in the wall places . If you’re picking a place on the fly, there are menus posted out front usually, which really helps.\\n.The Irish pub is always a good standby, they’re not all in expensive though, there are many that have really good food however.\\nEdited: 11:27 am, August 26, 2021 So I did a little searching for a cheap eat list that I know I used the very first time I went to York city , but I can’t find it but I did find this one that I will attach.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g60763-zfp16-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nDouble check the prices and if they are still open since covid 19 for yourself— these lists are not perfect.\\nI can vouch for Szechuan Hot pot, los tacos number one, Faiccos Pork Store, John’s Bleecker Street pizza, Carmines pizza, the donut plant LES.\\nI’ve actually been to quite a few on there. I’ve been to more than I’m listing. The United Nations tours are suspended at the moment.\\nIf you do want a drink, you can search for happy hour specials Yay, I’m coming back to NY! This native hasn’t been there in 2 yrs and I sooo miss it. I’m coming in to host a very casual family get-together of 8-10 adults. This group of Italians is always happy with pizza, so I’m looking for a place that has any kind of separate space for us. We are coming in from CA, TX, CN, LI and NYC so any location is an option. Just somewhere where we can order a bunch of pizzas and wine and visit for a few hours. Date is either Fri-Sat, Oct 15-16. Does anyone know of a pizza place with a room we can book? Grazie mille! I would try one of the Serafina locations. They have a liquor license https://www.serafinarestaurant.com/ I have hosted many a party at V&Ts.\\nhttps://vtrestaurantpizzeria.com/ Most places I looked at want more than 10 people to book a private room. I think you may have a problem , especially for a fri or Sat. I hope I”m wrong. Maybe lunch might work. Fornino at Brooklyn Bridge Park is one place I checked. Trattoria Dell \\'Arte has a great small room and great thin crust pizza but they,re closed. Many thanks, I will look into both options tomorrow. Going on 9 years since I\\'ve been at the open, but noted Jon Werthiem\\'s always excellent spectator guide on the Sports Illustrated website and he had a link to another similar article by PJ Simmons that has a LOT of information on tickets\\nLots of great information in these\\nhttps://www.si.com/tennis/2021/08/26/us-open-2021-insider-tips-flushing-meadows\\nhttps://www.roadto45tennis.com/a-serious-tennis-fans-tips-for-the-us-open-tickets-more/\\nI want to get back to the open some day. I will live vicriously through those of you that get to go this year. Have fun. If you want cheaper food, there is Tommy\\'s Doghouse on the circle at the bottom of the ramp from the boardwalk. There are hotdogs, and larger models called \"sausages.\" There are also ice cream bars and various chips.\\nEn route, unless they have done something recently, the boardwalk from the Mets/Willets Point Blvd. #7 station is extremely uneven and frankly dangerous---use caution. Is it true, Manhattan is very dangerous to visit right now? I keep hearing the crime went way high and there is a good amount of aggressive homeless? Hustlers and drug dealers? Keep in mind, I have never been to Manhattan. It\\'s like any major city. There is crime, but the chances are that you won\\'t experience it.\\nRemember the media only reports the bad stuff they want to, they won\\'t report that millions of people have gone around their daily life with no issues.\\nYour profile doesn\\'t say where you live, do you live in a big city, a small town, a village in the countryside??\\nWhat is your experience of big cities (not just Manhattan).? OP\\'s posting history is telling. Lots of threads about this. Where do you live? Is it safe there? Yeah, I should add that staying in a train station overnight is less safe than staying in a hotel. **Keep in mind, I have never been to Manhattan.**\\nI can tell! Anthony, to be a credible poster you need to add your home area to your profile, so it shows. Your planned travel \"style\" seems a bit odd, like spending twelve hours to see Manhattan for the first time. Where are you sleeping and showering. Sure, Manhattan is expensive, but there are hostels and YMCAs, for example.\\nYou have not done enough research. Right now, during Covid-time, you may find night time Times Square to be idle and boring (except maybe for the lights and signs.) You need to plan much better than making random posts about abstract fears. What is your itinerary, what is your budget, what is your travel background? It is about as dangerous as any place in the world. Do your research ahead of time instead of posting random posts where you change your mind like a toddler every couple of days. Fill out your profile and think about asking intelligent, thoughtful questions. I personally roll a howtizer with me everywhere I go in NYC, Nobody ever bothers me, especially when I am walking my Doberman Pincher I travel solo to New York, and just did last weekend, I never felt unsafe, but then again, I would not sleep in a train station. Why is anyone still falling for this guy who also asked if it was safe to walk across the border to a strip club in Tijuana? Why is anyone taking him seriously?\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g150776-i761-k13292406-Walking_from_Tijuana_border_on_foot_safe-Tijuana_Baja_California.html\\nWould anyone like to buy my CDs?\\nWould anyone like to give me their banking info so I can wire them their winnings from their lost account in Zimbabwe? I decided to start my trip report while still at the Montreal airport. Everything went smoothly so far. I filed my proof of covid when doing my online check in and I finally got to use my Global Entry card so border check done by the US in Montreal went well and was quick.\\nMy flight started boarding so I will be in New York in less than 2 hours.\\nI am very excited to be on my way I\\'m excited for you, and hope you have a good trip. Bon voyage! It will be interesting to get a report from a regular visitor as to how the city has changed. Ditto on #2\\nIts hard for us locals to sometimes give an unbiased report on the city as its changed, a regular who knows the city but hasn\\'t been here since before covid can give a much better report Yay! No one booked and cancelled more trips than you did trying to get to NYC! Well earned, well played! Going to be such an exciting trip report! And the lives ones are always so exciting. Can’t wait! Left a few minutes late because we were waiting on passengers connecting from another flight.\\nFinally landed and I admit to getting a little emotional when I saw the skyscrapers from the air.\\nSo far not much to report other than there is still as much traffic.\\nWill report back later.\\nVery happy to finally be IN New York City How long are you here for? Seems this weekend is going to have some bad weather from Hurricane Henri (Its not going to touch the city, but might be some rain and rough waves) If you are in the E Vil on Sat......\\n6. Free Van Leeuwen Ice Cream\\nOn Saturday, August 21, from 2 to 5pm, grab a free scoop of Van Leeuwen ice cream in honor of the grand opening for self-storage startup Stuf’s East Village location, located at East 3rd St & Avenue A. Stuf will be providing tours of its new location and passersby will also have a chance to win a brand new YETI cooler. Howard: I am here until Sunday lunch, I did see that there might be rain, so I have my umbrella and a few things to do inside\\nTer: Thanks for the info, on Saturday I am starting my day at Sur La Table close to Columbus Circle and walking my way down with many stops, I guess I will have to pay for ice cream 😁\\nSo for the first time, my room was ready. I unpacked and am now on my way out to find my first slice of New York pizza in a year and 10 months and see a few other things that I will report back on later. I miss live trip reports, excellent.\\nEnjoy that slice and the rest of your trip. Welcome to NYC. Did you have any issues at the border? Per my understanding, regular Canadians are still not allowed to enter US. Hello, I am visiting New York next May 2022 with a friend. This is the second time I’ve been but this time I’m going for a week (instead of 3 days like last time).\\nAlthough I have been once before, it was in December and with older family members. This time it is in much different circumstances and with a friend (we will be 26&25).\\nSo I would love to know what people think is “Need to know information” before visiting NYC!? what did you wish you knew before going? Tips, tricks and inside info appreciated :-) Do your best to learn the subway and buses. I find Citymapper app for my phone indispensable.Pick your hotel wisely, By researching the things you want to do in relation to your hotel choices.\\nWhere did you stay last time?\\nDowntown (South of 23rd St. or even better IMO south of 14th St).is probably best for people your age ,you could base yourself there.\\nThe east village has lots of bars And restaurants and young people in their 20s. As does Greenwich Village but In my opinion, The Village is more expensive to do everything ,eat drink etc.\\nThe lower East side Has a lively night life with the same But, it can be very much a drunken mess sometimes in the evening. That’s my opinion.\\nChinatown is a fun place to explore and there’s lots of good Chinese restaurants at low cost. The west village should also be explored .Tribeca Has lots of restaurants although I think it’s more expensive there. Soho Has good shopping.. The flatiron district should also be explored ,if you haven’t already.\\nI would explore comedy clubs as well.\\nTips\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k8949287-Tips_Hints_and_Suggestions_for_First_Timers_to_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html -Utilize the subway. It\\'s the best way to get around.\\n-Purchase an unlimited 7 day Metrocard.\\n-Don\\'t necessarily plan every hour of the day. Leave time to roam the city and experience what it offers.\\n-NY\\'ers are very helpful. Ask if you are unsure.\\n-Google \"What to do in NYC this week/end\" prior to your trip. There may be events taking place that you may not know about.\\n-Subway etiquette....stand to the side when the train pulls in. Let the people get off first.\\n-If taking an escalator, stand to the right if not walking up/down.\\n-You don\\'t have to spend loads of $ on meals. There is everything from $.99 pizza to $250+ vegetarian.\\n-Don\\'t necessarily go for a hotel w/breakfast. You can get(as an example) an egg/cheese/tomato/bagel and an OJ at loads of places.\\n-Locals will seem as if we are always in a rush. We are. But we will stop and help.\\n-Please understand that tipping is a thing here. Bars. Restaurants. Cabs. Hotels. Etc. Please budget that into your trip.\\nJust a few.\\nI also tell this to many people who visit NYC...or any other city in the world:\\nPut down your cell phones for a day(or more.) Just go out and experience the sights, sounds and smells and not be drawn into mapping every route or posting every pic. I would purchase a hard copy guidebook or get one out of the library. It can be a good source of info not only for the normal tourist attractions but also out of the norm things. I would shore this with your friend & each of you make a list of your personal must dos & sees & then share the lists with one another to ensure that each of you are on the same page regarding what to do. I suppose you could do this on the computer but people tend to search only for things they are familiar with & a hard copy guidebook will open your possibilities IMNSHO.\\nEdited: 1:09 pm, August 24, 2021 -Hailing a taxi? Make sure the light on top of the vehicle are on.\\n-Bodegas and drug stores are great for picking up snacks/items for your hotel room.\\n-Some stores offer discounts for visitors. Just ask.\\n-Check the weather a few days prior to your trip. May weather can one glorious one week and chilly the next.\\n-Do try to explore outside of Manhattan. There are great neighborhoods and attractions in the other 4 boroughs(Brooklyn, The Bronx, Staten Island and Queens.)\\n-ATM\\'s are everywhere. You don\\'t need to carry a lot of cash.\\nJust some more. Definitely get a guide book and start picking out places/attractions/things to do. Create a flexible itinerary. You don\\'t have to have 7 days worth of plans. Leave a day open to check out an area without and schedule.\\nStop in a local restaurant for lunch. Check out some shops/boutiques. Have a drink at a local bar. Other than things specific to your tastes for how to spend your time I don\\'t there\\'s really anything someone from South Hampton, so presumably been to London plenty, really \\'needs\\' to know. Especially given that you\\'ve been there before.\\nEdited: 2:42 pm, August 24, 2021 .....maybe the fact that converting currency and bring hard cash isn\\'t a good idea if your one of the people who still thinks you should do that. Check out sites such as untapped cities and secret nyc to find different things to see\\nFor restaurants, I suggest making reservations, it\\'s always better to make sure you can get in rather than wait in line for an hour\\nI use Google Maps to map out the places I want to see and do, I set it to walking and triple the time mentioned to take into consideration that I will be slowed down by foot traffic or interested in a shiny thing a in window. Try to map your days based on areas, you do not want to be crisscrossing the city.\\nI do like the suggestion made by Ter to make sure the light on the cab is on when you hail it, however, as a tourist, I can honestly say that the light, during the day, is very hard to discern, so just hail away 😁\\nBefore you leave, check with your bank if your debit and credit cards will work in New York and if you have to advise, in advance, that you will be using them outside your own country.\\nI travel to New York city often as a solo female, I know you will be with a friend, but be aware of your surroundings, New York is not a scary city at all, but like any big city, listen to your inner voice, don\\'t walk around with your purse opened on your back and if you need directions, please ask, I have never had anyone not help me whether on the street or on the subway. Thank you all for your replies and suggestions! very helpful :-)\\nEdited: 4:58 pm, August 24, 2021 One thing to add. In NYC there is daily housekeeping in your hotel room so a daily tip of around $5.00 for two people would be welcome. Leave the cash in a prominent place such as on the bed (not under the covers) so the housekeeper will see it. You can leave a note with it if you like (I don\\'t do this, the cash is understood by the housekeeper and always taken). Please leave the tip daily because the housekeeper may be different every day.\\nIn regards to things to do, May is usually the start to warmer weather and a great time to be outside. Street fairs become a thing with many neighbourhoods having outdoor stalls and food and music. It\\'s too early for May 2022 listed events, but do a search for street fairs sometime early next year.\\nOther things you might like are the Smorgasburg weekly food events. They start in May outdoors and end in the colder months indoors. There are a couple of locations, one in Williamsburg Brooklyn (the original location), one in Prospect Park Brooklyn, and a smaller one in Lower Manhattan. The Williamsburg one is great for views back over to the skyline of Manhattan.\\nhttps://www.smorgasburg.com/ Through 9/30. Locations in all 5 boroughs.

I had totally forgotten about the Cow Parade until now. I\\'ve been to a couple cities other than NYC when it was happening and it definitely adds a little something to walking around. Will be there Sept 19-26, Love a good sunset with a cocktail in hand...any suggestions? I believe The View in Battery Park would be a great place to watch the sunset with a view of the Statue of Liberty that lights up. Get a bottle of wine, a beach towel, and sit in Wagner Park and watch the boats go by while the sun sets.\\nLoopy Doopy Rooftop Bar at the Conrad Hotel.\\nPJ Clarke at Brookfield.\\nCity Vineyard on West Street.

Don\\'t know if they are keeping their spaces or will let them go. They had been trying all sorts of things to keep going. Closing some outlets but keeping others open with limited hours; closing some places temporarily for a month here or there, offering special deals on some things. I assumed this had to do with people still not returning to offices, but I suppose could also be something like their employees getting infected. Odd. Not mentioned on their US website. https://www.pret.com/en-US\\nEdited: 1:40 am, August 10, 2021 There are always better sandwiches than Pret.\\nAlso, they stopped being called Pret-A-Manger about 4 years ago... just Pret now..\\nstill overpriced, underfilled sandwiches.\\nM Loved them when we visited London 15 years ago\\nUsed them when there was nothing else when we would be hungry near the US options Re #2 You must be an American big eater.When they first opened here 15 or 20 yrs ago they didn\\'t do well because a lot of Americans didn\\'t like their type of skinny English sandwich. So they shut everything down,went back to the drawing board and returned with bigger,spicier sandwiches that must have been a success because they had expanded a lot recently. I liked that you could buy a half a sandwich, though I recently struggled to find something that wasn\\'t so spicy it gave me heartburn (they unfortunately didn\\'t disclose all ingredients on their labels). Though I didn\\'t like their coffee,what I did like was mini brownies they sold for a dollar or two that were only a couple of bites but could really hit the spot if you were stuck by a sweet tooth craving while walking around midtown. Actually, I was looking for one of these when I came upon this closed Pret on Lexington Av across from GCT the other day. At first I just thought I\\'d missed their 3 or 4 pm closing, but then saw the notice (undated) about the total closing. The only other place with something like that mini brownie in midtown was the Eli\\'s in the GCT market, which has finally reopened, but is a mere shadow if its former self and not offering that product (and many other products) anymore. I actually like picking up a sandwich at Prêt à Manger. I also remember going to Pax (are there still any around?). What would be the other options? I rather like Pret a Manger. Sort of a safe bet where I always could find something for a \"grab and go\" breakfast, lunch or snack. Particularly when on the move near a nice park for a quick rest my legs. @#4 - I\\'m British, but I just like to have a sandwich with a bit more filling.\\nIt\\'s 90% Bread and 10% filling, and we all know bread ain\\'t good for you.\\nM\\nP.S - Please use the enter key to make your posts more readable. Pre-pandemic, it also had locations in Boston and Washington DC at least. It looks like Google still shows one location open inside something else at the University of Chicago, but idk if that\\'s up to date. #5 Pax is gone, though someone else with similar operation seems to be in their shops in my area (where there was one next to Westin Grand Central on 42d St & another on Lex in low 50s). Whether they just changed the name or sold to someone else, I don\\'t know. I\\'m not a huge sandwich eater, so I don\\'t really stay on top of these things. While there are a lot of individual delis around for sandwiches, I can\\'t think off the top of my head think of other chain operations.\\nIf you like the type of sandwiches at Pain Quotidien, note a few of their branches remain open following their bankruptcy, and since the company that acquired some of their assets also acquired some of bankrupt Maison Kayser\\'s remains, some Maison Kayser branches are now PQs. All Maison Kayser\\'s generally pretty nice fixtures remain, but with PQ food. Two locations that come to mind are the former Maison Kaysers on SE corner of 44th & 3d, as well as one on SW corner of Lex and either 40th or 41st. I don\\'t know about other locations (other than Maison Kayser on Lex in low 50s remains closed and has not reopened as anything).\\nEdited: 1:24 pm, August 10, 2021 Yes, it is true, overpriced, underfilled sandwiches My daughter and husband live in Chelsea in a very small apartment. The rest of the family (4 adults and a 2 year old) plan to visit over Thanksgiving. We have booked hotel rooms for the rest of the family, but would love to be able to rent a house for the Wed-Sat of Thanksgiving week (2021) so we can cook our traditional dinner and be together as a family. I know that Airbnbs are allowed in NYC. Any suggestion as to close in locations we we might look for a 3 bedroom home/apartment that we could take public transportation to mid-town Manhattan. I\\'m just not familiar enough with the geography/transportation to begin a search.\\nThanks for your help Airbnb\\'s are mostly illegal in Manhattan. The Marmara Hotel upper east side has some 3 bedroom 3 bathroom Apts with full kitchens. There,s a house in Long Island a city or Astoria that was used by some orepamdemic. I\\'ll try to find some info. I don\\'t think that house is listed any longer but in searching I was reminded the Beekman Towers Hotel has a 4 bedroom 4 bath penthouse but I son\\'t see it listed on their website.\\nhttps://thebeekmantowerny.com/ There was a recent post here from someone looking for hotels/apt hotels with full kitchens (that is, including a stove with an oven). You might try to find that thread. Most locals live in small spaces, Im not going to say 3 Bedroom with a full kitchen doesnt exist short term rentals dont exits, they do, butr they are rare and they are probably going to severly cost you. We are most willing to be in New Jersey or Long Island. Someplace commuting distance. Suggestions? I suggest you make a reservation for dinner and enjoy each other\\'s company. Doing the shopping and prep time is a real waste of time in NYC. What do your husband and child think. Have you asked them? There’s a company that rents event spaces of all sizes, even small places for small events. I know I have the business card for it somewhere. If renting a spec unit or small apartment just for your cooking and eating is of interest, I can try and find out more - I know who introduced me to them so o can ask her if you want. What’s wrong with the 3 or 4 bedroom Apts. mentioned above? If you go to NJ or Long Island you will likely need a car. Not to mention the fact that it may not be that easy to rent a house in NJ or on Long Island for 4 nights. I\\'m visiting NYC at the weekend with a friend that hasnt been vaccinated (health issues), just wondering, with the proof of vax card are you able to go in Starbucks/pret type places to get coffee etc to go and if you\\'re dining outside at a pub/restaurant are you able to go inside to use the bathroom? (Long day otherwise :) is it only sitting to eat where you have to show the card, or going inside at all?\\nThanks My (current) understanding is that you can both fetch takeout and use the restrooms (at the discretion of the business) https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page\\nYou both will need masks for riding transit etc.\\nIf your friend is medically vulnerable hopefully they have consulted their doctor Just went into Starbucks, anyone was able to enter and pick up with no checks; every single person inside was masked. Also noteworthy: their restroom was closed to the public. Other than masks and no bathrooms, it was a normal Starbucks experience.\\nDifferent restaurants will have their own precautions, but in general it seems that outdoor diners can go in to use restrooms but will be required to mask up to do so. Some places may require temp checks just to enter. Thank you. I live in Connecticut and it\\'s a case of masks everywhere even if vaccinated, so I\\'m used to wearing them all the time when out and about :).\\nMy friend had a reaction to a previous vaccine so cant get this one, but isnt immune compromised, so should be ok without a doctors visit (I hope).\\nBuzzing to get back to NYC - havent been since 2019, love it there! If your friend is agreeable, I might suggest getting a Covid test ASAP. That way, she can show proof that she is not currently infectious. Yeah, I\\'ll give that a go. Mask & negative test have got to count for something :) I went to Maman, a bakery, last weekend. They have pickup, outside seating and inside seating. Anyone who mentioned that they wanted to sit inside had to show proof of vaccination with a card with their picture to prove who they are.\\nI also went to a restaurant on Saturday night that asked for proof of vaccination.\\nAs I am Canadian I do not have an app from New York State, however, I did have the proof of vaccination on a document in my phone and that was sufficient. They however did not ask my friend for her proof of vaccination. In my still-limited experience, specific policies vary across establishments. I have not been asked for a vax card at typical take-out places (and at some sit-down places that really should have asked); at one beer-garden type place we ordered & used the bathroom inside, but were served outside, without being asked to show our vax cards; at another, a bouncer was posted outside checking & and my SIL (who’s vaccinated but whose phone had died & consequently couldn’t show proof) was unable to enter at all. At the other extreme, I’ve seen one place that appears to be openly defying the law (big sign out front saying they don’t “discriminate” based on vaccination status)…we’ll see how long that lasts!\\nWhile getting a Covid test is a great idea, I don’t think it’s a substitute for proof of vaccination - either statutorily or in practice. Even if you have been vaccinated, you sometimes need to get a current Covid test - at least I needed to get one for a medical procedure last week. At another doctor\\'s office appointment the day before my procedure, I had to wait to get the Covid results verified as the test was done by the hospital who did the procedure & they didn\\'t give me a proof of test.\\nAs for recommending the Covid test to the OP, I\\'ve heard many places will accept proof of recent (within 10 days) of negative test as proof that you\\'re not infected. I don\\'t see any exceptions for tests in the NYC rules (link in #1 above). Perhaps the state rules are different\\nAlso I meant your friend should have communications with their doctor about the risks/benefits whether or not they are traveling I am flying to NYC for spinal cord surgery. I will be traveling with my elderly mother and will barely be able to walk - I will have a walker. A couple of questions.\\n1. When returning a car to JFK can we catch a cab at the car return? I have been on the AirTran and it is way to jerky for someone coming off spinal cord surgery.\\n2. How much walking is involved to get where the cab can get us?\\n3. Are cabs allowed to drop one off at the curbside at the airport? That is where I will have a wheelchair awaiting me.\\nThanks for your help! 1. So you are planning to rent a car? If yes, that is probably not an appropriate plan.\\nIs your hospital in Manhattan? Is your hotel nearby?\\n2 .I\\'m reasonably sure Yellow cabs are not supposed to pick up on-airport except at the terminal dispatcher lines. I think you could call a car service (Also not all rental agencies are on-airport at the Federal Circle Airtrain station)\\n3. Yes, cabs and car services can drop off passengers at the terminal curbs\\nIt\\'s sort of unclear what you really need\\nI can\\'t think of many situations in which having a rental car would be suitable\\nThe cost of renting and parking is rarely likely to be more economical than using cabs and car services - with physical limitation considerations renting a car is likely to be a big hassle NOT a convenience Thank you for your response to question #3. >>>I\\'m reasonably sure Yellow cabs are not supposed to pick up on-airport except at the terminal dispatcher lines. I think you could call a car service (Also not all rental agencies are on-airport at the Federal Circle Airtrain station)<<<\\nI agree with this by all accounts there’s no cabs there , you have to take the air train to the terminals.\\nSo you didn’t answer if your hospital is in Manhattan? I assume it is.\\nWhat I’ve done when I’m coming into The City with a rental car (hertz) is return it in Manhattan closest to my hotel, tour the city and then on departure take a cab Or car service to the airport.\\nCan you do that?\\nIt’s saved me from having to drive to the airport then the air train to get to the terminal. Why are you renting a car? I presume that you are not going to be doing a lot of sightseeing & your mom will not want to leave your hospital room except to sleep if you are spending a couple of days in the city. Driving in a busy city is a hassle & parking is expensive.\\nDitch the rental. When you get to JFK, wait on the official taxi line, get a cab from the official dispatcher at the end of the line &, if your hospital is in Manhattan. the cost will be $75 including tip. When you get out of the hospital, call a car service (Dial 7 or Carmel are the most mentioned here) to take you to the airport. Having gotten off a plane at jfk and needing a wheelchair (injured on last day of vacation), my experience was that you get to jump the cab line when you are wheeled up (some passengers may grumble, but that’s the practice).\\nI can’t speak to renting a car and how to return it at jfk specifically. But I can speak to parking in Manhattan. Even if you don’t care about costs, parking garages are not wheelchair friendly. It sounds like both you and your mom will experience walking challenges, and trying to get you both up parking ramps will be difficult and painful. Maybe your hotel and the hospital have valet services for cars, but that’s the only way I would do it. Otherwise, I would urge you to reconsider the rental plan and use the money for either a designated driver for your trip or plan on cabs and car service rather than your own rental. Returning it at the airport is the least of your challenges. (But if you insist, if it were me, I would call the rental car company directly and ask them what accommodations they can make for you. It doesn’t sound like a situation where you can rely on a bunch of volunteers on the internet to completely address your concerns). I agree with post 5.\\nAlthough, We can specifically answer the 3 questions you asked.\\nWhat your starting point is with your rental car\\nAND why you decided its best for you to rent one is your business , but if we knew that more options that could suit you could be offered.\\n@ 4 Personally I assumed by the way Sheena L (the OP) phrased their question “ Rental return at JFK” that they are not starting at JFK airport, but are indeed ending there. My hospital is not in Manhattan. It is on Long Island. I didn’t answer the question because the first responder was rude and I didn’t feel like engaging with them. Renting closer to where my hotel is a great suggestion. I will look into that and will make it much easier. Thank you for that. No one intends to be rude. The intent is to figure out what you need and answer to the best of knowledge - sometimes more info is what is needed to be able to do that. This is the NYC forum, not Long Island or New York State. It is a fair assumption on this forum that you are coming into one of the five boroughs.\\nGiven the physical condition that you have described yourself and your mom, it sounds like a driver is a more prudent option, unless you will be in New York for multiple days before your surgery and want the car for that reason. The roads have lots of traffic and construction. It’s not easy driving for someone who is in pain and unfamiliar. However, if you do want to rent and return at jfk, please consider calling the rental agency directly and arranging w them to provide proper and safe transport to your terminal. There’s a bit of a jungle mentality in this state and at jfk, so unless you’ve prearranged exactly what you need, you may find yourself faced w absurd challenges. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff has removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guidelines with regards to off-topic chat.

There are hundreds of restaurants in a 5 block radius.\\nEdited: 9:26 pm, August 24, 2021 Thank you! In terms of cuisine, pretty much anything. I’m thinking more casual for lunch. Price doesn’t matter, but not looking for anything too fancy just yet. I always like to get suggestions from locals and not just Yelp or TA ratings. Thanks again!

I\\'m schlepping a large suitcase and carry-on, was wondering if I should get a cab or take the AirTran and LIRR to Penn. Can you wrangle all that luggage by yourself?\\nIs your hotel near Penn Station?\\nI suspect a Yellow cab is likely a more appropriate choice https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/taxi-car-and-van-service\\nEdited: 8:28 am, August 23, 2021 Agree it depends on how well you can manage the luggage and where your hotel is located. Cab.\\nYour question provides your answer: schlepping a large bag plus a carry on? Why break yourself before you even arrive? Start your trip comfortably instead of waking up sore the next day. I agree with Risa, a cab is the way to go with a lot of luggage and it\\'s a flat rate from JFK to New York City.\\nI\\'ve taken the AirTrain and LIRR in the past but only had a backpack. Like the others, I would, and do, take a taxi. However, whichever method you take, you might see a fair amount of traffic. I was once coming in from the airport around 6-7 and encountered traffic so heavy it came to a halt in the midtown tunnel, whereupon guy behind us started honking madly, as if we had any control over it. I came very close to getting out of the taxi and asking him what I could do for him. Also note if you take LIRR you might have trouble finding a place for a large suitcase. Taxi is easier, plus it\\'s a fixed rate from anywhere in Manhattan. Sit back and enjoy the ride. I always do Lyft from JFK. Usually a bit less expensive than taxi. I just checked Lyft - it’s $127 from jfk to my address right now, with tip, that’s double the price of a cab.\\nPlease note that Lyft and Uber prices have increased significantly in the last year. for $127 take Public transportation.It will cost you about $20 It depends entirely on just how big your luggage is vs. how much you\\'re willing to spend. Hi!\\nWhat restaurants are best to view the ball drop / for the fireworks in Manhattan? I assume maybe ones near Times Square!\\nOr what do you suggest is best to do in NYC for New Years?\\nWe have been for Christmas before in 2019 from the UK so would love to do New Years too.\\nMany thanks! Xx There will be little or no outside dining in the middle of winter and even less with the ball drop. The closest thing I can think of is Bubba Gump\\'s where there is indoor dining & then they let you out for the ball drop. However, attendance is by lottery only & it\\'s very expensive. Any place with a view of the ball drop will cost mega bucks.\\nEdited: 5:35 pm, August 24, 2021 I hope there is outdoor dining through the winter again - I liked it! But views of the ball drop are not really realistic except as set forth above. Either you stand outside (if it’s allowed this year, which requires a big time commitment and a strong bladder) or pay big dollars. There’s no escaping it. The fireworks are in Central Park....and other locations around the city. You won\\'t really be able to see both(ball drop + fireworks.) You have to choose one. What was that hotel that had the restaurant with a terrace where they offered NYE TS viewing parties? Novotel?\\n(I think it closed - don\\'t know what, if anything, might have replaced it. Anybody have a clue?) ^\\nhttps://supernovaballdrop.com/features/questions-answers/\\nThat link may not be accurate/current.\\nEdited: 6:29 pm, August 24, 2021 Hi, Will be spending a week at the Manhattan Club near Central Park Sept 19-26. Flying in and out of JFK. Will be using public transportation during our stay. What is the best app for which subway lines to take, best exit platform and street level directions to what ever destination we are looking to get to at the moment. I\\'ll carry a subway map, but shortcuts not to waste time are always helpful. Thanks for your time I personally use the My MTA app. As for getting out of the subway, I always find it half the fun, as a tourist, to look around for a minute to see where I\\'m at and what\\'s around. Citymapper is the best in my opinion. Others ive traveled with prefer Google maps. I haven’t used Google Maps on the run.\\nBut I know from experience that\\nCItymapper will show you how to get out of the subway as well. It will even chime when Your stop approaches. And it will also tell you which subway car is the least crowded.\\nEdited: 12:57 pm, August 23, 2021 +1 here for using Citymapper app. Makes getting around so much easier! The official MTA site is a wealth of information:\\nhttps://new.mta.info I downloaded City Mapper and have been playing around with it and is seems perfect. Can\\'t wait to use it in person! Google maps, then City Mapper, then the MTA app for me.\\nI also think having a compass on your phone is very handy. Sometimes when exitting the subway you don\\'t have a sense of direction, but if you know you need to head north for example, the compass will help.\\nAnd if you like to use the public buses, I found the MTA Bus Time to be really good. It\\'s in real time and shows exactly where your next bus is on any route.\\nhttp://bustime.mta.info/ Citymapper and then Google Maps for me.\\nIf it\\'s the last bit walking directions, then Google Maps is superior, so sometimes I\\'ll plot CityMapper to the destination, which will show you which exit to take, but then switch to Google Maps as I\\'ve exited the subway station.\\nEven when I know where I\\'m going, I\\'ll use CityMapper as it does show an ETA.. great for when meeting people...\\nM Thank you all for your time and advise, much appreciated I used Citymapper 2 weeks ago on a NY trip.\\nAll I can say is OUTSTANDING!!!!\\nNot only was it helpful for times and lines but it even would show the best place to sit as well as which entrance/exit to take for the correct line.\\nHighly recommended! I am flying in to JFK on October 18 at 5pm and flying out of EWR at 6pm on October 19 (both are international flights if that makes a difference). I\\'ll essentially have one day in NYC, and I am looking for suggestions on where to stay for that night/day. It\\'s just me (40-something woman) and I will have bulky luggage with me (my bike in a bike bag plus a suitcase), so a hotel would be preferable (where I can leave my luggage after checkout). I don\\'t want to break the bank on accommodations, so maybe no more than $250 for the night. I\\'d like to stay in a neighbourhood that I can walk to get breakfast/lunch/dinner, etc., maybe do some shopping (an easy day if you will), with enough time to still get to EWR for my flight home. I\\'ve never been to NYC before, and most of the forum posts with long layovers are from pre-pandemic. Any suggestions that folks have are greatly appreciated! Midtown west would be a good choice. Do you have a personal sightseeing wish list?\\nIf yes, describing that that can help people advise which evening & morning activities you can manage and where is most convenient to stay\\nAssume with that volume of luggage you\\'ll be using cabs or car services for airport transport?\\nPossible evening activities (besides dinner) view from an observatory, ride on the Staten Island Ferry and/or a stroll through some interesting neighborhoods\\nEdited: 12:56 pm, August 24, 2021 Thanks very much for the replies! I don\\'t have a personal sightseeing wish list, mostly because of the short time frame I\\'ll have (I plan to come back to NYC another time to take in all the sights, at which point I\\'ll have a very long wish list *lol*). I definitely plan to use cabs to move between the airports; otherwise, I\\'m fine with public transit/walking/biking/etc. to get around in the city. Low key activities are what I\\'d be looking for, things I can walk to (even as you mention Kaye, strolling through interesting neighbourhoods), etc. This is what I would recommend\\nstart at Times Square and walk down 47th St to Rockefeller Center, Go to 30 Rock , which is Top of the Rock Observatorry, You can see the NYC Skyline , the Empire State Building and the World trade center. You should be able to see the Statue of Liberty in the Distance\\nNow walk up 5th Ave to Central Park and explore Central park, its about a 15 Min walk from 59th St to Betheda Fountain and the Bow Bridge.\\nIf you still have time, take Subway down to Battery Park and See the Statue of Liberty , NYC Skyline and the Brooklyn Bridge I\\'ll try to deal with travel and hotel. It\\'s a fixed fare from JFK to anywhere in Manhattan. Hopefully you\\'ll be able to manage (maybe with a cart on wheels) to get out to the taxi stand. There’s an official taxi line outside each terminal. Make sure you take a regular yellow nyc taxi and keep the receipt you\\'ll get from the dispatcher which will have the taxi number should you leave something behind one need to track that cab down. The fare is ~$52. With tolls and a tip for the driver it will be around $75. Your other option is to use a car service you can book in advance like\\nDial7.com\\nCarmellimo.com\\nbut I wouldn\\'t prepay in case they don’t show up. Then you can just take a taxi. Those services charge about the same as a taxi.\\nWhere to stay really depends on what you want to see. Assuming you want a taxi or car service to EWR (I would definitely use a car service for that trip to avoid last minute worry about finding a taxi when you need one) you can stay anywhere. Most airlines ask you to arrive 3 hrs. Before an international flight but I don’t know if that’s the same for a Canadian flight. That would mean arriving at 3 pm. If you allow an hour and a bit to travel, you don\\'t have a lot of time. Here are a few hotel ideas\\nThe Artezen in the financial district\\nPeople have been loving this relatively new hotel and it,s within your budget. It puts you near the Staten Island ferry for a free drive by of the Statue of Liberty , walking distance to the 9/11 Memorial, the One World Observatory and plenty of dining options. The Hilton Garden Inn a financial district also works but not as nice.\\nIf you prefer staying in midtown (the more typical first time location) it looks like the Courtyard Central Park and possibly the Residence Inn a Central Park, both in the same building MIGHT be in budget if you join TripAdvisor Plus which has a discount. Great location and great views from most rooms. If that isn,t within budget, M Social hotel is in the same general area and will be within budget and has various view options on their own website. Join the Millenium frequent guest program for perhaps lower prices and more benefits.\\nHope this helps.\\nEdited: 2:46 pm, August 24, 2021 One thing you do NOT need to worry about is finding food for breakfast lunch and dinner. Best to pick out your hotel, and then ask where to eat (budget, cuisine preferences help get more relevant responses). There is food everywhere, from coffee places with light, quick take out, to food carts, to bodega or sandwich type places, to casual restaurants, and high end (and high priced) cuisine. Many kitchens serve until 10 or later.\\nYou can do a \"highlights tour\" like Howard suggested, or pick a fun neighborhood, like SoHo or the East Village or something like that, and just walk, and walk, and walk. (That\\'s my kind of thing...I like to just sort of get lost). Or you can pick a world famous museum like the Met or MoMA and spend hours there....what\\'s your preference? Yeah, you\\'ll never go hungry here.\\nAs Risa mentioned, you could pick a neighborhood and explore. I also find just getting lost to be enjoyable.\\nThis site has so many great self guided walking tours, you could mix and match to your delight, enjoy:\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html Midtown West is the best option if you are planning on taking public transportation with your luggage, as Penn Station is the major transfer point between the trains to the two airports.\\nThe trains will save you a lot of money, but with that much luggage, you might just have to take taxis. In that case, I agree with others - anywhere in Manhattan south of Central Park would be a good choice.\\nEdited: 4:08 pm, August 24, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 2:15 am, August 25, 2021 and a 2:30 pm pickup on Thursday in Manhattan. Sorry, I know I\\'m overthinking it. First trip to NYC and both Dial7 and Carmel have questionable reviews lately. I\\'m inclined to gamble on Dial7 but don\\'t want to end up without a car (some reviews mentioned this).\\nAnybody with a recent experience with either one, that you think I should know about? Thanks! You are overthinking it.\\nYou an always catch a cab at LGA. I used Dial 7 for an 8am flight out of LGA on a Sunday morning in June. My home is in Suffolk County about 40 minutes, no traffic from LaGuardia. My car was scheduled for 4:20am, the driver arrived at 3:57am. The car was a late model Lexus LS. Driver drove courteously and had me at LGA at 4:40am. My company paid the fare, I believe it was $185 with tip. I\\'ve used them before and never had an issue.\\nEdited: 12:46 am, August 08, 2021 The company I worked for 7 years ago had a corporate account with Dial 7. I worked on Long Island but had all day meetings in midtown once a month. In 3 years, not one issue. Meetings were at 9:15am sharp, car would pick me up around 7:15am. Always on time. Seriously, why not just walk out the door and get a cab? The taxi stand is usually right outside every terminal.\\nDiane\\nNYC Photo Safari I would get a cab from LGA.\\nI tend to use Carmel more than Dial 7. I had a really bad experience w Dial 7 when I was going to my nephew’s wedding in NJ. They were over an hour late, it was a bad traffic day (the day before thanksgiving) and I was late to the weddings\\nWhich causes a kerfluffle in families. So I would never use them again myself. But I recognize that it’s a one time experience, they’ve been in business for decades, and for every bad experience there are probably 100 good ones. We regularly use Carmel for many years to go to/from all the airports (from our home in Manhattan); always found them to be dependable and reasonably priced. We do book a couple of days in advance for airport, since sometimes they don’t have cars available at the last minute.\\nwww.CarmelLimo.com I would just get a taxi too, though in a previous life one of my employers used Dial for the late night rides home, airport trips, etc and I never had any complaints. Of course, I suppose they might have more incentive to please in corporate situations as they don\\'t want to lose any of those accounts. I\\'ve used Carmel many times. but from JFK. My experience has been flawless each and every time I\\'ve used them. For a pick up at LGA you must meet car services at the designated area adjacent to the terminal (curbside pick ups not allowed) https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides\\nBooking a car service for the trip to the airport can be a convenience I would check carefully the terminal you arrive in and where you get car service vs cab. Things are really in flux there these days. 9am on Sunday should be relatively quiet and I would think a cab might be the easiest given the car pick up situation....but again check it out. We are a large group of 10 (5 adults, 5 kids) and we\\'ll be spending 2 full days in NYC around Thanksgiving. Right now we are thinking of driving from D.C. to Jersey City on Thanksgiving night. Then spending Friday and Saturday in NYC, leaving Jersey City back to D.C. early Sunday morning. Will this be a nightmare traffic Wise? Willing to get on the road by 4 or 5am. Also, any tips on best place for a group like ours to stay? Thinking either Jersey City, or Manhattan. Traffic is always a concern here, but Thanksgiving week is one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.\\nStay in Manhattan, in a hotel, far better. Yes. There will be a lot of traffic. Won’t there be traffic just leaving the DC area?\\nThis is nothing new: I remember sitting in traffic as a child, driving from our home in NJ to my cousins in Long Island. Bumper to bumper the whole trip. And going back to college on the Sunday after (near Boston), one long traffic nightmare the whole way. It tends to be the busiest weekend of the year.\\nBut if you prepare for it, it could be fun anyhow. I think \"Embassy Suites by Hilton New York Manhattan Times Square\" maybe good. They have family rooms and are close to the Parade route. In addition they have free breakfast (a time and money saver with 10 people) Also, if The BEAST Speedboat Ride is running it maybe a good & fast way to see the Statue of Liberty. In addition, I would recommend a lunch at Central Park Boat House if you get a chance (probably make a reservation).\\nWhatever you do, I hope you all enjoy your stay.\\nEdited: 9:46 pm, August 23, 2021 Another food tip- Serafina is one spot that has heat lamps and outside dining in case you want to sit somewhere with wait service that can take a large party. They also have pizza on the menu, so that is always a plus for me. Also, if there are Pizza fans in your group there is an Artichoke pizza around the corner from Embassy Suites and there is a John\\'s Pizza on 39th & Broadway both would probably deliver to the hotel, or you could go pick it up a pie or a slice.\\nEdited: 10:35 pm, August 23, 2021 Thank you. We are just visiting DC, and Annapolis,(coming from Neb. to spend Thanksgiving with our son) so we are unfamiliar with the traffic. Trying to plan an itinerary where we don\\'t get stuck in traffic too terribly (if it\\'s possible). We don\\'t mind driving at off hours. We do have to have him back to Annapolis by Sunday evening though, he is a mid at USNA, other wise we\\'d love to stay in Manhattan longer. The one thing that I can predict about traffic is that it is unpredictable. First, if you don’t already have a gps app line WAZE, get one. Second, make the decision whether you want to try to “beat” traffic or enjoy your trip and worry about it when it happens. For some, getting up at 5am is worth it. For me, that’s terribly unappealing. I would rather maximize the enjoyment of the time you have, and figure that your five hour driving trip is at least two hours longer. Discuss it with your family and decide how to play it. But there’s no magic trick to avoiding traffic on thanksgiving weekend. You will have traffic intermittently your entire route between NY/NJ to Annapolis unless you drive between 1 and 6am (Plan on public transportation between Jersey city and Manhattan, though).\\nEdited: 11:46 pm, August 23, 2021 Thank you so much. Figuring in a couple of extra drive time hours will atleast help us be mentally prepared for that. Yes, we plan to take PATH into Manhattan from NJ...from other forums I\\'ve read, seams like it\\'d be best to park and ride. We\\'ll also be in a big 12 passenger van. Just got WAZE. I\\'ve always just used Google maps, which can be goofy at times- so appreciate the tips!\\nEdited: 6:32 am, August 24, 2021 Is the vehicle your personal vehicle or a rental?\\nLarge vehicles, such as a 12 passenger van, can be more challenging to park (height/size limitations and/or oversize surcharges) so parking outside of Manhattan is likely best\\nD.C. has good public transit so your need to drive and pay for parking may be limited (or non-existent) during your visit. https://www.wmata.com/\\nYou can get to Annapolis that way too https://www.annapolis.gov/364/Regional-Travel\\nAnother option to consider, since you have to return to Annapolis, is taking the Amtrak train instead. IIRC New Carrollton is the closest Amtrak station to Annapolis.\\nAmtrak requires reservations and tickets are cheaper if purchased at least a couple of weeks in advance.\\nFor your group, the train might not be cheaper than the cost of driving & parking but it will be less stressful and perhaps a novel experience, especially for the kids Driving to/in Jersey City can be worse than driving in Manhattan. Plus, you need to plan for parking .\\nAre you considering a hotel in Jersey City or a rental?\\nRentals in Jersey City used to be very attractive to many, if they were walkable to the PATH, but before the pandemic, some changes were made to short term rentals:\\nhttps://p1cdn4static.civiclive.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_6189660/Image/City%20Hall/Housing%20Economic%20Development/HousingPreservation/FAQ%20-%2012-4-19.pdf I used to live in Washington DC, with family in NJ and friends in NYC, so I did this drive over long weekends often.\\nTraffic will be horrendous Wednesday night, among the worst of the year. It will also be quite bad Thursday night, as people doing daytrips for Thanksgiving drive home, but not as bad as Wednesday night. But Thursday night heading into NYC will be quite rough, as many NYC residents are coming home from visiting family in NJ or CT for the day. If you want to avoid the worst of the traffic, try timing your drive for Thursday late morning/early afternoon, when most people will be spending time with their families. Of course, this doesn\\'t work if you actually have Thanksgiving plans.\\nTraffic on the I-95 corridor is terrible on Sundays, even not on holidays, and it\\'s hard to avoid, though generally, afternoons and evenings are the worst.\\nEdited: 10:41 am, August 24, 2021 Heading down from the capital on Thursday (8/26) to see Van Gough and Liberty. I saw on the NPS website that backpacks, drinks (even water) are not allowed in monument. What do folks with such items do with them while visiting the Statue? I usually carry around a couple camera\\'s and bottled water (its gonna be HOT) in a small backpack. There are lockers.\\nhttps://www.nps.gov/stli/planyourvisit/visiting-the-pedestal.htm\\n\"Lockers are located near the secondary screening building and require a 25¢ deposit (quarters only). Locker Size is approximately 12\"x 12\"x 18\" and there are change machines available for $1 and $5 bills.\" There are lockers at the secondary security screening entrance to the monument https://www.nps.gov/stli/planyourvisit/safety.htm I missed that part! Thanks! https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/st-george/\\nStarting on Monday August 23rd, the new ferry route will go from Midtown West (W39th St/Pier 79) to Staten Island (St George) with a stop at Battery Park City (Vesey St). The total trip will be around 30 minutes.\\nAt the Midtown West stop, riders can access a network of free connecting buses that will give them further access into Manhattan.\\nThe fare will be $2.75 per ride, the same as the other NYC ferry routes, and will be an addition to the current great NYC Ferry routes running on the east side of Manhattan, and will complete the ferry access to all five boroughs. The ferries are new, sleek, modern, air conditioned and comfortable.\\nI\\'m not sure if there is a new pier on Staten Island for this new route or whether the existing pier will be shared with the current free ferry.\\nAnd it looks like the ferry will get closer to the SOL than the existing free Staten Island ferry which will be good for tourists who may want a closer view of the statue even though it\\'s just a sail by. It\\'s another option.\\nAlso starting sometime this year is a new Coney Island ferry route, going from Pier 11/Wall St to Coney Island in 37 minutes with a stop at Bay Ridge.\\nhttps://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/route/coney-island-route/ A visitor could make a day of it with this new ferry.\\nStarting at the southern end of the High line, they could walk the High Line right up to 34th St, go and see the Vessel and Hudson Yards, then walk across to the pier at 39th St to take the ferry down to Staten Island. Or possibly take the new connecting bus route will take them to the pier but I can’t find any info about the connecting bus. What a great idea.. thanks for posting the info Aynat. Great alternative to see SOL or even just go downtown, especially when it’s hot and sticky. Thanks for posting & letting us know.\\nEdited: 4:44 pm, August 19, 2021 Thanks. I thought it was a great idea when I saw it, and thought others might too. I loved the ferries on the East River and down to the Rockaways, this one will be another one to try out.\\nFor visitors in particular, it will be another SOL viewing option. Great info I will look forward to this for sure! Thank you for the info! Do we know when the coney island Ferry will start? The website says that it\\'s launching in 2021. Hopefully it will be before the end of October because Coney island shuts down around Halloween for the winter. It would still be good to take the ferry there after that though and just walk the boardwalk and have a hot dog or go to the aquarium. This sounds great!\\nYou could turn it into a day as well by heading south to Battery Park City. Maybe start early on the High Line and team it up with a visit to the Whitney and/or Little Island. Continue south through the Village and Tribeca, stopping for lunch somewhere and then heading to Battery Park City to catch the ferry.\\nI love that it is a city ferry, not a sightseeing one, so it’s $2.75 instead $20 to $30 or more, for essentially the same trip. And it runs late into the evening as well, which can make for some dramatic skyline views.\\nAwesome. Thanks, Aynat! :)\\nP.s. The shuttle bus link on the NYC Ferry page takes you to this page by NY Waterways https://www.nywaterway.com/busstopsschedules.aspx I\\'m glad that I don\\'t pay the New York taxes that will go toward making up for the ridiculously low fares on this.\\nAynat, tell us about the fares on Sydney\\'s ferries. My understanding is they are building a new dock on the bay side of CI at Kaiser Park - about a mile from the amusement park\\nThe ferries were (theoretically) a new commuting option. However they are of marginal utility for those who are not within walking distance of a dock on both ends of their commute. For a working commuter who still needs a bus or subway it doubles the cost of the commute. (They are not part of the Metrocard system which offers free transfers between subways and buses.) Fares are also heavily subsidized - more than the regular transit system\\nI can see the SI route offering real convenience for residents who commute to parts of midtown 79 days people! My wife and I will be in NY mid September for our first time! We are way too excited, thus, I have been researching and planning and scoping out everything for months now. I have an itinerary of sorts thrown together with lots of gaps. I know all you fine people can help me fill them! We will have 7 (mostly) full days and are up for all suggestions! We are staying half the time at Washington Square Hotel and the other half at Residence Inn Central Park. We had originally had plans to go to Boston the first half of the week to see Aerosmith but they cancelled, again, so we\\'re just gonna spend the whole week in NY but couldn\\'t get the same city view room at Residence so decided to split it up and spend a few nights in the village. Not worried about it being too much trouble and yada yada.\\nSunday - We will arrive around 12 noon and park near Washington Square Hotel. Lunch at Bleeker Street Pizza (or any other pizza place?). Explore Washington Square Park, lay an eye on the Friends apartment building, get breakfast at bakery for the next morning (any bakeries in the village you guys recommend for pastry and the like?) Dinner @ Olio e piu\\nMonday - Get to Harry Potter early to scan for an entry time, High Line park, Chelsea Market, hopefully be time for Harry Potter store, lunch somewhere near that area, Dinner @ La Lanterna\\nTuesday - Bubbys for breakfast, 911 museum and memorial, One World Observatory, Oculus, lunch, walk the Brooklyn Bridge, Dinner @ Tacombi, Emprie State building at night\\nWednesday - Clinton Street Bakery for breakfast, move car to other hotel, Central Park, lunch @ Tavern On The Green?? is it worth it?, History museum, dinner, Circle Line 7 pm cruise\\nThursday - Juniors for breakfast, Rockefeller Center, Macys, shop around until couples massage @ 2:30, back to hotel to get changed, dinner @ Patsy\\'s Italian, Wicked @ 7 pm eek!!\\nFriday - ???\\nSaturday - Yankees game @ 1\\nLike I said, lots of gaps. What is the weather like mid September? Would Coney Island be worth it that time of year? Any day trips you recommend? And of my restaurants you\\'d veto? Thank you guys so much! I\\'ve gotten so much helpful info on here already!!\\nEdited: 4:10 pm, June 23, 2021 Sounds like fun! September weather is usually quite gorgeous, and wonderful to be outside. Coney Island is a definite possibility.\\nIt\\'s actually nice to break up your trip into 2 parts, and get the opportunity to experience another area.\\nI\\'ve never been to Tavern on the Green, so I can\\'t comment. Junior\\'s for breakfast would mean traveling to get there, no? I might not go out of my way for breakfast, but schedule a visit when you\\'re doing something in the neighborhood.\\nEdited: 4:17 pm, June 23, 2021 September is Summer in NYC, weather is perfect\\nI actually have a photo of the friends apartment building\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CKKSpGRrzbS/\\nThere is actually some sort of Cafe at the bottom of it (you can see in the picture, I don\\'t know the name of it) Howard, the restaurant is The Little Owl and it’s one of my favorites (sister restaurant to The Clam, which I often recommend). It’s excellent, but reservations HIGHLY recommended.\\nThe restaurants you’ve chosen are ones getting high number of ratings on Trip Advisor. But as a local, they are not places I would ever go to.\\nBubbo’s is good - the one near the HighLine closed.\\nEdited: 5:04 pm, June 23, 2021 * Bubby\\'s\\nLa Lanterna is a red sauce kind of place, if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for. I would do Loeb Boat House instead of Tavern on the Green. Both are in Central Psrk but the food is better st the Boat House. Bubbys Tribeca It’s still open, and that’s nearer their plans that day, so can assume that will work out .\\nI think the food @Bubbys is excellent, the fried chicken and biscuits were some of the best I’ve ever had in my life.\\nI wouldn’t veto any of the restaurants, Except maybe Tavern on the Green, it doesn’t get good reviews on the food.\\nSuggest flexibility or a back up idea in case you can’t get a table at some places Etc.\\nJuniors in times square is a very busy place and you could find that it’s overrun so you might want to phave another option in mind that day in case.\\nI’ve only eaten at the one in Brooklyn. And there’s never a wait there. I love simple home cooking and its pretty darn good , the portions are huge and servers are so nice.\\nYou should explore Thompson Street and McDougall streets for restaurants. It sounds like you’d like to plan but I would leave some time for some spontaneity in choosing eateries as well.\\nEdited: 5:29 pm, June 23, 2021 Joe\\'s on Carmine Street is perfect for that quintessential NY Style slice:\\nhttp://www.joespizzanyc.com\\nA short walk away is Rocco\\'s on Bleecker Street. They have quite a selection of items. Eat in or take out for example:\\nhttps://pasticceriarocco.com\\nMid September is still summer, but typically after Labor Day, the change is in the air. Mid September is typically gorgeous in terms of temperatures. A rainy day or two is always a possibility, so keep that in mind.\\nEdited: 7:38 pm, June 23, 2021 Tuesday is what I am looking at.\\nThe 9/11 Memorial and Museum is 3-4 hours in my opinion. I have ben twice and could stay longer. Then you are going to 2 observatories on then same day + walking the Brooklyn Bridge.\\nI just think that may be a lot.\\nWednesday.....If you are in that area, try to check this out:\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/see-the-incredible-mural-covering-an-entire-chinatown-street-right-now-062321\\nFriday & Sat? What are your exact dates? Also OWO and the ESB in one day? Fully agree with the 9/11 Memorial and Museum deserving 3 to 4 hours. I\\'ve been there once and spent about 3.5 hours and as ter1413 mentioned, could have spent longer. It is very draining, so keep that in mind for afterwards. Has anyone had success with Jayride online transport agents? They make very big claims but as far as I can see, they don\\'t deliver. We had a houseguest who was going from the Tenement Museum directly to LaGuardia. She booked a pick-up from the Jayride website with the NYC Airporter.\\nI thought she was paying a bit extra for the convenience of a pick-up rather than getting herself to Grand Central. Alas. There was no contact from the bus company on the morning of the departure. When she called they said they NEVER do what Jayride claims they would do.\\nOther than a \"help\" form on the Jayride website (which they promise to answer in 24 hours) there is no way to reach them.\\nSo what\\'s the deal?\\nIncompetent? Fraud?\\nHere is what they put on their website. \"you can compare transport and book directly with hundreds of transport service operators across United States. When you book on Jayride you are booking directly with your transport service company. You get their name, their contact information, and can reach out and arrange details with them directly - all the benefits of going direct, plus Jayride\\'s famous simple booking system, easy instant fixed prices, and 100% refund guarantee. Jayride covers every airport, and 50,000+ local destinations around United States, day or night. We look forward to your booking with us soon!\"\\nJB This company is not famous or well known. Claiming to be famous when it is in fact pretty much unknown would be the first red flag. It also says that you are booking direct, but they weren\\'t cuz it was with another company, the NYC airporter.....doesn\\'t sound good to me... It is always a bad idea to use a service that no one else has ever heard of and claims to do something that doesn\\'t make any sense. (Have never heard of \"jayride\" and have lived in NY my whole life.)\\nDid your friend call the Airporter to confirm that this service existed? Did they already have an Airporter ticket or did they pay \"jayride\" for the airporter ticket as well as the add on ride?\\nThis seems a very odd service. Why not just grab a cab from Tenement museum to the Airporter bus stop? I\\'m sorry I\\'m writing this in NY forums. But we used Jayride service in California (LAX-Oceanside and Carlsbad-LAX). Everything was good. We even changed our plan the night before, but we had no problem communicating with them and they were really nice to help us. We had a little problem though. The morning we left, Jayride gave us a call, saying that the driver assigned to us didn\\'t go to LAX!. 15 mins later they were able to send someone else, which was a big relief since we didn\\'t want to miss the flight!. I Believe it is a scam...they advertise sedan service with a photo of an audi...you pre pay.... so they keep in touch with you because what they actually do is call a Lyft driver.... who shows up in a Toyota Corolla and does not even know what jayride is...... so you need to just book lyft yourself and don\\'t prepay...this is a total scam One should NEVER prepay for airport transfers. With car services they will ask for your CC number so they know you have the money - but they don\\'t charge it until you get to your destination and can add the tip.\\nIf you prepay and anything goes wrong you basically have no recourse.\\nI have noticed that people from UK and O seem to prepay for all sorts of things - which to me makes no sense. Why tie up any more money than you need to (airfare) when situations may change or you may simply change your mind. We pay in advance only for those very few things that are so crowded that advance pay is the only way to get tickets. (Maybe it\\'s people who are more used to tours - which we would never do.) NYC resident here. Your friend got taken. I\\'ve never heard of Jayride. I do use NYC Airporter regularly to get back and forth from my apartment to the airport. I have purchased tickets online with NYC Airporter and also from the agent at the airport. NEVER AGAIN -LEFT US STRANDED RIGHT BEFORE FLIGHT We booked with Jayride Only to have them call 10 minutes before our pickup time to be taken to the Milwaukee airport BY TEXT... Sorry that we had an unfortunate accident and will not be able to pick you up.\\nREALLY ???? Sounded like a lame excuse. THEY NEVER CALLED BACK after we texted them, THEY NEVER TRIED TO GET SOMEONE ELSE TO COVER THEIR BOOKING.... basically just left us stranded. We had to hustle to get an hour long ride to the airport last minute and almost missed our flight. ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE.... WE WILL NEVER AGAIN BOOK JAYRIDE.... NEVER! I have no idea why my message is being deleted... maybe I\\'ll be more specific.\\nI intend to rent an airbnb apartment that has a wood burning fireplace in Manhattan.\\nCan I operate it? Or is there a rule that bans wood burning in the city?\\nThank you. There is a ban on short term rentals first and foremost, and why would anyone on this forum know if the fireplace is ok to use in a random airbnb? I am asking about the future.\\nAnd since there are locals on this forum, why wouldn\\'t people here know about NYC\\'s policy regarding wood burning stoves? The law prohibiting short term rentals isn\\'t going anywhere, so you won\\'t be legally renting an apartment in the future either. that\\'s not the question though :(\\nIf I buy an apartment that has a fireplace,\\nMy question is about the city\\'s policy regarding wood burning fireplaces.\\nIf you know of a better place to ask this question, I\\'d love to know. (I did ask the authorities and got no reply)\\nEdited: 5:35 am, August 16, 2021 Now you\\'re buying an apartment? That\\'s not what you said a minute ago, nor all of the other times you posted this question. They are only legal if they were installed prior to 2014. No new ones have been allowed to be installed since then\\nAnd Most AirBNB\\'s are illegal in NYC and many of them are outright scams. It seems to me that an AirBNB with a wood burning stove is not only illegal, but probsbly doesnt exist either Some Airbnb’s *are* legal (there are plenty in my low-rise neighborhood). Re: the legality of wood-burning fireplaces…new ones are prohibited, but old ones can still be used.\\nOk, now for the plea: please check on the legality of your Airbnb; unless the host is staying in the unit with you, it needs to be in a 1- or 2-family building. And given the very good reasons for banning wood-burning fireplaces in a dense city, maybe think twice about using one. There are less polluting ways to get cozy. There is no ban on burning in woodburning fireplaces. However, you need to be very careful using it. Frankly, if I had someone staying in my apartment, I would not allow them to use it. Too much of a liability risk if they did something stupid.\\nYou need to make sure chimney is in good working condition -- no loose bricks or obstructions, no accumulations of creosote, which could start a chimney fire. Make sure it has a good fire screen. Many city fireplaces are not checked/cleaned regularly, making them fire hazards.\\nWhen using fireplace have to make sure damper is open when using it, closed when not (helps keep mice out). You\\'d be surprised how many people don\\'t understand this and create big smoke eventss or fires when they start fire without opening damper. Creates much excitement in building and leads to large turnout by fire department.\\nI never use mine.\\nEdited: 6:35 am, August 16, 2021 Also note term \"decorative fireplace\" does not mean the fireplace is decorated or anything like that. It means it has been taken out of use, bricked up, and serves only a decorative purpose, so don\\'t even think of starting a fire in such a fireplace as you could start a massive and dangerous building fire.\\nAnd if you insist on using a working fireplace, beware downdrafts. I had one in a fireplace in another apt decades ago and it put me off ever using an indoor city fireplace again.\\nEdited: 5:35 pm, August 16, 2021 Can\\'t you ask the owner of the Airbnb? The restaurant, which first opened in 1913, had closed during the early days of the pandemic and reopened on September 30th, 2020 when indoor dining at 25% had resumed, giving them 75 seats to work with. (The restaurant had no outdoor dining option, being underground.) But then it shut down on October 9th, 2020, due to a lack of business and foot traffic.\\nAccording to the restaurant, they will operate at 100% capacity—including the bar and counter—Mondays through Fridays with COVID safety measures, such as extra space between tables, employee testing, etc. There will also be to-go meals for pickup and delivery within five blocks. The restaurant will require staff and patrons to show proof of vaccination, and guests are asked to wear masks when not eating or drinking.\\nhttps://gothamist.com/food/grand-central-oyster-bar-will-reopen-september-7th Well good for them. I hope some of the other GCT businesses are able to reopen soon, like the large newsstand just off the main concourse, that Scandinavian food operation in the western half of Vanderbilt Hall, and some of the vendors in the GC Market. Eli\\'s finally returned to their spaces, but with only a fraction of their previous offerings -- drastically reduced baked goods, fruits and vegetables, and no flowers. I am used to visiting more than one city when I travel, so when I visit NYC, I plan to go on either a train ride through New York state or to Washington, D.C. to check out two museums and then head back to NYC. I have done day trips to Reno (where I drove 4 hours each way), and day trips to other parts of California that required 2+ hours of travel, so I think going to Washington, D.C. could be possible as long as I really plan out a couple or three places to visit quickly.\\nIf you have done a day trip from NYC, where did you go and what was it like? Most locals do day trips to areas like the beach on Long Island or The Jersey shore or somewhere up the hudson valley where its more countryside\\nYou might do Philly on a day trip\\nWe do not usually do Washington DC or Boston on a day trip, its kind of far, the only time people do day trips to washington dc is if they are going to some sort of protest or event I have taken day trips to Boston and Washington, but they were to see specific museum exhibits and not generally the whole place. You will be spending 6-7 hours minimum traveling in one day. The more expensive Acela trains are about half an hour quicker but have much more expensive tickets. Philadelphia is only half the distance away and a trip there will give you more time to see things. Of course, it all depends on what you want to see be it another city or a natural area. Washington DC is too far for a day trip. Do at least an overnight. New York is a big state. You can do day trips to some places on the train, the Dia Beacon is cool if you like modern art museums. I had an enjoyable day trip to Philadelphia to visit the Barnes Foundation and another one to Baltimore to visit the American Visionary Art Museum.\\nAm planning an overnight trip to DC to visit the Holocaust Museum, Pershing Square and the Museum of African American History. No way would I do that in one day. I\\'ve done a day trip to DC and was able to see a few museums, did the tour of the Capitol Building plus saw the White House from the fence. It\\'s a very long day though, I started around 5.00am and got back to NYC around 11.00pm. The train trip in between is good for resting. Some people can do it and others wouldn\\'t even dream of it. I think the trip report Aynat did for her daytrip to Waahington would be worth reading. Heading out to the Hamptons was fun.\\nI really enjoyed my day trips up the Hudson to visit the Dia Museum at Beacon, walk over the Hudson at Poughkeepsie and see other lovely towns. That train trip is spectacular.\\nWe also went to Philadelphia for a day trip which was great. Like Ztaks the main purpose was to visit the Barnes Foundation, but also saw the Liberty Bell and visited the Art Museum as it was a Friday and they are open late on Friday nights. But we enjoyed the city more on another trip when I stayed there a few days. I have to go to the Barnes, IMO the best site in Philly is the Eastern State Penetentiary. I was in Philly Memorial day weekend, but it was an overnight trip. I went to\\nElfrige Alley, which is one of the oldest streets in the US\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPg0SLPNCuR/\\nI also went to the revolutionary war Museum, I wasnt so thrilled with this museum, Skip this one\\nThe Liberty Bell\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPhEToitDgd/\\nIve never actually been IN the Philadelphia museum of art, but I have been to the Rocky Steps\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPhINmntIJN/\\nYou could probably do Longwood Gardens in one day, This place is special\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPjnb8ENW9L/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPpAvEZNDPq/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPjrA7HNafR/ I don’t think I did a separate trip report for Washington DC, I think it was embedded in my NYC report as it was just a day trip from NYC.\\nIf the OP is interested I could try and dig it up. If I was a tourist and wanted to spend one day out of a NYC trip in DC I wouldn\\'t go back and forth, I\\'d just go for the last day and fly home from DC. Or the first day and visa versa. We are hoping to visit Manhattan after 4 years for three nights early September.\\nI have Shukette booked and have a reservation for the new Daniel Boulud new restaurant, Le Pavillon for anniversary. His style is too classic for me.\\nI am looking for creative food that offers outdoor seating and that is not so easy to find. Some places like Jua and Luthun that I was interested in don\\'t offer outdoor dining.\\nLe Pavillon is indoor only but has a 75 ft ceiling and a great air purifying system supposedly.\\nFinding restaurants has become so much more complicated.\\nPlease help. I went to The View in FiDi on Saturday. There is outdoor dining, the food is really good and the view as well.\\nAnother option, also outdoor is The Fulton, great food, beautiful view.\\nI do find that some restaurant offering outdoor dining also offer tables that are very close together (not the case with the 2 restaurants I am suggesting). I’m glad you’re going to Shukette. Excellent choice.\\nOne place that I keep meaning to go to but haven’t is Jeju. It has a lovely outdoor space in the heart of the Village. I walk by it quite a bit and it always looks so nice (the menu is intriguing, even though I’m not a big noodles person).\\nKyma is a favorite. Sona is excellent if you like Indian food. The Clam is one of my reliable winners, very much a neighborhood place. @jcmtl1965 Thank you.\\nEdited: 1:25 pm, August 23, 2021 @Risa L Thank you. Jeju looks interesting but no reservation for our days. Sona has not such a great reviews and was one of the first places I checked. Well, that’s interesting. Sona may have been the best restaurant I’ve eaten in all year (well, The Girl and The Goat in chicago was stupendous) so maybe that means it will be easier to get reservations there now! -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 7:18 pm, September 10, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 7:18 pm, September 10, 2021 Also, I haven’t been to this restaurant yet, but it was recommended by a friend who owns his own Japanese restaurant, so he knows of what he speaks: https://www.bbfkapposono.com/bbftop\\nHe also recommended Accidental Bar, a new sake bar.\\nEdited: 2:22 pm, August 23, 2021 Albert Potato Thank you. We have stayed several times on the Upper West Side and really enjoy being outside of the hustle bustle of the city and within walking distance of the park.... but even though we travel to other parts of the city, you never really learn all about it unless you stay there.....we thought about Chelsea.... we have stayed in Greenpoint a few times too, but want to stay in Manhatten this next visit in November..... Any suggestions??? Chelsea is a good choice, also consider Union Square, the Flatiron District, the Village, and Soho. Greenwich Village, East Village, Tribeca - all lovely, residential areas. I love the UWS. Brooklyn or Chelsea are the next on my list. Yea try staying downtown in the places mentioned in posts 1 &2, since there are a lot of options and it can give you a slightly different feel.\\nEdited: 2:20 pm, August 21, 2021 I know you want to stay in Manhattan, but if you want a different feel Brooklyn or Queens is a difernt feel Just be aware that many if not most of the hotels with Chelsea in their names are not really in the heart of Chelsea but rather just south of midtown in what was the fur district and the flower district. I think the village is great although very few hotels there... the Washington Square hotel has a great location but most rooms are small. The Marlton, the Standard East Village and the Walker are some newer options but also small rooms. The Giraffe on lower Park Ave is also a nice idea and well liked. I know Chelsea has been recommended a lot, but I\\'d look at places below 14th Street, rather than there.\\nI consider Tribeca too, and there are some great hotels in Soho, which is a decent area. If you head slightly east of Chelsea you’ll come to NoMad and the Flatiron district. These are lovely areas with a vibrant food scene and stores and the lovely Madison Square Park. There are quite a few hotels in this area and good subway access.\\nIf you want to consider Brooklyn again, downtown Brooklyn is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge and has a few hotels. Vibrant area for restaurants and cafes within a short walk. It’s an easy walk to Brooklyn Bridge Park and the ferry over to Manhattan, as well as good subway access.\\nLong Island City is also up and coming and is just across the East River from Manhattan. I agree with lower Manhattan (Tribeca) even the Financial District is a different perspective of Manhattan. For Mid November I am seeing good deals on:\\n5* Conrad New York Downtown\\n4*Gild Hall A Thompson Hotel\\n3*Hilton Garden Inn New York/Tribeca\\nWhatever you decide, Enjoy & Stay safe. I usually travel to and from Newark airport and am familiar with it. My son and I are meeting in JFK for a trip. He is coming from NC. We shall arrive home from Paris at 4 pm and the latest flight to RDU is 7:30. That should be enough time for customs and most likely another terminal, correct? Thank you. It\\'s doable.\\nI am someone who doesn\\'t like to rush, so I would want more time. I know it\\'s not possible in your case. with on time arrivals and reasonable customs etc. \"should\" be okay...have a plan and keep moving !! That can be a tough slog. If you\\'re not already familiar with the JFK Airtrain (or Delta jitney) take a look at the map https://jfkairport.com/at-airport/connecting-flights Thank you, that is very helpful. Hi there, I was wondering if anybody could help me with a 4 day itinerary. I have one, but not sure if it’s all over the place so I thought I would ask for a little guidance?\\nWe will be seeing a show when we arrive on the evening of our first night as we arrive around 5pm. We leave on thanksgiving very late on, so on this day we are going to watch the parade from our hotel room and have some dinner in our hotel before we leave. We would also like to go a nice walk on this day too when the parade is over. We have 4 full days between these days to explore…\\nBrooklyn bridge\\n9/11 memorial museum\\nStatue of Liberty\\nEmpire State Building\\nGrand central\\nRockefeller centre\\nCentral Park\\nWe would also have a day of shopping in here too.\\nWe have also been looking up lots of places to eat or any little gems to visit so would appreciate if anybody had any suggestions? We are not fussy eaters and are open to anything wether it be cheap and cheerful or a little more on the expensive side.\\nI hope I have given enough information.\\nThank you for reading and I would appreciate any information/guidance. I find it tough to plan for a show on arrival day, especially at the hour you arrive. What happens if you encounter a flight delay, traffic getting from the airport to hotel, etc.\\nI would group by area, for example:\\n1). 9/11 Memorial & Museum with the Brooklyn Bridge.\\n2). Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island and other downtown attractions, there are many, take a look:\\nhttps://downtownny.com/\\n3). Empire State Building, Grand Central, Rockefeller Center, Central Park. I assume you mean a Broadway show. Are you arriving Sunday or Monday? In normal times, there are very few Broadway shows playing Sunday evening and practically none on Monday. Even if your flight is on time, you breeze through Immigration and Customs, have no problems with traffic and get to your hotel quickly and eat quickly so you get to the theatre in time for the curtain .... your body will think it is midnight and you will struggle to stay awake once the lights go down. Don\\'t do it. Are you sure your hotel room will have a good view of the Thanksgiving Day parade? Did you book the hotel\\'s Thanksgiving Day special for a room that\\'s on a low floor on the parade side of the hotel so you get a good view of the floats? Thank you all for your replies. I will take them all on board. Yes, my husband has sorted all of this and spoke directly with the hotel. We usually visit in the winter and we went on the Staten Island ferry twice (freezing) just to aim to stay awake as long as poss . You may doze off during the show! Walking is good 1st night, sight seeing exploring local around your hotel iconic sights Walk the Brooklyn bridge /Times Square as time difference -that tiredness gets you! Thank you for your reply. With what you have listed, you have plenty of time to see it all in 4 days.\\nYou could do this as a suggestion:\\n- Brooklyn bridge. Also include Brooklyn Bridge Park and the water front and see Jane\\'s Carousel. Call into Time Out Market for lunch or have pizza at Juliana\\'s. Note, it\\'s better to walk back to Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge rather than the other way around. So take the subway or even the ferry directly to the Dumbo pier in Brooklyn, look around, then walk the bridge back to Manhattan.\\n- 9/11 memorial museum and Statue of Liberty. Go the statue first thing especially if you have Pedestal /Crown tickets (crowds are less in the morning), then go to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. The Museum will need 2-3 hours. If you have the time after that, walk to Wall Street and see the Stock Exchange etc.\\n- Grand central, Rockefeller centre. These are not far from each other and you can walk between the two. Walk via 5th Ave to see the high-end stores. While you\\'re in the Grand Central area, also go to Bryant Park which is lovely and call into the NY Public Library which is right there. Lovely inside and out. Maybe call into St Patrick\\'s Cathedral on the way up 5th Ave. It\\'s stunning. Time Square is also not far, go there at night for the lights.\\n- Central Park. It\\'s a big park but maybe not worth a whole day unless you adore parks. Maybe call into The Met Museum (east side of the park) or the American Museum of Natural History (west side of the park), or even one of the smaller museum on each side of the park.\\nThe Empire State Building is good to see at night. You\\'ll see the whole city in lights from up there. So work out which day you prefer to slot that into. Top of the Rock and The Edge are two other observatories you might consider. TOTR is better in the daytime or at sunset if you decide on that one. When I was in high school, I was in the Macy\\'s parade. We had to wake up at 2am for our in person rehearsal time slot and then just stay up for many hours to rehearse, wait and perform. That night we had tickets to a Broadway show. I- and many others- fell asleep. And we were young, perky teens. I wouldn\\'t risk being jet lagged and rushing to get to a show especially given how much they cost. Weather and Thanksgiving crowds can definitely derail your timeline too. Half day trip (PM): You can take the ferry (from 34th Pier) to Dumbo, walk the Brooklyn bridge to Manhattan. Then, walk to The whitehall terminal to take the staten island ferry (back and forth). To finish, you can walk to Chinatown for diner, then gelato in little Italy for dessert! As someone who has seen a lot of shows & packs them in when I\\'m in the city (I think my record is 7 shows in 3 days), I do hope you haven\\'t bought your show tickets yet as I can guarantee you won\\'t make the curtain. Even if I\\'m wrong on that, you\\'ll be so stressed out about trying to get to the theater on time that you won\\'t really enjoy the 1st half of the show. Hello, I am in NY for a couple of days with my daughter. Looking for a Sunday morning service in a gospel church in Harlem. Not looking for a show but for a different spiritual experience if possible. I would appreciate any suggestion. Thanks! Check out this list https://freetoursbyfoot.com/gospel-music-harlem/\\nBe sure to verify current schedules and covid policies Thank you for the suggestion! I was hoping to find a less touristy option if possible... This may sound snarky on the page, but I mean it sincerely. If you don\\'t want \"touristy\" options, then maybe better not to seek them out on a site that caters primarily to tourists. Perhaps there are church groups or religious sites to consult? There is one DE who lives in Harlem, but we can\\'t assume he knows everything about everything in the neighborhood. I would suggest looking on websites for the religious denomination that you\\'re looking for, rather than a tourist site. It\\'s possible, of course, that someone may randomly have ideas for you, but church sites would be far more reliable than a travel site. Your own religious leader may even have better suggestions than you may get here.\\nEdited: 11:41 pm, August 21, 2021 I dont think someone should visit a house of worship unless that place either caters to tourists or is more open to outsiders. Between covid and general safety issues, many places do not want outsiders coming in . If you arent sure ASK before I didn\\'t mean to find a church that is not open to tourists, just a small type of church, not the ones with big loud shows for tourists (like the Bethel Gospel Assembly). Many churches are also still closed due to Covid, so I thought this forum would be an option to get suggestions. Thanks. I hope the suggestions above about where else to look for suitable suggestions will be helpful to you. Good luck! Its not just covid, Some churches are worried about some Psycho coming in and shooting people Did this place close down? It is a great family restaurant. Yup, permanently closed it seems, after having done a Google search. I think I\\'d go to Becco in that general area. Are you sure Maxi, when I do I search I see that it\\'s opening at 5pm?\\nAlthough it is quite possible since a lot of restaurants in the Times Square looked permanently closed. Says so for me when googling Patzeria Family & Friends. If that\\'s not right, well then I\\'m sorry. https://www.facebook.com/patzeriafamily/\\n\"Due to these uncertain times, it is with heavy hearts that we announce the closing of Patzeria Family & Friends on Sunday, November 15th\\u202c.

People seem confused but they told them to go to shelter. Honestly with a daily case average of 2,000 new covid cases a day and a hurricane heading to the area and NY under a state of emergency one questions the logic of the mayor allowing this to go forward. It is unfortunate for those who wanted to see the show but may be for the best in the long run. Don\\'t need people getting hurt and while some people socially distanced outside I saw large crowds of people many without masks packed together which is a recipe for a super spreader event. They are trying to see if they can have the concert once the severe weather passes even if it is without an audience. Anyone who was at the Diana Ross concert in 1983 (I was - what an odyssey, to say the least), knows that calling it is the way to go. I remember running through the Park barefoot with flooding that was well over my knees. Crazy things happened that night. I hope the people leaving the Park tonight have FAR better experiences. I was at the DR concert too.\\nLived over at 1st Ave at the time.\\nBy the time we got back to my place soaked to the skin and clothes weighed a ton.\\nLuckily I had enough bathrobes for all of us to change into We are planning a family trip to NYC in October. As I\\'m starting to research our plan, curious if there are certain things people know are closed at this point? For example, I saw that the NBC Studios Tour is not open.\\nAnything else anyone is aware of (realizing things change all the time!).\\nThanks Are you sure that the NBC Studio tour is closed? I was in Rockefeller Center on Friday and saw a tour start. At first I thought it might be a crowd for the Tonight Show but it was only 11:30am and there were approximately 10 to 12 persons. I am quite sure it was an NBC tour as they were coming out of an NBC Service room. Not much that will matter to a visitor\\nHowever there are covid requirements for some activities that you should be aware of https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page Direct from the NBC website:\\n“ 30 ROCKEFELLER PLAZA, NYC\\nThe Tour at NBC Studios has been paused until further notice.\\nPlease check back for updates or call (212) 664-3700 for more information.” IrishFan I realize the website mentions that it\\'s not happening, but if I were CS10905 I would call because I definitely did see something that looked like a tour group in Rockefeller Center.\\nAs for things closed, besides Broadway, I did notice quite a few restaurants closed in the Times Square area, but everything else if opened.\\nFor museums you will need a timed ticket. Since you are researching for October I suggest you contact the places that actually interest you directly in September. People expected things to be back to normal, but the rise of Covid variants has derailed this. There are some restaurants and Broadway shows that did not survive the shutdowns. We are still in a wait and see situation and researching things in September as suggested makes a good deal of sense. My $.02.... there will be loads to do in NYC in Oct UNLESS COVID starts to really get crazy again. There are intermittent closings of some businesses. A FedEx Kinkos or UPS store that\\'s open one day may be closed the next. I assume these have more to do with staff shortages than anything else -- i.e. oeople don\\'t show up to work so the business doesn\\'t open because it can\\'t get backup. There have also been some closings among quick bite- type places to eat, likely because office workers haven\\'t returned to work, though if you hadn\\'t known they were there you might not miss them. I was surprised the other day to see a Starbucks that had reopened about a year ago after the initial lockdown had now suddenly closed .It\\'s near one of the hospitals, generally popular with hospital workers, in a fairly residential,area so not as dependent on office workers, so I was surprised to see that. Maybe with the pickup in virus cases the medical workers aren\\'t mingling with the public as much. Restaurants, hotels, museums, etc, will need to see your vaccinated status to let you in. **Restaurants, hotels, museums,**\\nIncorrect!\\nHotels are not included.\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines-keytonyc.page Update this with others as you know them\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/08/21/trains-flights-canceled-as-nyc-braces-for-hurricane-henri/ It has been downgraded to a tropical storm. I\\'m in Suffolk County it\\'s just a heavy rain with minimal wind. Montauk was hit hard. Now Rhode Island is getting slammed. The storm was greatly exaggerated here, not even branches down, Just rain Considering a trip to NYC this weekend. I\\'d like to know if hotels and businesses are really asking customers to provide vaccination certificates? Thank you. My gym did today. My gym did as well. If you are unvaccinated and think you are going to skirt the rules then maybe you shouldn\\'t make the trip. I don\\'t think it extends to hotels though, other than their restaurants. Also, it is for indoor not outdoor dining. At least that is my recollection.\\nEdited: 11:22 pm, August 16, 2021 Yes. They are.\\nBring your vaccination card or a photo of it. Yes. A Starbucks and Eataly in the World Trade Center asked me for it today. They accepted looking at a photo of my vaccination record in my iPhone. Yes, for the most part, I will admit there might be more obscure parts of the city where there arent any tourists or day workers and maybe the stores wont ask there as its more of a small town feel as opposed to a big city (There are places in NYC will small town feels and everyone is sort of connected to everyone else) Most people in NYC support this law, I prefer being asked for a vax certificate than having to wear a mask Yesterday, August 16th, Shake Shack at The Fulton Center did not ask for proof of vaccination. Read the link in #6.\\nThe requirement (officially) goes into effect today I am SHOCKED there is actually a Radio Shack still in NYC Hi co-travellers!\\nMe and my wife want to spend our honey moon at NYC on Christmas holidays. We want to spend 10-12 nights there strictly between 22/dec - 9/jan. So which is the best time to go according to your experience? Can you give any extra tips?\\nThanks in advance for your time! Christmas week is much more affordable, until about December 27 or 28, when hotel prices start to climb exponentially until January 1. Hotel prices fall dramatically starting January 2, but the \"fun\" is over. Decorations start to come down and special events are over, but the crowds are also gone so sites like museums are much more pleasant. I go for Christmas and come home before New Year\\'s Eve because it\\'s not worth it to me to pay those hotel prices. thanks for your response! But as I said we can come to NYC on 22th the earliest so if we want to stay at least 10 nights as I said, then we will have to stay up to at least 1-2 of Jan. Then the prices drop yes as I saw on my online hotel prices search already. FYI I found out that total package might be cheaper if we stay for example 28/dec-9/jan than 22/dec-1/jan For ,me, unless you want to brave the madness of New Year\\'s Eve, it\\'s not worth the expense to stay through January 1 & it\\'s much less expensive and more festive to stay over Christmas & get out of town before all the crazies show up for the ball drop. IMNSHO Frankly I don\\'t understand your question. Any way you cut it with the parameters your have you’ll be here for NYE. If you,re going to buy a package, pick the dates that are least expensive. Keep in mind NY Eve is an expensive night if you want to go out and party. The city is quieter after NYE. If it was my trip, I\\'d stay a week and eave before NYE or go someplace else for NYE. Sorry, I\\'m confused about your question as well. You\\'re trying to decide on 10 nights between Dec 22 and Jan 9? If you come on Dec 22 then you should be still be in NYC for New Years. Are you basically asking whether you should come in time for Christmas or skip it and come a few days after? Sadly, we don\\'t know what this winter is going to look like.\\nThe Delta variant has changed everything. We were optimistic that things would be great by now, but Covid has ramped up again over the summer. Too many people remain unconvinced to get vaccinated at all, when it looks like those of us who have been are going to need a booster 8 months after completing our initial series, starting with the first responders and nursing home residents who were first vaccinated next month. Numbers are rising, including in New York. There\\'s still no word on when children under 12 will be able to be vaccinated. If the pandemic isn\\'t tamped down soon, numbers will probably only rise when we\\'re driven indoors again by cold weather.\\nI wouldn\\'t make any reservations you couldn\\'t get refunded for, and you\\'d also have to consider getting trapped if there are suddenly plane travel lockdowns again with minimal notice. We\\'re all so, so tired and disheartened, but as the experts are saying, Covid doesn\\'t care. I agree with many previous comments, however I would plan to arrive on the 22nd. You will feel the full Christmas / Holiday vibe in the city then and it will be a happy, but busy, experience especially in Midtown. Other areas are quieter yet the vibe is still there and lovely.\\nStaying for NYE doesn\\'t have to be the busy Times Square ball drop experience, you can have a nice dinner in a local restaurant away from Times Square and stay somewhere for midnight drinks, or go to the Central Park fireworks.\\nThe issue with staying for NYE is that room rates are double or triple what a regular night would be. If that\\'s not an issue, stay for sure and enjoy NYE in some way.\\nMake sure everything you reserve is cancellable and refundable. We’ve visited New York during the Christmas season a few times and fly home Dec 29 or 30. This saves money, yet we get to enjoy the holiday decorations, music, festive events & performances.\\nLove NYC during the holidays! And typically avoid crowds, which means NYE at home, which makes us both happy. Yes actually the question should be should I skip Christmas and stay more days after NYE that should be cheaper or should I stay both Christmas and NYE but probably more expensive? Christmas \\'season\\' is great, IMO, in NYC with the decorations and all.\\nChristmas \\'day\\' is pretty much a wasted day for a lot of tourists with so many things being closed.\\nIt\\'s really up to you. Personally I like walking around cities when things are closed and crowds down for a day, and don\\'t like typical NYE in a crowded city.....but I\\'m boring and it\\'s your money not mine.\\nBy the way no need to think Christmas is \\'probably\\' more expensive. Just do some dummy bookings and find out for sure. I\\'d think hotels would be cheap Christmas eve and Christmas day at least because it\\'s a holiday that typically people spend in family homes.\\nEdited: 4:55 am, August 21, 2021 I was wondering if anyone knew if there are going to be any street festivals , or any events where they shut a certain area down due to events next weekend, the 28/29th. We are coing into the city and looking for a few things to wander around to.\\nThank You We google “street fairs nyc” before each of our trips and find lots of websites with info. https://newyorkled.com/nyc_events_street_fairs/\\nCheck ^ mid week. I would be cautious about the Woolworth Building. The terra cotta exterior has a nasty and expensive secret. It was well-known that this shrinks in the kiln in the firing process. However, only recently did it become known that it slowly expands over the years. The pressure on some of the exterior panels was so great that they burst off the facade. Many of these were replaced at great expense, but more costs might be expected in the future. I wonder how it sounds in that top apartment when lightning strikes. One of our physicians has a medical practice in the Woolworth Building. We are in the Building a few times each year. The lobby and elevators are gorgeous and we have never been hit by exploding terracotta.\\nCH You were not hit because much was replaced around 1980. The cost of the replacement terra cotta was described at the time as \"shocking.\" Condo owners are collectively responsible for exterior repairs. The fact that this is a landmark only increases costs. The lobby is one of the best in the city as mentioned. Is there any link to an article that isn\\'t the racist daily mail newspaper?

Before the lockdown they had drastically cut back service hours and switched to a smaller minibus. Then I think they stopped altogether, at least in early days of pandemic. I don\\'t know if service has resumed. Did the JFK website say anything? I have an international flight scheduled out of JFK tomorrow night and Hurricane Henri is inbound. Other than getting information from the specific airline for which I haven\\'t seen any updates yet are there other prime sources concerning the status of arrival/departures from JFK during weather events like this? I\\'m trying to get a sense on if I need to change hotel bookings and rework my schedule ahead of time before cancellation deadlines pass. Start with tracking the plane. From where is it coming? You\\'ll be able to see if that flight is cancelled hours (maybe even a day) before that same plane is scheduled to depart with you on it. @1 yep I am tracking it. It hasn\\'t left yet, but would be coming out of Dubai. My best guess is that my flight crew is already positioned in NY having arrived this morning and then staying overnight to prepare for the flight back tomorrow night. I think my bigger concern is how airport operations at JFK will be impacted. Like if a lot of flights get cancelled or pushed back does that domino into knocking other flights out that are scheduled to depart for the evening that have their equipment and crews in place or does JFK just placed delayed flights into whatever openings there are and doesn\\'t kick ready planes out of their pre-arranged departure slots? When is the plane scheduled to be back at JFK?\\nI\\'d be kind of surprised if they decide to bring equipment into the area in the next day or so @3 that\\'s the thing Kaye if they let the flight depart Dubai it would be coming in right around the time the storm is making landfall. Of course the eye of the storm is east of JFK and my understanding the higher winds are to the east of the eye. I\\'m wondering if they would try to fly in from the north and west of the storm into JFK. They have another a380 that is scheduled to fly out tonight. I wonder if they might delay that flight a night and consolidate the passengers on tomorrow\\'s flight. I kinda doubt they would do that because it would jam up people who were supposed to depart tonight. Or in the alternative I wonder if they just delay departure out of dubai for a few hours so they end up arriving in early afternoon instead of in the morning when the storm may be a bit more north of the airport. That way they would have the plane in place and only one flight would be delayed but not cancelled. i am flying out from jfk at 8 am,\\nso far airline is listing flights leaving jfk at 2 pm as cancelled status but 5 pm ok\\nunfortunately flight cancellation happens on the day of the flight so hard to plan ahead\\nhurricane apparently hitting long island 11 am to noon. My understanding is the storm would make landfall at like 8am but the eye would be over long island around 11am. I guess the question becomes how far east does this storm move. Well the plane is taxiing out so I guess they are going for it. Will be interesting to see how they adjust their flight route, because the normal route they use is going to have serious turbulence when they fly right into the middle of the storm. Some other Twitter account I follow (MTA updates, maybe) has been retweeting JFK and LaGuardia\\'s twitter accounts, so I\\'ve come across severa cancellation announcements from @JFKairport today, including this one: https://twitter.com/JFKairport/status/1429247456261328904. Probably not the best source for updates, but could be helpful. The latest hurricane tracks show it moving considerably east. Like making landfall over in eastern connecticut. I\\'m cautiously optimistic that flights will be able to get out of JFK tomorrow, especially as we head into the afternoon and evening. It\\'s also supposed to weaken really fast within a few hours of making landfall. due to the hurricane My grounds pass mobile ticket for Sept, 4 @ 11 AM has a section number, a row number, and a seat number. I had thought that the tickets were general admission, to wander around the grounds and enter the various stadiums. Why do I have a seat number? \"Grounds Only passes do you provide a reserved seat anywhere at the US Open and do not provide access to the main stadium court, Arthur Ashe Stadium. To access the matches at Arthur Ashe, you will need to purchase a regular US Open ticket for one of the sessions. Buying a Grounds Pass to the US Open is an inexpensive way to see this quality tennis tournament.\"\\nhttps://www.ticketcity.com/tennis/us-open-tennis-grounds-admission-only-tickets.html Look at your ticket carefully. That may be for a seat in Armstrong. But they don’t worry much about assigned seats. It’s a Ticketmaster resale ticket for the grounds. It says Section GA1, Row GA 6, seat 47. I think you may be right about Armstrong stadium. Del Friscos Double Eagle Steakhouse or Prime? I heard Del Friscos is under new management and not as good. I adore their crab cakes or I have at other locations. I also love the Berries snd Bubbles cocktail at Ocean Prime. We are taking out daughter who lives there out to meet her new beau. Also considering Seafire Grill. Thoughts or suggestions are much appreciated. Don\\'t know what you mean by new management at Del Friscos. It a chain, formerly publicly traded but then acquired by a PE shop a few years ago. Its fine and the crab cakes are probably the best thing on the menu. If you want to go out for steaks DF is not the best steakhouse in the City. Ocean Prime is ok too but not a steakhouse. Both are part of the corporate T&E rotation and I\\'ve eaten at both more times than I can count. Do you want a steakhouse or just a good restaurant that also serves steak? If that is the case, for the budget I would suggest Marea. The food there is better than either DF or OP and they do have a very nice dry aged steak available. The pasta is extremely good. While I am not big on chain resturants; I like Ocean Prime. No complaints here.\\nHowever, I prefer Club A Steak House http://www.clubasteakhouse.com/ Take a look at Smith Wollensky too:\\nhttps://www.smithandwollenskynyc.com/\\nI like their classic ambience and the Colorado Rib steak (big serving, bit pricey). I’m kind of confused. Do you want a seafood place or a steak house? If both, perhaps Carne Mare would work for you. It’s an “Italian chophouse” at pier 17, so also has an emphasis on seafood.\\nhttps://www.carnemare.com/\\nI don’t really understand the point of going to a chain restaurant in NYC. I’m all about going local rather than going to the NYC outpost of a restaurant you can go to at home.\\n(Caveat: I’ve only been to Carne Mare for drinks - I don’t eat meat. But it’s been well received).\\nEdited: 11:50 pm, August 20, 2021 Please can someone help me with the best way to travel to Hoboken from JFK Airport. I am flying into JFK on the 27th at around 13:40. I have looked at the following route: Air Train Jamaica (Red) from Terminal 4. Transfer at Jamaica Station. Jamaica Station to Pennsylvania station via Babylon 115. Walk to 33rd Street station & take PATH train to Hoboken.\\nWould this be a good route? I don\\'t want to take a taxi as it would be too expensive. Any tips would be much appreciated. That can work\\nAn alternative is to take the subway from Jamaica instead of the LIRR\\nYou can either take the E Train all the way to Penn Station and then walk over to Herald Square (33rd St) for the PATH\\nOr make a free same-platform transfer from the E to the F (at Kew Gardens or Forest Hills) and then make the connection within the Herald Square complex\\nSubway map https://new.mta.info/map/5256 Another alternative is as follows: (involves a subway fare and a path fare, so quite economical)\\n1) Catch Airtrain to Howard Beach (pay $7.75 to include the subway fare for 2) below)\\n2) Catch Subway A Train to Fulton Street (towards Manhattan direction)\\n3) Use the underpass and walk about 5 min to WTC Path station (ask someone for direction if in doubt)\\n4) Catch the Path train to Hoboken ($2.75 - can use Metro card too if you do not have Smartlink card)\\nNote that there are two lines in WTC Path stations, one to Hoboken (closest to entrance), and one to Newark (furthest away). This is the case on Friday afternoon Aug 27th. So catch the Path train on the Hoboken line and it only goes one way since WTC is the last stop.\\n(* On weekends, WTC only has one line to Newark - need to change at Grove St station to go to Hoboken *)\\nThe above route is quite economical, and will be undercover until Hoboken, so good for all weather condition. It will take an indirect route to Manhattan via Willets Point. Travel time will be 30 minutes (they say). When will we be able to use it? 2025 (they say):\\nhttps://www.abetterwaytolga.com/\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/laguardia-airport-airtrain-faa-approval/?utm_source=TPG%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2618934&utm_usr=9e594564580372016592cac97c9beb137cdcdbf814ce05cfdb43095b9c0df7f1&utm_msg=f4047286cb604a0f8f7901373da695a5&utm_date=2021-07-21 This \"indirect\" business is exaggerated. The station is only 3k feet east of the eastern end of LGA. It is the only way to reach the subway other than bulldozing a right of way through Jackson Heights or building a tunnel under the runway to Astoria. The hype that bothers me is the LIRR serviced that presently stops at Citi Field only during events. The trains on the Port Washington line are not all that frequent. I often take the subway from Penn Station as I can get to Flushing quicker than waiting for the next LIRR train. The proposal suggests one will be able to go by LIRR to Grand Central or Penn Station. This would likely be every other train and you would have to wait an hour---hardly worth it. I suppose one could transfer at Woodside. The LIRR ride to Penn Station from Flushing is 20 mins. The whole subway/LIRR complex at Citi Field needs to be rebuilt. The walkway is presently of very rough wood and is nearly lethal.\\nEdited: 6:03 pm, July 21, 2021 As usual the Gothamist comments are entertaining https://gothamist.com/news/faa-approves-cuomos-21-billion-laguardia-airtrain-project And exactly when was the last time Andy Big Boy, \"I\\'m an expert on public transit,\" Cuomo actually lowered his royal tush onto the seat of a train, subway car or bus?\\nThis is one of the biggest wastes of money I have ever seen and a perfect example of everything Cuomo is all about -- wasting tons of money on a project he knows nothing about and that neither he nor many members of the public (likely mostly tourists) will use but which will generate millions for his campaign war chest from contractors looking to build it.\\nEdited: 1:11 am, July 22, 2021 I will,bet any amount of money it won’t be running by 2026. More on the topic\\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/88nkx4/congrats-to-andrew-cuomo-on-his-useless-laguardia-airtrain Obviously, having a subway line going directly to the LGA would have been the better thing. The problem with the Astoria line extension is what happens at the end of the runway by Plane View Park at 82nd St. Even the street lights there are made extra low and there could be no elevated line. The alternative would be an expensive tunnel plus the cost of buying property in Astoria by eminent domain. The Main St., Flushing, terminus is usually the busiest station outside of Manhattan and you cannot divert #7 trains from there.\\nI would rather have the air train terminate next to the subway station at the same level to make for easier transfer, The proposed terminus has elevators to the rough boardwalk and then ramps and stairs to the subway. All that said, the Second Avenue subway was first proposed in 1920 has not yet been completed after more than 100 years. We are not holding our breath on this \"proposal\".....\\nCH I agree that the speed of the trip into Manhattan is grossly exaggerated in the LGA Airtrain project’s PR; it presumes an LIRR train magically materializes within seconds of arriving at the station.\\nI suppose that for some visitors flying into LaGuardia, the availability of a shiny new train will increase their comfort with taking public transit into the city, which I guess is good. (Anything that reduces the number of private vehicles clogging the streets is good in my book.)\\nBut for me & many other locals, the new route turns what’s now a 2-seat ride (Q70 to a subway station serving a bunch of lines or M60 to any of a number of stations) into at least a 3 seat ride (Airtrain to either the LIRR or the already-crowded 7 train to whatever train you actually need). So no, I won’t be using it.\\nAs folks may know, I’m Team Bus. Run more M60 and Q70 buses; make them free at the airport (everyone is going to be transferring anyhow, why stress & confuse visitors with SBS ticket machines); create and enforce dedicated bus lanes to speed them on their way; spiff up the Jackson Hts/Roosevelt Av station a bit (clean the elevators, maybe put in a damn escalator); advertise the hell out of the bus-to-subway connection.\\nProblem solved, at a small fraction of the cost (and time) of the new Airtrain.\\nEdited: 6:44 pm, July 22, 2021 There is a stigma with buses. Many people wont take them because they have a certain connotation. Trains dont have that stigma, thats why you need a train\\nAt the end of next year the LIRR will be able to go to Grand Central, When that happens , LIRR service can be increased. Most of you dont know this, but Queens has the most transit deserts in the city , It has a large population and because it was mostly developed after World war 2, there are not enough Subway lines. However there is the LIRR, there are proposals (That likely will pass) to convert the LIRR lines in Queens to Subway lines, Charge $2.75 and allow a free transfer to the Subway. There is a LIRR line that serves Northeast Queens . That can increase service from Little Neck Queens to grand central with a stop at citifield once that connection is finished to grand central.\\nPersonally it doesnt have much use for me, I use Taxis or Ubers to get to the Airport. I live 15 mins from JFK or LGA by Car service and its like $25 to either. Its not worth taking a bus or a train to get there (Its either 2 buses to LGA (Not the Q70, the Q48)) or 2 buses (One of which is the Q10 that only stops at terminal 5) to JFK or a Bus and the Airtrain to JFK \"There is a stigma with buses. Many people wont take them because they have a certain connotation.

I support the LGA Airtrain, Im just not sure if it will happen with Cuomo gone Will you be riding the LGA air train Howard? And could you explain to us why you support that over a line that goes straight into Manhattan (with NO changes or buses required) -- whether through construction of a new line it expansion of an existing line? They need to completely replace the EWR Airtrain which is less than 30 years old? Really?\\nThe current proposal for the LGA Airtrain is dumb and will hopefully be reconsidered Its stupid for me to take any Airtrain, for 2 people it costs $7.75 + $2.75 each person for the bus and a Cab from my house to JFK or LGA is about $20-$25 . Its the same money\\nI live near the Van wyck and getting people out of Cabs is good for me. That highway is jammed enough, less cabs means less traffic.\\nYou cant expand the Subway to LGA because the People in Astoria fought it (NIMBY) and they stopped it in the 1990\\'s\\nThe reality is people don\\'t like buses, there is a Stigma to them, but they will take a train\\nAnd finally homefully when its built they will build another section from Citifield to Jamaica allowing people to get from LGA to JFK and people will take that instead of a cab\\nis it the best route? Of course not, but the better options have other issues from Engineering issues , Being the the Flight Path of Trains, NIMBYISM, Its the easiest to make for all those reasons.\\nIf you built it they will come and people will use it\\nEdited: 3:46 pm, August 19, 2021 If it were not so expensive, there are many airport employees that live in Queens and would benefit from rail service.

Please give me your opinions on what is best to do and if you give me subway information, please realize you are talking to two people who never take the subway so we need the dumbed down version and explicit instructions. I did hear that the west farm stop would be the one to get off but what to do once we actually get in the subway station what to look for etc. what to listen for etc. is what I would need if a subway is what most people suggest. Also would need info for the way back thank you very much Subway is the best Way\\nEasiest Way to get from Holiday Inn is walk to 34th St and 7th Ave and take the 2 Train to West Farms Square in the Bronx and walk 2 blocks to the Zoo, I think its less than an hour to get there, there arent any buses for this and an Uber will cost you about $50\\nEdited: 3:52 pm, August 19, 2021 Google maps, or the safari app, are very helpful w step by step info when you get out of the subway. Ive never been to the West Farms Subway Station, but I bet there are signs there telling you where to go, I suppose you can ask someone too Google maps is good. Also available is Citymapper app for your smart phone.\\nWith Citymapper - enter your starting point or you use your location that very moment. Enter your ending point —and it tells you exactly what to do -\\nSuch as walk a block turn left etc. enter the subway at such and such entrance, it tells you what train you need to find the number ( and color) whether it’s uptown or downtown.\\nIt tells you exactly how to get to the best exit out of subway, and even rings to let you know when your stop coming up.\\nI get around the city like an expert. As a newbie reading the subway map did not help me very much - all those colors and numbers . I couldn’t decipher it . I learned the subway and Geography of NYC by using this app\\nPS I would do exactly as post number one says. I did a quick google street view and it looks like you can see the entrance to the Zoo from the Subway on Boston Road Read this for an orientation to the subway http://www.nycsubwayguide.com/subway/\\nYou\\'ll be taking the Bronx (north) bound 2 train. You do not want the 1 or 3 trains which also stop at Penn Station. Subway map https://new.mta.info/map/5256\\nThe guide linked has instructions and pictures of what to look for on the station signage and the train markings\\nDon\\'t worry this is a very straightforward trip.\\nThe Express Bus option is more expensive and no more convenient https://bronxzoo.com/plan-your-visit/getting-here/transit The West Farms Square Subway Station is outside so its a little easier than an underground station where one can get disoriented Just look at google maps so you know which direction you need to walk when coming out of the train. Memorize certain landmarks to make sure you walk the right direction upon leaving the subway. If you walk in the right direction the road takes you directly to the entrance of the zoo. You can\\'t miss it and it is pretty close. You just don\\'t want to wander off in the wrong direction in that neighborhood. You want to walk in the direction the train was going when you get to the street at West Farms. There is a sign on the street pointing toward the zoo but it’s rather small. (#5 Can you really see the entrance from the subway? I don’t remember that).\\nThe subway is faster but the bus is a nicer ride and you get to see stuff on the way, although the subway is elevated for the last part of the trip too. If you decide to take the bus, tell the driver you want the Bronx Zoo stop. You will be on a highway for awhile, and the driver will leave you off at the bottom of a ramp. Walk to the end of the ramp, turn left, go through the underpass, and you will see the zoo entrance ahead of you. If you want to take the bus back, check return times because the last bus is rather early. If you take the subway one way and the bus the other way, you will need to use different entrances and exits, and it’s a big zoo so you should plan that in advance. They give you a map at the entrance that shows where the entrances are.\\nBe aware that you need to reserve tickets ahead of time, that you must wear a mask for the indoor exhibits, and starting September 13 you need to show proof of vaccination.\\nIt’s a great zoo—have fun! The zoo website mentions:\\nThe BxM11 express bus makes stops along Madison Avenue, between 26th and 99th Streets, then travels directly to the Zoo\\'s Bronx River entrance (Gate B). For your return trip, pick up the bus just outside the same gate at the MTA BxM11 sign (just before the underpass). Please note, fare for an Express Bus ride is $6.75 each direction.\\nAlso, avoid the \"free\" day (Weds.) when the zoo is unbearably crowded. I see they are now limiting admission on that day. The everything admission for adults is $40.\\nEdited: 6:35 pm, August 19, 2021 Has anyone flown on United to Europe ( Italy ) where a Covid test is required. I am a US citizen an they offer a link thru a service Trustassure but here in NJ some are affiliated with ACME Supermaket that has a Pharmacy that then sends the test to the lab. Seems like to many hoops with ACME if one step fails then you cannot depart. Has anyone used this site, or used a different provider and uploaded the results 72 hrs in advance? Appreciate any advice. Thanks Are you not vaccinated? You shouldn\\'t need a test if you have proof of full vaccination, though you will need to be tested to get back into US. You shouldn\\'t need one if you\\'re vaxxed I think, but for anyone looking at this-- CVS is free and they always get the results for their PCR test in at 11:00pm the day after the test, at least the times I had to do it there they did--and it\\'s free. Even though Canada has opened up their border to vaccinated US citizens, they still require a Covid test, presumably to prevent breakthrough infections from getting into Canada. So it\\'s not a given that if you are vaccinated & traveling that you don\\'t need a Covid test. It depends on the precautions the given entity is requiring. Italy requires testing for entry into the country only if you do not have proof of full vaccination. You can go to website of US embassy Rome to confirm this. It also has links to English versions of Italian laws. You are going to have a hell of a time doing anything in Italy without proof of vaccination as they now also require it to get into museums, restaurants, etc. Your only alternative over there, if you don\\'t have vax proof, is to get tested every day or two and carry negative proof around to get into places. In these circumstances I wouldn\\'t even bother going to Italy. All Thank you I am fully vaccinated for several months and have my certificate. But on the \"my requirements\" site for Untied it mentions a test is required? I do see now that all I need it Proof Of vaccination I guess does not do nay harm to get a test before I leave as extra proof. I flew to Italy on August 2 on an American “Covid-tested” flight. The Covid test was not required if you were vaccinated but I got one anyway (CityMD) because I was so anxious about all it so I know what you’re going through. No one asked about the Covid test; the CDC vaccination card was ok to get on the plane and at immigration in Milan, and at the hotel in Milan.\\nThe Green Pass requirement started a couple of days ago. I’m in a small town on the Adriatic and my first trip to a museum resulted in a lot of confusion because they weren’t used to the CDC card, but after some discussion it was ok. The second museum was more adamant but I showed them the ticket from the first museum and they called there and worked it out. The next day at the castle in a different small town: same thing. I’ve been explaining that Italian immigration let me into Italy with the CDC card, then showing my NYS Excelsior pass (digital and printed), then being patient while they figure out what to do. Everyone has been very polite and very apologetic when it’s all over. I also speak enough Italian to explain everything but if you’re in a major city they’ll know English.\\nIt will take awhile, especially in places that haven’t gotten many non-EU tourists yet, until everybody gets on board with this. There was a third small museum yesterday: no problem. I’m still anxious about upcoming events but hoping that it will work out. I haven’t tried indoors in a restaurant yet because everybody eats outdoors anyway.\\nEdited: 1:09 am, August 10, 2021 For Italy you will want to carry your proof of vaccination around with you since they won\\'t let you into a bunch of places without proof of vaccination or very recent negative covid test etc Keep in mind that the EU is going to decide this week whether or not to ban american tourists. Who knows if Italy will follow the EU recommendations if it goes that way but they may. Am cautiously thinking about a trip to NYC for Easter 2022 (we were supposed to be there July this year)\\nI have searched back previous threads and it looks like many things would still be open on Easter Sunday. It would only be a 4/5 night trip and I am keen not to have any lost days. But we could plan things like the high line for this day.\\nHowever i’ ve not been able to work out if Broadway shows would still be open on Easter Sunday? I believe Monday is usually the dark day? Thank you Many things stay open for Easter Sunday. Some stores close. Some shows may have an Easter matinee. Easter Monday doesn,t exist here, it\\'s a regular day. Broadway shows run on an 8 shows a week schedule. The standard weekly run is to do 5 evening shows Tues - Sat & matiness on Wednesday. Saturday & Sunday. However, producer\\'s can & do set their own schedules & schedules can & do change on holiday weeks. Almost nothing closes on Easter in NYC. Pretty much everything should be open. If you will be there the days leading up, be prepared for crowds! Many kids have spring breaks that week so the more kid friendly activities can get very busy. If you aren\\'t traveling with kids,never mind. :) Thank you , It would be me and my 16yr old daughter.\\nWe’re tied to school holidays so Easter works well for us as my husband would be off work so my son would not be home alone.\\nI don’t dare book from the U.K. at the moment but I realise I’ll need to book everything in advance as much as possible. This trip was supposed to be on her 16th birthday, it will actually be much nearer her 17th by the time we go!! Hi!\\nI am planning a trip to New York for April. We\\'re bringing 2 kids, ages 12 & 14. None of us have ever been to New York, so we were wondering if there were any things we should do that I probably haven\\'t heard of before. If you have restaurant recommendations, that would be great too! We were planning on staying at the Arlo Midtown and getting subway passes. Any thoughts about that hotel for us? We wanted something nice (but not too fancy) at a price that isn\\'t ridiculous (preferably under $300 a night, but with some wiggle room), with location being a major priority. It seems like the Arlo fits that bill, but if there are any other hotels you think we\\'d prefer, please let us know!\\nI know none of this is very specific (because we haven\\'t done too much planning considering the trip is so far in the future) but wanted to see if you had any thoughts. Just let us know what some of your favorite things are! Thank you! Even though your trip is far in the future, I would get a guidebook & at least give it to the kids & have them do the preliminary planning with your input, of course. The rooms at the Arlo Midtown (actually all of them) are incredibly small. Do you plan to get 2 rooms? If not, I think there are far better options for 4 people. Can the kids share a bed? There are several other threads from today discussing hotels with rooms for 4 people including some with 3 beds if the kids can’t share. You say location is a priority and you’re probably assuming you should be near Times Square which is not necessary.\\nIt¡s impossible to tell you what you haven\\'t heard of since we don,t know what you have heard of.😆\\nThere,s a lot of info on the extreme right column here titled “ Top questions about NYC”. There may be a better hotel for you or not. Why do you feel this hotel is the location for you?\\nOn the other hand , I don’t agree that all the rooms are “incredibly small “at the Arlo Midtown. But I guess it depends on what ones definition of Incredibly small.\\nWhat type of room did you reserve?\\nThey have a two double bedded room that is 320 ft.² Thats a good size IMO.\\nbooking.com often shows square footage of rooms.\\nEdited: 11:32 pm, August 17, 2021 The 320sf room is an accessible room. The regular 2 double rooms are 200sf, small for 4 people with barely enough space to walk around the beds. A hotel with 2 queen beds would be better...or even 2 queens and a sofabed. Hilton Garden Inn Times Square, Hampton a inn Times Square North and the Pearl are some options just north of Times Square with 2 queen bed rooms. The facts are that There are different sized rooms at the arlo midtown.\\nThe 320 ft.² 2 double bed room Accessible room. Which in my opinion is fine for anybody if you can afford it.\\nA 240 square-foot 2 double bedroom with the terrace, if you can afford it.\\nAnd a king bed room (which won’t work for this OP) but for others\\nAssessable king terrace and regular king terrace both @ 320 ft.² Activities?\\nThe best way to get suggestions is to list what plans you have so far. Also, what are the teens interested in? They should definitely help with the planning.\\n-How long with you be visiting?\\n-Boys? Girls? One of each?\\n-Are they into tall buildings...as one poster recently stated about her 12 yr old(I believe)?\\n-Shopping?\\n-History buff(s)?\\n-Just want to walk around and take everything in?\\n-Sports?\\n-Museums?\\n-Foodies?\\n-Etc.\\nThere are thousands of things to do in NYC. Have the kids start to select \"must do/see\" attractions. Then the parents should also start a list. Maybe the same attraction will be on multiple lists. Maybe not.\\nThen start pricing out the attractions...if there is a cost. Then plot them out on a map or post in a new thread if you need help mapping. My wife, two teenagers and I stayed several times at the Westin Times Square and the Sheraton (at 52nd and 6th). We were comfortable and the location was good. Hopefully you will be out and about and only sleeping in the room.\\nA good compact inexpensive handy Guidebook is Top Ten New York. You can start with reading about the Top Ten places and then drill down into various top ten lists and neighborhoods.\\nNew York City implemented a proof of vaccination policy this week. So if you are not vaccinated I almost would say don’t come to New York because you will not be able to enter restaurants, stores, museums, Broadway and other shows, etc.\\nGood luck with your planning. Thanks so much for everyone\\'s responses! I really appreciate it. The kids are probably going to sleep on the same bed so that shouldn\\'t be a problem. I\\'m looking closely into your hotel suggestions to find something a little bigger. Again, I appreciate all these suggestions.\\nWe\\'re staying from April 6-10 (hopefully that\\'s enough time). They are both boys. None of us are that into shopping, we mostly enjoy walking around and taking in the city. We\\'re all foodies as well. Museums could be interesting (none of us are into art although I\\'d be open to any type of museum). Our main goal is just to explore the city and see what it has to offer. We\\'re all vaccinated so that shouldn\\'t be a problem :).\\nThank you! Really it was awesome post and very excellent place for visiting...New York is the iconic, trend-setting city that never sleeps. Book your stay at Warwick New York to begin exploring the city attractions, shopping, events everything is very clear cut dependency...\\nThank you The museum of Natural History is very popular with kids. It was featured in the movie “Night at the Museum.” It\\'s easily. combined with Central Park. The Metropolitan a museum has world class art but also has a lot of other things like arms and armory, musical instruments and even whole rooms of historic furnishings.\\nMetmuseum.org\\n2 sites that are good for self guided walking tours\\nWalkingoffthebigapple.com\\nFreetoursbyfoot.com Hi there,\\nI am travelling to New York for NYE this year with my family. I have been trying to search online for a restaurant which either has a view of the NYE fireworks, or, is close to somewhere we can stand to see the fireworks. Times Square will be too hectic for us so we are not looking there. I have seen The Boathouse is a good option however just trying to find other options also! If any are child friendly also that would be amazing!\\nAlso any recommendations for family friendly restaurants for normal evenings, and not NYE will be amazing!\\nThanks in advance.\\nCharlotte. The Ball drop in Times Square is by Father Duffy Square but it is only visible points north of there on Broadway & 7th Ave up to almost 52 nd St.\\nYou can call Olive Garden, and see if the are planning anything yet. It may be difficult as know one knows what the future of the pandemic will be (we all hope to put it behind us, but it seems to be here to stay) Ellen’s Stardust Diner didn’t have a direct view, but used to have a party then let everyone out at Midnight to see the Ball Drop. It was a more affordable fun way that put you in Times Square at midnight without waiting(bathroomless) in the cold for hours. You can check Ellen’s website from time to time to see if they decide to re open.\\nHope this helps. Enjoy & Stay safe\\nEdited: 1:15 pm, August 19, 2021 NYE fireworks are not really a big deal but they are shot off over Central Park and are visible from many locations without the kinds of crowds you get on the Fourth of July.\\nNow, if you want to see the Ball Drop, that takes a ton of work and/or money In (almost) every past year there has been an outdoor event that has a good chance of being held this year: a bike ride to the Central Park fireworks. The event is FREE and perhaps the BEST NYE party in NYC celebrated with thousands of local New Yorkers in the open spaces of Central Park.\\nThis is an annual event that in past years has started in the heart of Greenwich Village at 10:00 PM at Washington Square Park (under the arch) to bike or rollerblade to the Belvedere Castle in Central Park (by 11:45 PM) for music, dance, and fireworks to ring in the New Year. Participants are encouraged to dress festively.\\nFor more information as it becomes available see:\\nhttp://times-up.org/calendar/calendar.php\\nAnd if you decide to forego the bike ride, just come to the general area of the Belvedere Castle in Central Park.\\nCH\\nEdited: 4:49 pm, August 19, 2021 My husband and I will be renting bikes from a cycling store and plan to cycle around Manhattan on the Greenway. It looks like there are some areas where the Greenway is not continuous and we will need to ride on the streets. We also plan on crossing the Williamsburg Bridge to ride in Brooklyn and after a little exploring cross back into Manhattan on the Brooklyn Bridge. Having never done this is there anything that we should be aware of or any advise for this trip?\\nEdited: 5:38 pm, August 18, 2021 You will have to detour via the streets around the UN buildings on the east side, for security reasons. The northern end might have some funny bits too, but mostly the rest will be good. The occasional construction work, but it\\'s a great ride.\\nMake time to stop along the way and take pictures, it\\'s quite scenic on both sides of the river. I would suggest heading south down the west side and heading north up the east side. On the west side you\\'ll have to new WTC buildings coming into view as you ride south, then on the east side you\\'ll have some great vistas of the ESB as you head north.\\nEdited: 6:01 pm, August 18, 2021 I have done this and it was my all time favorite vacation day. No advice just enjoy the ride.\\nIf you have a 2nd day you might go to Queens and bike over a bridge to Roosevelt island. The views of Manhattan are incredible\\nEdited to add: we started our Manhattan day with a free bike tour of Central Park. ( at the end you tip what you wish)\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/nyc-bike-tours/#schedule\\nEdited: 6:40 pm, August 18, 2021 Have you ridden in city settings before? Are you prepared to deal with traffic and aggressive drivers? I personally would think twice about any bike ride around the city if I wasn\\'t pretty well familiar with where I was going and what the situation was like at every step.\\nYou could be facing risky situations, but not having done this myself I can\\'t advise other than to beware. @Linda5jwink- there is a dedicated bike path for most of the route. It is very doable with normal bike safety cautions They\\'re asking about where it\\'s on regular streets. I\\'m giving my local opinion as a Staten Islander frequently in Manhattan, who would only ride my bike there on Sundays or holidays.\\nEdited: 7:20 pm, August 18, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 7:19 pm, September 10, 2021 I’ve never done a full circuit of Manhattan so can’t advise on the unconnected portions of the Greenway. I can say that I do ride in Manhattan semi-regularly, sticking to bike lanes wherever possible. I’m hyper-alert to vehicles and don’t assume that they see me. I also don’t assume that pedestrians will not step into the bike lane in front of me. Don’t hesitate to use your bell. Also, be alert to other cyclists who may be passing you or directly behind - no sudden stops, no veering to avoid debris.\\nThose are the cautionary notes. On the positive side, biking is a great way to experience the city, and on many major bike routes, you’ll see tons of other cyclists - numbers being key to cyclist safety.\\nFor a Brooklyn jaunt - I’d personally avoid biking over the Brooklyn Bridge - too much congestion on the mixed-use path - unless the new bike lane on the roadway is open at the time of your visit. Stick to the Williamsburg and Manhattan bridges (on the Manhattan Bridge, be careful with the steep and tightly curved approaches on both ends).\\nThere’s a mostly-protected, extensively used bike route that runs along Kent Av in Williamsburg and then hugs the Navy Yard. If you’re ambitious, the waterfront Red Hook neighborhood makes for a fun & scenic bike destination. (Though the block-paved streets there & in DUMBO/Vinegar Hill are not friendly to road bikes.)\\nFinally - if you haven’t already, make use of the NYCDOT bike map for trip planning. You can find it here:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bikemaps.shtml\\nHappy cycling! -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 7:18 pm, September 10, 2021 Please make sure your rental includes a helmet, or buy one - no matter how good your bike skills are. Our roads aren’t all well paved, and pedestrians and cars aren’t always respectful of bikers. Not going to share the horror stories, but suffice to say, I make this plea from the heart. With regards to exploring Brooklyn on the bike, this would be a good route if you want to minimize automobile contact and it will give you a good circuit of Northern BK.\\nAfter getting off the Williamsburg Bridge, goto the end of the plaza and make a left on S. 4th Street. Go three blocks and make a right on Berry Street. Berry Street is an open street, so cars are not allowed to travel along it. Just be mindful that pedestrians always have the right of way. Continue until the Bedford/Lorimer/Nassau triangle, which is a very lively and fun part of Greenpoint.\\nTo go back south, backtrack until Banker street and until Franklin and make a left on Franklin. You can take the bike path all along the Williamsburg waterfront. At Flushing Avenue make a right (the turn will be very obvious). If you are traveling between Wednesday and Sunday, take a break at the Naval Cemetery Landscape. Its one of those things that are a pain to get to without a bike and is a wonderful oasis in the city.\\nAt Navy Street (right after the Wegmans), make a right. This will put you into Vinegar Hill, one of the most charming little places in Brooklyn. Make sure to visit the Admiral\\'s House. From there you ride along empty streets to DUMBO and at that point you can take the bridge back to Manhattan.\\nThere are tons of places along the way for drinks and nibbles, but if you are willing to ride a bit farther, I\\'d suggest the Brooklyn Beer & Ale Company up by Ash Street (access it by riding along Franklin. Manhattan Avenue is too hectic for a biker not used to it). They have a bike rack out front, all their beers are local and their rooftop is a great place to hang out.\\nEdited: 11:54 am, August 19, 2021 I have read \"some\" are staying away from some Broadway shows given the current Covid situation.\\nHas anyone heard of Springsteen on Broadway tickets selling (in advance or at \"last minute\") for less than face value?....if so, might there be a reputable agency or website you can recommend (if not comfortable sharing on this public forum I would welcome a private message).\\nThanks\\nEdited: 10:21 am, August 19, 2021 Seatgeek is the official seller for the show. I don’t know if you would call them the official “re-seller” for the show, but anyone I know (including in the Springsteen fan groups on FB) is reselling or buying through seatgeek.\\nSomeone just posted on fb that they randomly went to the box office and asked and the box office was able to get them seats for the next night.\\nThere’s only rare incidences of selling below face from, what I’ve seen. I saw one posting that said that someone had several seats and re-sold them so was taking less than face for the last one, a single. If you can, join one or more Facebook fan groups for timely info of people selling directly. Otherwise, seatgeek is the reliable source.\\nEdited: 10:49 am, August 19, 2021 Btw, I went on Tuesday. I saw it 4 times pre-Covid and the friend I went w had seen it 8 times pre-Covid. We both loved it just as much. Bruce had me hanging on his every word. I cried twice when he was talking about his parents. He changed up 3 songs. He is just brilliant.\\nEdited: 10:52 am, August 19, 2021 just showing up a couple hours pre showtime might work. I know all the House Seats aren\\'t getting sold, but they are pricey at Face Value True, NT.\\nThere was an open seat in front of my friend (but a huge huge guy in front of me, unfortunately - who kept putting his arm around his wife and taking it off, disrupting my view regularly). The guys to the right of the open seat said they got their last minute tix on seatgeek. Thanks for the tips… I’m on the fence about shelling out $500-800…might try showing up and negotiating with someone who has an extra (stranger things have happened—I once, successfully, bribed a NYC cop to get me inside MSG to see The Who in the late 70s; I ended up standing the entire show but “who cared”). Waiting outside a venue for a cheap ticket has worked for me if you wait for the last mintie, Ive never tried for a broadway show, but I have done that for a sporting event (Once the event starts the tickets become almost worthless) I once paid $10 to see the second half of a Knicks game (and they were getting their butts kicked) and other time time $2 for a Mets game after the 2nd inning Broadway tickets are selling very slowly , Hamilton has tickets available for almost every show from Sept until June 2022, Wicked and the Lion King are also full of tickets to sell\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/fh5xhsvw Most people knew that things were going to be tough until tourism picks up again. Some are expecting lots of closures in January. I have a trip planned for late October but I\\'ve only bought tickets to 3 shows. With the uncertainty of the 4th wave, boosters and lack of discount codes, I\\'m waiting to buy tickets for the other 5 shows.\\nMany shows are offering free refunds so that complicates matters. By the way, the dates that I looked at there were between 20-30 tickets available for Hamilton so it\\'s not like they are going to be losing money (just not the crazy demand they had pre-covid). What George said.\\nPlus, with the US borders closed to those of us from EU countries, the demand for tickets from our target group clearly won\\'t pick up until it\\'s possible traveling to NYC again. thanks for the info. Maybe it\\'s finally time for some of us locals to see Hamilton. I\\'m seeing Hamilton on Halloween which is a great day to get theater tickets for anything. The reality isn there arent many tourists, especially ones from overseas and the ticket prices are too high for most locals and with mask mandates , Vaccone checks and Delta variant, the people who can afford it just decide its not worth the hassle (This is not a comentary on masks, but many people will decdide its not worth it to spend $400-$500 to sit for 3 hours wearing a masks, even for Hamilton or Wicked , they will wait until they can see it when it safer and you dont need a mask) I wouldn\\'t mind taking precautions if I knew that I would be safe but I don\\'t trust that the virus is being taken seriously just yet. Maybe, but on the other hand, theaters requiring vaccines and masks actually makes me more inclined to go to a show right now. There are also plenty of shows that have tickets for way less than $400. One of the knocks on Scalping is that it causes people to pay above face value ticket prices, but what detracters dont realize it can cause prices to be below face value, If they tickets arent selling at the current prices, they need to lower them. Alot of people cannot afford $250 a ticket for Hamilton or wont pay $500 (for 2 tickets) to wear a mask for 3 hours, but they might be $50 a ticket willng to pay theaters may be requiring vaccines and masks but plan on opening at 100% with no social distancing in place. and if the numbers should rise in the fall and Broadway remains closed do they have a guaranteed refund policy in place? last year a Billy Joel concert was rescheduled over and over again, and it took 3 months to get a refund; service, processing and delivery fees are not refunded, which is a lot of money if you’re holding multiple tickets. This thread has given me food for thought. I\\'ve got a trip booked, from the UK, in March 2022. Who knows whether the borders will be open by then? That\\'s a whole other issue. I was wondering whether it was worth taking a chance and booking Broadway tickets now, before international visitors are back and demand ( and prices) inevitably rise.\\nWhat do the Broadway experts think?\\nI want to see Girl from the North Country ( I had tickets in March 2020, but of course didn\\'t make it, and got a refund.) The show opens again in October. I\\'m double jabbed and will most likely have had a booster jab by March, so not worried about theatre restrictions. If there are still Covid travel restrictions in March, all bets are probably off anyway in terms of my trip - but what if the show closes before March? Would refunds for tickets purchased be given?\\nGrateful for any advice, comments or suggestions. West Indian Day Parade Cancelled too\\nhttps://bronx.news12.com/west-indian-american-day-parade-postponed-until-september-2022 It is too bad these popular events have been canceled, but the virus situation is not good.

Hi, everyone!\\nI read somewhere that you couldn\\'t buy an unlimited 7-day Metrocard while getting off JFK AirTrain, and that you had to buy a pay-per-ride card. I want to get a 7-day pass, so does this mean I will need to get 2 Metrocards, one pay-per-ride and one unlimited, or will I be able to \"add\" the 7-day pass to the Metrocard I bought for the AirTrain.\\nHopefully this makes sense. I appreciate all your help!\\nThank you! Don\\'t think you can select a 7 day unlimited pass when you buy the metrocard initially for the air train. Don\\'t think it is an option on those machines. What you can do is get the card for the air train and then when you get to the subway put that card in the machine and add a 7 day unlimited pass. Unlimited rides do not include air train fare. That will always come off the cash part of the card.\\nEdited: 12:06 am, August 16, 2021 After a little bit more digging, it seems like you can\\'t add an unlimited 7-day pass to a Metrocard you buy at the AirTrain station. On this forum I\\'m linking below, it says to buy one at a Hudson Newsstand at the airport. The article is pretty outdated, so is this still a good idea, or is there a better way?\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k10017164-Unlimited_7_Day_Metrocard_and_JFK_AirTrain-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThank you! Hmm then I guess all you can do is ask at the newsstand. I always had my own metrocard so never had this issue. I don\\'t know if they changed the air train metrocards since then. Seems stupid. If this is the case then you will need two metro cards unless you just wanted to put straight cash on your air train card. Yes you need two separate cards, the air train isn’t included in the 7 day unlimited (the air train is considered a special ride and is more expensive than the usual subway or bus fare) so you need two cards, if you actually need the unlimited. Make sure the 7 day is worth it for you. If you are in midtown and walk to most things but only need two or three round trips down town or to Brooklyn then you will save by just putting money on one card that you can use for the AirTrain& your round trips. The unlimited is really for someone using the card more than three times a day for the whole seven days. I kind of feel like people over pay for that a lot and only need maybe two round trips if they are Mobile and plan well. Whatever you decide enjoy & stay safe!\\nEdited: 9:58 pm, August 17, 2021 Yes don\\'t know when you are coming, but unless it is the dead of winter you may not want to be using the subway that much (unless you are staying in an outer borough and need to commute in and out every day- still even then you might not need the subway that much). NYC is very walkable, especially if you do minimal planning to group the sights you want to see together in the same time frame.\\nEdited: 10:45 pm, August 17, 2021 Can confirm that you can’t get the 7 day unlimited pass while getting off the air train. Was just there last week and was confused that it wasn’t an option. You don\\'t need two physical cards, but you can\\'t use a 7 day pass on the Air Train, which I assume is why you can\\'t add it to your card when you buy or fill your card at an Air Train station. All you should need to do is get a card at the machine and when going through the Air Train, put enough money on it for the Air Train, then when you go down to the subway station, go to one of the machines and put a 7 day pass on it. You don\\'t need to buy two separate cards. There have been previous posts reporting that it isn\\'t possible to add a 7 day unlimited pass to a metrocard purchased at the Airtrain. See #8 in this thread posted by zephyr18:\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k10574840-Metrocards_and_AirTrain-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nI believe it\\'s because the Airtrain is operated by the Port Authority of NY/NJ, while the subway is operated by the MTA. Hi, my husband and I will be coming at the end of August and I\\'m torn between 3 hotels. Mostly because of the reviews. Some are great and some awful and I\\'m not sure what to believe. The 3 I\\'ve narrowed down to are the Westin New York at Times Square (43rd at 8th), Hilton Garden Inn Times Square (8th Ave & 48th) and the Millennium Hotel Broadway Times Square.\\nDoes anyone have any experience at any of these? Or any other suggestions, we\\'d like to stay at around or under $200/night. Also, is it worth it to pay for a higher floor? I feel like we\\'ll be out so much, not sure if we \"need\" a super view or not.\\nThank you! Are you set on Times Square? Because there are a lot of great neighborhoods with possibly better hotels. And, it\\'s fun to try some unique hotels vs generic Hilton types. :) Honestly, not really! Just going by a friends recommendation. Since it\\'s our first time in NYC, I figured Times Square would be sort of central to what we want to see and we\\'ll be going to the St James Theater as well. But I\\'m always open to ideas! The Westin is the nicest of those 3 but very near Port Authority and there\\'s been a problem with homeless in that area. The Millenium is tired....in need of renovation. The HGI is fine but nothing special. Look at the M Social and see if it fits your budget. Also check Courtyard Central Park and Residence Inn Central Park.\\nAs for reviews, concentrate on most recent ones (a lot of places that were fine before the pandemic are not now, either because they\\'re short staffed or weren\\'t maintained.. worry about things that would/should bother you like cleanliness.\\nEdited: 6:07 pm, August 09, 2021 How many nights are you staying? If it’s only two or three nights it might be the best idea to stay in the area of the St. James theater. But, Otherwise you can stay anywhere and take a taxi or the subway.\\nWhat are your other plans?\\nAs for hotel reviews, it can get confusing we all know that. Try to focus on recent reviews &what’s important to you, Whether it be service, room size, amenities, a bright room , storage. No Slow elevator etc.\\nTo me, location is the very most important thing.\\nPersonally, I think you should NOT choose a hotel right in the middle of times Square unless you like it Bright and hectic. For a short trip I would choose one to east of the st james theatre. East of 6th ave.\\nI suggest putting your dates into TA then look at hotels on a map.\\nThen you have start over with reading reviews.sorry. 😔\\nAdditionally if you give us your exact dates and Budget ( $200 is the max before tax or after?) some may search hotels for you.\\nGood luck. Thank you for all of the suggestions, we will check out a couple other places. We are staying for 6 nights. We plan to visit Central Park a couple times, 9-11 memorial, Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, Coney Island, Empire State, walk the Brooklyn Bridge and also take a day to visit Asbury Park. If we have time, a day at one of the beaches, Staten Island Ferry and maybe Governors Island. I agree the Westin may be the nicest of those hotels, but maybe not in best part of that neighborhood, at least not right now. That HGI on 8th and 48th has been there for a really long time. Years ago it was, I think, a Days Inn with a pool on the roof. I once worked nearby and used to look down on the pool from my office and sometimes wish I could be there. Hilton then bought it, renovated it and got rid of pool. People seem to generally like it. I think it\\'s a good location, a block or so west of north end of Times Square (which is fortunately not busiest part of Times Square), so near TS, but not in it. Also convenient for theaters, a variety of dining options and public transit.\\nEdited: 7:25 pm, August 09, 2021 I stayed at the Westin a few times but it has been years. I always had good stays there. I second the above recommendation to check out the Courtyard or Residence Inn Central Park, though they may be above budget. Close to TS but further from the Port Authority which right now is a good thing. Still good transit links and close to Central Park. Just to throw another hotel into the mix, The Benjamin is in Midtown (east) and is having an Endless Summer promotion with discounted rates for certain dates. I don\\'t know your exact dates so don\\'t know if the rate is within your budget, but you could take a look.\\nThat rate is refundable, cancellable up to 48 hours before check-in and is 30% off the regular rate.\\nhttps://www.thebenjamin.com/offers/endless-summer/ Hi, any thoughts on a couple of other hotels here...Crowne Plaza HY36 Midtown or the Iroquois? I actually ended up reserving M Social, thank you NYWhiz, and it\\'s fully refundable before we leave so I was looking at other areas too. All 3 of these have pretty decent reviews and I got a great deal on M Social, just wondering if the other 2, although a little more expensive, are better. Thanks in advance! I would prefer M Social to either of the other 2. The Crowne Plaza Midtown would put you closer to Penn Station for the concert and if going to Asbury Park, but I don\\'t care for that location and think M Social has better restaurants nearby, is closer to Central Park and has bigger rooms. The Iroquois rooms are quite dark..it,s an old building, not very tall and you either face an interior courtyard or the front. If they were cheaper and you were looking to save money I,d say ok. But for more money, I\\'m not sure you’re gaining much. My husband and I want to go to the US Open on Saturday September 9th to watch the women\\'s final and am wondering if it\\'s possible to buy tickets once we get there. Maybe from a scalper on the sidewalk. Would you do that?\\nThe event usually sells out from the official seller, have you checked buying that way?

We bought scalped tickets in London for the ATP and they were awesome.. we may try it there, fingers crossed Hi there\\nAnyone any suggestions for hotels with interconnecting rooms in a good central location, 4 star standard please.\\nSuites aren’t an option as it’s 2 adults with a 19 and 14 year old and interconnecting rooms work great for us.\\nThanks in advance What is your budget in US $ including 15% tax? What do you mean by a central location? Usually we say that location can be irrelevant except for getting a hotel near a subway station especially one that serves multiple lines because things are really spread out. Some hotels have separate rooms, but a door in the hallway that can close off two rooms from the general hallway. When different guests are using the two rooms, this hallway door is simply left open. From personal experience, I can say that it\\'s not generally easy to tell which hotels have rooms that interconnect. My best advice is to identify a handful of hotels that look interesting to you -- the cost of 2 rooms is in budget, you like the location, etc -- and then email them to ask if they have rooms that connect.\\nI know that the Hyatt Union Square has interconnecting rooms, and that is a convenient location -- near a major subway hub, and lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, as well as a number of parks and attractions.\\nGood luck! Why wouldn\\'t a 2 bedroom suite be an option? Connecting rooms are always a request but never a guarantee so bear that in mind. Just to add... connecting rooms may be available at certain hotels \\'but never guaranteed when booking online\\', make sure you book directly with the hotel and have it clearly in your reservation! The Affinia Gardens and the Beacon hotel are 2 that have 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suites. Homewood suites midtown Manhattan has connecting suite rooms. Thank you all for your replies. Very helpful. I hadn’t even thought of 2 bedroom suites. That would probably be our preference now. I will get busy researching based on the advice received. Thanks again. Keep in mind, there a few, if any, “true” 2 bedroom suites in the city (I’ve looked for years). Doubletree Times Sq (which recently closed) used to be the best option because it had a separate bedroom with a door and a pull out in the L.R. Homewood suites has a slight partition between bedroom and living room, but it doesn’t close off (check the online photos). I do know you can get connecting suites there, though, because I’ve booked.\\nNot sure how many nights you are staying, but an Airbnb or VRBO might work better if it’s at least 3 nights. I travel to the city every year for a “girls getaway,” and we’ve done both apartments and hotels at various times. Some good apartments in the Hell’s Kitchen area.\\nGood luck.\\nEdited: 8:02 am, August 18, 2021 #9 - \"Not sure how many nights you are staying, but an Airbnb or VRBO might work better if it’s at least 3 nights.

Hi, we’re planning a trip to NYC next April and I have to say I really can’t choose a hotel. It’s likely that we will want breakfast in the hotel, to take the stress out of feeding my two teenagers first thing in the morning but then if we don’t like the food I guess I’m stuck, originally I thought Times Square but as long as there are dining options I don’t mind, in terms of itinerary, the usual guest timer stuff, any help with hotels and/or places for breakfast much appreciated Skip hotel breakfast, they\\'re typically not that great to begin with. So many options from on the go to full sit down, you\\'ll never go hungry here.\\nAs far as hotels, budget dictates where you choose to stay, etc. What is your budget per night, do you have exact dates? Bedding needs are as important as budget. Are there 4 of you? Can the teens share a bed or do you need 3 beds? I agree hotel breakfasts are usually not great, but it does make it easier with hungry teens. The typical NYC hotel room for 4 will only have 2double beds (doubles not so comfortable to share) but there are hotels with 2 queens or 2 queens plus sofabed.\\nHampton inns and Residence Inns are 2 chains that include breakfast in the room rate. If you need 3 beds, the Residence Inn Wall st. Has some rooms with 2 queen beds (like your kings) and a sofabed. That location will put you near the 9/11 Museum, the ferries to the Statue of Liberty, the Oculus, One World Trade Center, the Brooklyn Bridge and lots of restaurants.\\nThe Affinia hotels don\\'t include breakfast but many of the rooms have kitchens or kitchenettes and some will have the 2 queen and sofabed setup. Thanks, we will need three beds for sure even if that means 2 rooms, we were thinking 13 April for 7 nights but many thanks for this so far Adding to the \"don\\'t let the breakfast dictate hotel choice\" choir. If it\\'s included in the one you decide to book, fine. If not, breakfast places are plenty all around town for both sit down meals and quick grab and go places. Hi, have just come across this thread as thinking about moving our Florida holiday to NYC at the beginning of next April (hoping we can travel to US then). We will also be further timers and would need 2 queen beds at least. We will get breakfast out so am i better looking at the Affinia chain or are there any others fairly central? Therevjustvseem so many hotels and like op I can\\'t choose 🙂 Thank you Please delete your answer & start your own thread so that the answers to your thread don\\'t get mixed in with the original poster. Thanks. I agree with NYwhiz One has to consider their budget and their bedding needs first when choosing New York City hotel.\\nI think ,as its your the first time visiting Examining a map of New York City is essential. —-Starting with Manhattan as this is where most touring is done ,especially on your first visit.\\nLook at all your hotel considerations (within your criteria ) on a map. You can do this on TripAdvisor and Google maps as well.\\nThen read reviews of each hotel. On google you can place the destinations that you want to visit, Learn the best way to get there and the distance in relation to your hotel choices. This is what I do every time I go especially when I was new and didn’t know where things were located already.\\nRobbowen, As for breakfast, I personally would not choose a hotel because of breakfast but I don’t have teenagers. It’s a decision you will have to make but there are plenty of places to eat all over , from sit down places to grab and go.\\nWhen you narrow down your choices of hotels this forum can help locate breakfast , if needed. Some other hotels that would have 3 beds\\nCourtyard Midtown East - 2 queens and sofabed\\nBest Western Hospitality has suites with 2 queens and sofabed and I think includes breakfast Does anyone know if CLEAR keeps an office at Madison Square Garden when there are no active events at MSG, where you can go to complete enrollment if you don\\'t want to do it at the airport or are the clear people only there during designated event times?

Whenever we need a COVID test in NYC, we go to the City MD Urgent Care on 14th Street (between 5th & 6th Avenues), but there are MANY locations. Here is more information:\\nhttps://www.citymd.com/\\nCH @#4 Is that an RT-PCR test? There are City MDs all over the city that offer both PCR and rapid tests. Rapid test results come back in about 20 minutes. PCR tests can take up to a couple of days, but the last couple of times I\\'ve gotten one they\\'ve been less than a day. They have tons of locations throughout the city, you can look them up here: https://www.citymd.com/ Yes, Red, PCR and rapid tests.\\nCH My understanding is that RT-PCR is a specific type of PCR test. Apparently there is more than one kind and some airlines are extremely specific about what they will accept. It isn\\'t a rapid test. Hi,\\nMe n my wife will be visiting NYC and staying for 3 nights in first week of Sept 2021. We\\'re torn between downtown and midtown. We plan to visit 9/11 museum, walk Brooklyn Bridge to Dumbo, Central Park (not all but partial of the park), Statue of Liberty. Our budget is between $100 - $130 per night. No need for fancy hotel, but safe and comfortable to stay for the nights. Any recommendation for hotels would be greatly appreicated.\\nthanks. Your budget is probably too low for any decent hotel. Have you checked prices for your dates? Keep in mind taxes add 15% to prices and some hotels also charge a resort fee.\\nAll of the things you list except Central Park are downtown in the financial district and it\\'s usually less expensive in hotels .there. See what you find and check back here to make sure it\\'s legal and decent. Since you have a bunch of downtown activities planned, staying downtown makes sense to me. But your budget is very very low. I think you won\\'t have much choice in picking areas, you\\'d have to pick hotels that fit that budget to be honest. Have you tried doing a search on one of the third party hotel sites? That way you\\'d narrow it down to places that fit your budget. Ask here for input on those. PS if you plan to go to the Statue, you should book tickets in dance from the official seller\\nStatuecruises.com I travel to NYC a couple of times a year (except between March 2020 and present). I am returning for 8 nights the end of September. Hotel rates are slightly less currently than they have been, but staying either midtown or downtown don’t think I’ve ever paid less than $300/night (and often closer to $400 w/ taxes and fees). I typically stay in a Hilton, but have also tried some less known brands. I really don’t know if you can find anything decent for $150 or under.\\nGood luck. The US Open runs from August 30 - Sept 12. Prices will be higher during you dates due to demand.\\nEdited: 1:00 pm, August 16, 2021 What are your exact dates? I searched September 1 -4 and I found some very decent ones under $130 before taxes. I probably would stay downtown if I found a decent one in budget.\\nLook at the Holiday Inn lower Eastside, The Stewart , The Washington Jefferson hotel, pod 39.\\nEdited: 1:11 pm, August 16, 2021 Idid a google map search (plan to stay 9/6 -9/10) and the only one in my price range is Four Points by Sheraton New York Downtown and Fairfield Inn New York Manhattan/Financial District. But there are more choice between $135 - $160. I\\'ll take a look at some sites like Hotels.com or similar. Thank you all for your input.\\nEdited: 1:28 pm, August 16, 2021 Both those hotels have some reviews that would worry me. Don\\'t be pennywise and pound foolish (I.e. don\\'t stay in a dump to save $50. ) It is usually cheaper if you include at least 1 weekend night. Btw, you said 3 nights and those dates are 4.\\nEdited: 1:48 pm, August 16, 2021 oop sorry date 9/6 - 9/9. I read some bad reviews about those two as well. I\\'ll look at some other places. Thanks. Do you have a genius discount on booking.com?\\nWith that, the Stewart Hotel across from Penn station is a good deal for your dates September 6 of September 9 .\\none queen bed With resort fee and taxes comes to $385 total Does anyone know where I can get a Covid-19 PCR test with fast results for traveling in New York City? Sorry, no. I was able to get 24-hour results for a test ordered prior to a medical procedure by going to the hospital in question, but that wouldn’t be generally applicable. One of my relations got it last week. Got the results within 48 hours. Tell them that you need to travel.\\nhttps://www.newyorkdoctorsurgentcare.com/ Thanks so much! I haven\\'t tried them yet, called a bunch of other places. I will now!! They do indeed offer walk in covid19 PCR test, and with proof of travel, results within 48-72 hrs. In our case Test was done on Sunday afternoon and got results by Tuesday morning.\\nAlso, just wanted to add that at the Airport, the airlines (Emirates) did not allow many to board the flight without a PCR Test. Before Passport, they asked for a PCR COVID tests results. Will the airlines let me board if the results are on my phone in an email? Check with the airlines. I saw that they were fine as long it was a PCR test. On the web it says that it can take up to 7 days to get result, the same on some others webs. Can some body recommend a place where they guarantee result during 48 h for travel. @6 You don\\'t have the option of printing it out somewhere? I dunno if the airlines are collecting hard copies of test results for their records due to liability reasons or requirements of different governments. You can check with the airline to get a definitive answer. I got a covid19 rapid antigen test , through nasal swab procedure... will emirates accept it ? Its from\\nAn urgent care in Houston . The doctor also gave me a letter stating thats its a rapid PCR test . I realize this may be a question that no one can answer, but I thought it was worth a shot. I will be arriving tomorrow around noon. After watching the forecast for the last few days, tomorrow\\'s weather is looking better for some early afternoon sightseeing. With the chance of scattered thunderstorms later in the afternoon, if I were to book a ticket for Top of the Rock tomorrow, what would the chances be of visibility being good? Or would the overcast/cloudy skies make for even better photos? I won\\'t book the ticket until tomorrow sometime, either during my layover in DC, or once I get to the city. Cloudy skies make things tough for observatories in my opinion. As a tourist, you have to decide when you can fit it in if you did not go tomorrow. The weather for the next few days is not that promising.\\nI\\'m looking outside now and while it\\'s overcast, I can see out about a few miles in the distance. There are different levels of cloud cover, etc. For me, clear skies make for better photos, no doubt about it. It\\'s not a \"must-do\" for this trip, by any means. Just something I hadn\\'t done yet. I\\'ll plan to just play it by ear and see how the weather is when I arrive. You might take a look at the ESB live webcam to get an idea of current visibility conditions https://www.esbnyc.com/about/live-cam\\nThey\\'re only a little over a mile apart You dont have to pre-book tickets to Top of the Rock.\\nJust wing it and buy if the day looks good, they can handle crowds there and there arent many tourists here now Thanks, Kaye! I\\'ll definitely check that site out! We only had one opportunity on our schedule on our last trip and TOTR was a must do. It rained buckets every single day so it wouldn\\'t have mattered if we could have gone another time. While overcast, we still got some great pictures. Not as good as clear days but fine. I do think booking tickets is nice but just give your ideal dates and times a check to see how availability looks and decide from there.\\nFYI on their booking page it says \"If there is poor weather or visibility on the day of your visit, we will gladly reissue your ticket for a later time or date.\" Airport question: Is EWR or JFK preferred for flying in?\\nI was going to book a direct flight into EWR (from west coast), it would land at 5pm at EWR, on a Saturday (this is for a spring trip).\\nBut I\\'ve talked a folks who hate EWR and pay more to fly into one of the other airports so my other option is to fly into JFK but wouldn\\'t land until 8pm.\\nBoth flights are comparably priced and are direct flights.\\nDoes it matter? I initially chose EWR because it arrived earlier but I heard there is construction ongoing which has lead to numerous delays (beyond normal), the ride into Manhattan is much longer (worse traffic?), etc?\\nIf it matters, we are staying at Best Western Hospitality House (is that mid town East?)\\nWe are five people with luggage so plan on a car service to and from the airport.\\nFlying back to the west coast, we are actually flying out of JFK.\\nThanks! Based on your description, I would take the earlier flight into Newark. There’s construction everywhere…the airports, highways, etc. I would go with the more convenient flight. But if you ask ten people, you will get 12 responses (because two won’t be able to make up their mind).\\nEveryone has their own metrics for where they fly in and out of, and they’re all different. Preferred airline, ease of public transportation, direct flight, price, timing. Go with your gut. The trade offs aren’t big enough to stress about.\\nAlso, make sure your car service knows to send a big enough car for 5 people.\\nEdited: 9:08 pm, August 15, 2021 I have never liked Newark and avoid it when I can. However, I live on the east side of Manhattan and might feel different if I lived on west side.\\nHowever, note there is currently runway going on at EWR, expected to last until October or so, that has some people very upset -- e.g., CEO of United recently wrote to Port Authority or whoever is responsible expressing his dismay and detailing how disruptive and expensive it is every time UA has to cancel a long-haul flight on account of this, esp international flights. When outbound flight to Rome is canceled, inbound flight the next day also canceled, leaving hundreds of people on both sides of Atlantic wanting alternatives when there aren\\'t many, resulting in backlogs that can take several days to clear up.\\nI live near your hotel and always use JFK on long haul flights if it is an option.\\nEdited: 10:22 pm, August 15, 2021 If you are flying UA and they are quoting you higher fare fare for JFK, they have always done that. Also note that after abandoning JFK a couple yrs ago and moving all long haul to EWR, they only recently moved some CA flights back to JFK, apparently believing they were losing out on some profitable business traveler business. But it\\'s a limited number of flights at JFK, nothing like what they used to offer, so that may also have something to do with higher fare. It might depend on where you\\'re staying and thus how long it\\'ll take you to get from either airport to your accommodation, but I think both airports are equally fine. I actually generally prefer flying into/out of EWR because I like that trip a little bit more than to/from JFK, but there really isn\\'t a huge difference in my opinion. Both are totally fine airports. I agree with Risa, Newark is fine and gets you in earlier.\\nI fly out and back to Newark and have not seen any runway delays. Since you are staying midtown east do you not have an LGA flight option? I prefer LGA/JFK over EWR for the eastern side of Manhattan. That being said I have used all three multiple times. I\\'d probably opt for EWR so I can get in a few hours earlier and have dinner in NYC. I\\'ve always preferred Newark over JFK. Flying from west coast, like OP, there are generally no nonstops to LGA. Furthest most airlines fly from LGA is roughly DEN. Although if OP doesn\\'t mind connections, that is certainly an option.\\nOP is staying at hotel on E 49th St in midtown Manhattan. If they do fly into EWR I recommend getting fixed rate taxi/car service. Getting from west side to east side of Manhattan can be time-consuming torture, not to mention expensive on a meter. There is a LAX-LGA flight of course that is spirit airlines. Not an airline I would want to take on a cross country flight. The LGA perimeter rule doesn\\'t apply on Saturdays. EWR vs JFK really doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re staying in most parts of Manhattan.\\nLaguardia is slightly closer to the east side by car, but not nearly enough of a difference to be worth having to transfer or suffer through Spirit Airlines. Anyone travelled to America from England ?

I’m not seeing it anywhere.\\nDoes anybody have an update? Not exactly sure what you are looking for. Examples of places that are restricting unvaccinated people from entry?\\nYou are welcome. I don\\'t know if that is the same thing as the pass for gym, restaurants, etc, but it\\'s an app you can get from google or apple. The first link I found somewhere only had link to apple store so if you have Google go to play store. It\\'s really stupid. It\\'s just a frame for CDC card you probably already had many photos of. There is an.option to add official photo if you want. I found it awkward to use, but if it\\'s what they want .. By the way, my pass is called NYC COVID SAFE. I mention that because I had a devil of a time finding app in play store. I kept getting apps for all different states, but not this one. This may help you find it more easily. NYC\\'s New COVID Vaccine Passport Simply A \\'Glorified Photo Storage App,\\' Critics Say\\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/nycs-new-covid-vaccine-passport-simply-glorified-photo-storage-app-critics-say Why is NYC trying to have its own app? We have a state app that works pretty well and actually verifies vaccination status. Can\\'t wait until the mayor is gone. According to this article, the Key to New York City is not an app but just a compilation of mandates & a list of businesses that have agreed to abide by those mandates.\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/new-york-vaccine-passport/#:~:text=To%20fulfill%20the%20%E2%80%9CKey%20to%20NYC%20Pass%E2%80%9D%20policy,a%20digital%20vaccine%20passport%20like%20the%20Excelsior%20app.\\nEdited: 4:13 pm, August 16, 2021 #6 - The Excelsior pass can only access (& verify) the records of those vaccinated in NY State.\\nTo me it seems the city app seems intended for visitors but is of questionable utility & veracity\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/new-york-vaccine-passport/\\nEdited: 4:39 pm, August 16, 2021 It is required beginning today at some indoor places like gyms and restaurants. (You apparently can still sit outside to eat without proof). I don\\'t have whole list of types of places, and there may be additional places where it will be required in Sept. You can always show your paper CDC card or paper test results. This city app, like the state one, is just a way to store it electronically. I believe I heard the guy at the front desk at my gym tell someone you can also just take a photo of your proof with your phone and show them that. This afternoon they were also just waving in some people in who claimed they didn\\'t know about the new rule. My gym has struck me as rather careless & disorganized regarding a lot of COVID protocols, so other places could be more strict.\\nAlthough I haven\\'t seen lines in a couple months, over the past several days I have seen long lines outside an urgent care near me. Don\\'t know why that is, whether testing or vaccinations, or both. For vaccinations I thought it was easiest to just go to a pharmacy, but have heard anecdotally some are no longer getting regular shipments of vaccine. #8 I understand that and I also understand that people who can\\'t use the state app can still show their physical CDC card. What I still don\\'t understand is why the city felt the need to create yet another app that doesn\\'t verify anything. It just causes unnecessary confusion and feels like a mayor trying to get in front of the cameras yet again. Hi all,\\nI am heading to NYC for 10 days next week. When I go back to Hong Kong after the trip, I will need a rapid PCR negative results from a CLIA registered/certified testing site or lab. Do the testing facilities at JFK have CLIA certificates or CLIA registry (a CLIA number) for verification?\\nAlternatively, is there any COVID-19 testing sites in NYC that are CLIA certified and offer Rapid PCR testing for travel purposes?\\nMany thanks.\\nEdited: 1:18 am, August 17, 2021 Planning to go nyc and I would like to visit the Statue of Liberty, acces to the crown is allowed? Should o buy ticket just to liberty island or to the Ellis island too, what must see in nyc? From what I understand, the Crown is not currently open due to Covid. If you buy a ticket from Statue Cruises (which is the only way to step foot on Liberty Island & then step on the Pedestal, you buy a ticket for that which also includes Ellis Island.\\nThere is no one list of must sees & dos as there is so much to see & do & people vary widely. Get ahold of a guidebook & plan your trip. Asking anyone else, especially on an internet forum will give you an itinerary for someone else, not your. The Crown tickets are not available but you can buy Pedestal tickets which are still pretty good because you go into the statue and go up a few floors for the view.\\nThe museum on Liberty Island is also good and included in all tickets. Ranger tours are also included.\\nAll tickets include a stop at Ellis island where you can decide to visit, or just stay on the ferry and return to Manhattan. But it\\'s worthwhile to have a look even if it\\'s just for an hour.\\nThere are thousands of other things to see in NYC. This is a list of some of them: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-s409/New-York-City:New-York:First.Time.Visitors.html\\nStart planning and make your own personal list. Directly from the NPS website:\\nhttps://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm\\nYes, buy tickets in advance, the ferry goes to both islands.\\nMust see\\'s in NYC, look at the right side of the screen on a desktop or tablet, numerous threads on the subject. However, must see\\'s will vary from person to person, do some research and see what attracts you. I just met you on the Washington DC forum. Interesting. Are you doing a combined trip to New York City and Washington DC?\\nYou buy one ferry ticket. It stops at Liberty Island and Ellis Island. You can take the ferry from Battery Park or from Liberty Park New Jersey (my departure point since I live in New Jersey).\\nYou can buy a standard ticket or a Pedestal ticket which lets you visit the Pedestal of the Statue of Liberty. The Crown is closed.\\nI made a day trip in July and spent three hours at the Ellis Island Museum and two hours on Liberty Island. I did not visit the Pedestal.\\nI caught the first ferry at 9 am and it only had 20 people. By noon it was very crowded. I definitely recommend getting the first ferry.\\nIn terms of what to see in New York, “Top 10 New York” is an inexpensive book which should give you an excellent idea of what to see. You can buy “Top 10 Washington DC” for the Washington DC part of your trip. Both have 2020 editions. You can follow up from there by going to the websites of the places on your list.\\nGood luck with your planning. Yea I’m gonna spend 3 days in dc and 3 in nyc in nyc we planning to see the statue and World Trade Center observatory which I believe is 50 bucks per person other than that Central Park, Brooklyn bridge, time square and 911 memorial We planning to take bus or train from dc to nyc but we don’t know which one to take greyhound? Is there any others ones, and what kinda method of pay used in dc or nyc to use public transportation TIA I passed through the World Trade Center today. I was killing time before my entry time for the 911 Museum.\\nIt costs $43 if you wait in line and $63 if you want immediate entry. It did not appear to be busy. I would take AMTRAK between Washington DC and New York. The more in advance you buy your tickets the better the price.\\nIn both Washington DC and New York you can buy a “Metro Card” which is good for subways and buses.\\nIn both cities, you can buy a “Metro Card” from a machine which accepts either cash or credit cards.\\nPlease note on the subway there are some important differences.\\nIn Washington DC, you tap your Metro Card to enter and you must tap your Metro Card again to exit. The price per ride differs according to distance, zone and “peak” vs. “off-peak”.\\nIn New York City, you swipe your Metro Card to enter and the cost per ride is the same for each ride. The metro card is the same. For dc and nyc or I need to buy one card per city They are different. You need to buy one in each city. Visiting New York City in mid October my wife wants to say stay somewhere near times square I heard it\\'s real busy and hectic are there any recommendations for a good hotel or maybe in financial district? Do you have a budget? I have stayed at the Westin, Sheraton, Hilton Garden Inn near Times Square.\\nSince March 4, 2020 and the beginning of the pandemic, I have only gone to Downtown / Wall Street - July 2021 and today. 350 to400 a night with taxes and fees. What are your plans?\\nI see why people want to stay in Times Square, but it is a very busy area.\\nI recommend Union Square, the Village, Soho, or even the Flatiron District for starters. Conventional wisdom on this forum is that you should only stay in Times Square if you are doing theater marathons however I do these & I stay east or west of Times Square because I want to get out of the madness of theater crowds ASAP. Financial district is not near times square. If you want to be near times square, but not in the middle of times square look over at midtown east. It is a quieter area but within walking distance of times square. Still very central but not as hectic. City Center has announced a 2022 season for its \"Encores\" program -- starting with \"The Tap Dance Kid\" in February, then \"The Life\" in March, and ending with a two week run of \"Into the Woods,\" starring Sara Bareilles, in May. Hi,\\nMe, my wife and our 11-year daughter would be travelling from South America to India in May 2022 with a 12 hour layover at JFK i.e. we would be landing at 9am and departing at 9pm the same day.\\nI have a few questions about venturing out of the airport for about 7 hours (11am to 6pm):\\n1) Where can we go? Rockefeller Center, Empire State, Times Square, Central Park, Statue of Liberty are some of the sites that interest us. Considering travel time to and from airport, we may be left with about 5.5 hours! A couple of sites possible - or maybe a site and a nice lunch?\\n2) We would be having our luggage and would be better if we can stash it at some place within airport. What are our options there? We would be travelling on Qatar business class. Would the airline accept the baggage that early?\\n3) Any formalities required at the airport before venturing out for a few hours?\\nAny help/guidance/suggestions are more than welcome.\\nThank you. 1) it takes about 1 hour to get into Manhattan. Most airlines request you arrive 3 hrs. before flight time. If you look at the sites that interest you on Google maps you can see what\\'s near what. Going TO the Statue of Liberty is time consuming. You can easily pass by it on a cruise. Top of the Rock has great views and Rcok Center is walkable from Times Square. You could have time for most of your list depending on how long it takes you to get out of the airport and how convenient the baggage storage options are.\\n2) there are baggage storage facilities in several terminals.\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/jfk-luggage-storage/\\nI doubt the airline will take the luggage so early but you can ask.\\n3) the formalities include going thru immigration and customs. How long that takes depends on how many planes land at the same time. Hopefully Xovid will not put a wrench in your plans. This is what I would do\\nTake Airtrain/Lirr to Penn Station (About an hour)\\nWalk to Herald Square, You can see the Empire State Building from there\\nThen walk up Broadway to Times Square, Walk from times square to Rockefeler Center . Top of the Rock is there) you can See Central park and NYC Skyline from there\\nAfter Rockefeller Center walk to 7th Ave and 50th St and take the #1 train downtown to the Last Stop South Ferry. You can see Ellis Island , the Statue of Liberty and The Brooklyn Bridge from here .\\nNow Walk to WTC Area and see Occulus and 9/11 Memorial (about a 15-20 min walk from South Ferry) , After here get on the A Subway Train to far Rockaway at the Fulton St Station and get off at Howard Beach, At Howard Beach Transfer to JFK Airtrain (Allow 60 Mins for this ride) Thank you very much for your responses, nywhiz and howardforum.\\nI will try to cover Times Square and Top of the Rock.\\nWill check the airline policy about luggage and the baggage storage facilities.\\nThanks again. You won\\'t be able to check your luggage until 3 hours before your flight unless you are travelling on one ticket, in which case you just drop your luggage as soon as your clear Customs. 3) There are no transit zones in US airports so all international travelers have to go through customs and immigration at the first place they arrive in the US Thank you MeeMee.\\nYes, we would be travelling on a single ticket from Lima to Mumbai. Got it. Thanks Kaye_in_Astoria. I had a similar situation years ago. I stored the luggage at JFK and took a bus into Manhattan. It was mid-November and I expected chilly temps at 11am (Manhattan arrival time). Turns out, it was an 87F day and I so needed/wanted a t-shirt.\\nWalked into a Goodwill store and purchased a pair of used, washed shorts and a t-shirt. Felt so much better! Walked around 90 minutes and enjoyed a fabulous Thai lunch with family. They went back to work and I buzzed around until it was time to head back to JFK.\\nKnowing it took an hour in/out of Manhattan via bus made all the difference. I treated myself to a dinner takeout, which was scrumptious. Had a glass of wine with dinner on the plane and so loved my excursion into NYC. The next day, we landed in Singapore.\\nEdited: 7:42 pm, August 16, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 5:30 pm, August 22, 2021 Well, as you\\'re posting on the NYC forum, then NYC is probably going to win the vote.\\nI\\'ve been to both Cities, and it is easier for me to get to NYC from London, and I always love my time\\nOnly been to Seattle once, and want to revisit (same with Portland).

So disclaimer, you are posting in the New York forum so expect biased answers.\\nBut, if you haven\\'t been to New York yet, that\\'s definitely where you should go, for the following reasons:\\n1) It\\'s a lot closer to Cincinnati, you could even drive or take a train easily if you wanted(the cardinal actually passes through some beautiful wilderness in WV if you want to do that on the way back (the schedule on the way there is kind of weird))\\n2)NYC has more stuff to do, it\\'s just bigger and has more significant cultural and historical significance NYC during late August/early September is a nice time to visit(do expect posts that state that it will be warm/hot...in the summer.)\\nLoads of free things to do. Loads of places to eat where you don\\'t need to spend much. Attractions. History. Etc.\\nNYC by a landslide! Yeah, posting in both forums are going to get biased answers... I would say New York City. Just in Manhattan there is so much to see (and more compared to Seattle) . Since you’ve never been I would go To NYC first. Public transportation is easy and available, not so much in Seattle.\\nSeattle is a great place to see and tour as well but renting a car is probably necessary to see everything it has to offer.\\nWhen you do visit Seattle Rent-A-Car and plan to drive out of the city and see some of the natural beauty on west coast -re the Oregon and Washington coasts , the Olympic Peninsula and Cascade Mountains. NYC. done both multiple times and NYC wins out, Hi,\\nI plan to visit NYC and park at Impark (New York Wheel Parking Garage) which is near St George Ferry. I was able to park here twice before covid. Someone mentions that this garage is closing. Can someone in NY confirm this. I really appreciate it.\\nThanks. I don\\'t believe it is. I think you have to park at the outlet mall parking garage instead, which is actually closer and more convenient to the Staten Island Ferry, if that\\'s your destination. There\\'s also a parking garage a couple of blocks up the hill from the ferry, the courthouse garage. Thanks all. I see that outlet mall parking garage costs higher than New York Wheel garage, but it\\'s still lower than parking in Manhattan which I really don\\'t want to drive to. I think courthouse garage is not opened 24 hour, but I\\'ll double check. Outlet mall SI garage last I used it (2019) closed at 12 midnight. CaminoMundo you make a good point about doing anything on Staten Island: confirm that the place is actually open, and the hours are what you think they are. Many \"tourist attractions\" have limited days of operation, as well as hours. Don\\'t assume anything is the same as it was whenever the last time you were there. Also the public transportation from ferry, to train, to bus, is severely cut back on weekends, holidays, and even overnight. Not like the rest of the city at all. Right now the ferry is only running once an hour overnight, despite it literally being written into law that we have half hour service at a minimum.\\nEdited: 8:00 pm, August 13, 2021 so, I guess the info about Outlet Mall garage info on google map is not correct then since it said the garage open 24 /7. In that case, is it possible that I can leave car overnight? I will have to leave car for 3 days and will pick it up during daytime. Thanks. Check their website or call to see if you can reserve your 3 days. I couldn’t reserve anything past midnight when I did it in 2019 oct and when I went to retrieve my car at about 11 pm the place was almost empty. Thank, I\\'ll give them a call to be sure, but the website allows me to reserve 3 days for $75...ouch. I’m due to go New York for New Years with my partner and we wish to do something in time square.\\nWondered if anyone could recommend somewhere that includes drinks and a view of the ball drop?\\nI saw a vlog where someone went to tonic - but appears to have closed down since.\\nAlso can you advise when tickets are normally on sale for events and how much they cost (roughly)\\nAny help appreciated - Thankyou :) How much are you willing to spend to see the ball drop with drinks? It will be expensive. Since I am going to have to pre-book all of my daytime attractions, I am trying to figure out what days to do what. I would love any suggestions on if there is a specific day that you recommend for any of the places below or any that you think could be grouped together?\\nI am going to be in the city 7 full days (Tues through Thur) and 2 half days for the travel days. I just bought a ticket for a singer at Webster Hall for the day I arrive and not planning anything for the day I leave. I have a LOT of show tickets, the 2nd Wednesday is a matinee and a evening performance. Two nights are free, one of which I am planning on sitting in a bar and watching a football game, (Sunday).\\nI have a chart written out for the places I want to visit and the hours/days they are open.\\nI want to plan a day for Brooklyn so also trying to figure out what day to spend there.\\nMy museums of choice are:\\nThe Met\\nMOMA\\nWhitney\\nMorgan Library\\nNatural History\\nFrick at Madison\\n9-11 Museum\\nand I REALLY would like to take a day to visit the NYB Garden since I am a pretty big gardener.\\nI KNOW it sounds exhausting but in my mind, I am visiting one/two attraction, one show per day.\\nI\\'ll also be solo which honestly is more efficient in terms of time because you are never waiting on someone. I am willing to eliminate, just looking for some feedback.\\nThank you! Museums are almost always most crowded weekend afternoons. So maybe go to the less crowded museums (like the Frick and Morgan) on weekends, and save the most crowded (like MOMA) for weekdays.\\nNYBG in particular is amazing on weekdays - very empty compared to weekends.\\nThe Met stays open late on Friday nights, and while you would think it would get crowded with \"date night,\" it\\'s actually a really nice and lowkey time to go while most people are at dinner. I don\\'t know your tolerance for long days at museums, but you can easily spend all day at the Met (my gf and I decided to spend one winter seeing the whole Met in detail and it took us 6 trips at 3-4 hours per trip, but of course, we live here). Maybe come on a Friday - do the less crowded areas in the afternoon, then spend the evening enjoying the areas of the museum that are generally most crowded (Egyptian wing - nicely lit up at night, any temporary exhibits, maybe the impressionism area).\\nActually, if you really love museums, you might consider spending 2 days just at the Met. It\\'s worth it.\\nIn terms of time commitment, the Met and NYBG are the biggest, followed by Natural History. Don\\'t believe Met is currently open late Friday or any other night. Cut back to 5PM closings and believe that still holds. Check all museum websites for current opening times.\\nPersonally, I would avoid booking first day after museum was closed. For example, I believe Met is currently closed Tues and Weds. So I would avoid booking Thurs as a lot of people who tried to go Tues or Weds without reservations may show up Thurs and make it more crowded than it otherwise might be.\\nI used to prefer going to the Met mid to late afternoon on a day it was open late, but since there are no longer, for now, late nights,1 I might go earlier in afternoon. I usually spend only an hour or two at a time in Met, but if you want to spend a lot of time, or all day, you should probably go earlier. I would not only list the hours of operation but also what exhibits you are most interested in so that you don\\'t miss any particular exhibit you\\'re interested in. Also note how big the museums are. For example, you can probably check off the Morgan in an afternoon but the Met (as been has been mentioned previously) can take several days. So you need to ask yourself what do I really want to see? I remember going to a zoo in Honolulu which had a sign which read (I paraphrase \"If you want to see a little bit of everything, it takes an hour. If you want to see many things, it takes half a day. To see the whole zoo takes a full day.\" ) The same thing applies to museums, If you only want to zip through a museum it will take much less time than if you study the exhibits.\\nEdited: 6:29 pm, August 14, 2021 For the benefit of others who may be planning museum trips, note that currently, and with the notable exception of MoMA, most of the major museums in Manhattan are open 5 days a week and closed either Mon - Tues or Tues - Weds. However, Frick Madison is open only 4 days a week and closed Mon - Weds.\\nAlways check their websites for changes in opening times. I would pick the Met , Museum of Natutal History and the Botanical Gardens. The 9/11 museum is a toss up as it depends if you really want to see that or not.\\nIf you looks Museums and Gardens then go to the Brooklyn Museum and the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, they are next to each other In 7 days plus a visit to the NYBG and Brooklyn, you might be able to do this:\\nThe Met and go to The Frick afterwards (The Frick doesn\\'t need a heap of time and it\\'s nearby)\\nMOMA or Whitney (they are both modern art, Whitney is more American art while MoMA is everything)\\nMorgan Library (or eliminate this is you don\\'t feel you have time. It\\'s good but you only need 1-2 hours there).\\nAMNH\\n9-11 Museum and go to Brooklyn in the afternoon\\nNYBG Since you state you are also doing shows, if you are doing Broadway please note that the Morgan is near the 42nd St end of the Theater District & MoMA is near the 55th St end of the theater district. The Met is expanding its hours:\\nBeginning Tuesday, September 7, The Met is extending it’s hours:\\nSunday–Tuesday, and Thursday: 10 am–5 pm\\nFriday and Saturday: 10 am–9 pm\\nClosed Wednesday\\nThe Frick has moved to allow reconstruction of its landmark home.\\nEncounter masterpieces from the Renaissance to the early twentieth century at Frick Madison, the temporary new home of The Frick Collection at 945 Madison Avenue.\\nDAY HOURS\\nMonday CLOSED\\nTuesday CLOSED\\nWednesday CLOSED\\nThursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\\nFriday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\\nSaturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\\nSunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m I really appreciate the feedback! You\\'ve given me some ideas. I should mention that I have visited the Met and MOMA before but it has been 13 years since I\\'ve been to the city. The rest I have never been to.\\nI was thinking of going to The Met on Monday but the Frick is closed then. Perhaps I\\'ll just go to the Frick or Morgan Library on the day I leave.\\nHow is the Botanical Garden on a Sunday? Probably crowded? I\\'m sure anytime of the year is lovely to visit there I am assuming? (I will be there Sept end, Oct start)\\nThanks again, appreciate the help. I don\\'t know how it has been recently, but in \"normal\" times the NYBG can be quite crowded on Sundays. A lot of families on the grounds (not necessarily in special exhibits, I think there is or was a special grounds pass for very local people). Autumn is spectacular there. There is a native plant garden that is spectacular at its peak. Other special interest gardens outside that can be very interesting. If you have never been in the forest part of the garden, take a walk. It is supposedly the last bit of virgin forest in NYC. Note there is a section on their website called something like \"what to see now\" that is updated at least weekly, maybe daily, showing what is particularly worth seeing at any particular moment. Their gift shop/bookstore has a lot of good gardening books and some interesting gift items. Hi! My 19 year old niece and two friends are traveling to NYC in November. I told her to drive to Yonkers and take the train to NYC. But I can\\'t find anywhere how much it is to park in the parking garage at the Amtrak station.\\nI booked her at the Chelsea Savoy Hotel, 204 W. 23rd Street. So where should they get off the train? They can get off the train and catch the subway to the hotel, in the same building, right?\\nAny tips about the subway? They have to go to the Javits building from the hotel.\\nAny info is appreciated. I was there about 12 years ago and I can\\'t remember much.\\nThanks! The train will take them to Penn Station. From there they can walk to the hotel in under 10 minutes. Assuming the friends are the same age, have you confirmed that the hotel will accept a party of guests all under age 21?\\nFor subway transportation, the number 1 train stops right outside the hotel. To go to Javits, they would take the 1 train uptown to Times Square, then transfer to the 7 train to Hudson Yards. To be honest, Google Maps generally has very good travel info, so a lot of this will probably be easily answered by just googling \"Yonkers to 204 W 23rd St\" and googling \"204 W. 23rd St\" to wherever else they want to go, like the Javits Building (is it definitely \"Javits Building\" that they\\'re going to and not the Javits Center? One (Building) is a federal building, the other (Center) is a convention center).\\nDepending on how much they\\'re up for walking, they may be able to get off the train if they come into Penn Station and walk to their hotel.\\nNo tips on parking in Yonkers, unfortunately.\\nIs there anything in particular that you\\'re wondering about the subway? Why did you pick Yonkers?\\nAmtrak and the Metro North commuter trains run the same route along the Hudson River\\nIf you click on the town/station names on this map http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/mnrmap.htm it will give you parking info for each town\\nThere are some other stations farther north that have more parking in nicer towns. Look at Poughkeepsie, Croton-Harmon and Tarrytown\\nWill they be taking an MN train (which is cheaper, more frequent and goes into Grand Central) OR an Amtrak train (which needs reservations and goes into Penn Station)? My Subway tip is to tell the girls to download Citymapper on their phone for transit directions and walking. They may prefer Google, one or the other will show them how to get around, Even if they don’t know the city because you don’t need addresses or intersections, you use landmarks or hotel names etc. Hi! No I didn’t think to check on age requirements! I will tomorrow.\\nThanks for the info. I will tell her. Thanks for the tip! I will tell them. Tudor the map! That was helpful! I just picked Yonkers bc that’s what I did years ago.\\nI think they will be taking the other one not Amtrak.\\nThanks for the help, I appreciate it! I suggest getting the young adults involved in the planning of their trip. If they\\'re going to the Javits Center, they should walk from their hotel. It\\'s under a half hour walk and they will see a bit of Manhattan. The producers announced Monday this revival would not return to Broadway. It had only opened in Feb 2020 and as I recall was still in previews when the lockdown began. I have a friend in the cast we were hoping to see, they only found out this week, too. Very disappointing It was an interesting take but am looking forward to seeing Steven Spielberg\\'s film in December. So disappointed. Had tickets for May 2020 and took the voucher instead of the refund hoping to rebook. Pooh! I used to live in NYC, and we are coming back with friends that have never been. We have 24 hours we will do all the tourist stuff during the day, but want a cool night time activity. thinking the west village, but open to a cool dining experience. We looking for a fun different experience! we are staying at the hilton in the fashion district. Shukette just opened, that should be fun.\\nYou might find Niche Niche fun.\\nDo you have food or budget parameters? That would help. When is this visit? visit is on a friday in mid september, budget $200 per couple at dinner or show. Does the amount include alcohol (which is typically expensive)? I dont know what it costs or if it will be open in September , but the Upright Citizens Bridge is usually pretty cheap and excellent **Upright Citizens Bridge**\\n....has closed down. You don\\'t list where you\\'re from nor do you make mention of Covid issues. I don,t know which shows will be running but the immersive “Sleep No More” is certainly different although I wouldn\\'t personally be interested because of Covid. The same venue , the McKittrick hotel has other experiences.\\nhttps://ci.ovationtix.com/30945/production/1025360\\nDrag Bingo at Le Poisson Rouge is another idea.\\nhttps://lpr.com/lpr_artists/le-bingo-fridays/\\nYou could go to Comey Islamd . They have fireworks on Friday nights although not sure how far into Sept. that goes. There are some Russian nightclubs in Neighton Beach nearby that could be fun. Tatiana is the most well known.\\nEdited: 4:13 pm, August 12, 2021 we live in maryland. We aren\\'t too worried about covid.... we just want to have a good time. we are all vaccinated. Some Broadway shows start in September.\\nhttps://www.playbill.com/article/schedule-of-upcoming-and-announced-broadway-shows-com-113677 The Barrow Street Theater is a small theater and production company located in the West Village that had some wonderful shows in the past. It looks like they\\'re not up and running anymore which is a shame.\\nhttp://www.barrowstreettheatre.com/\\nA good alternative in the East Village is the Bedlam theater company and they are running their Persuasion production from mid-September. It\\'s a send up of the famous Jane Austen book. I saw their Sense and Sensibility show a few years ago and it was so good, very clever, very funny and I loved it (it was in a different small theater though). Persuasion will have a small audience in a small theater. Highly recommended.\\nhttps://bedlam.org/\\nYou could combine the show with a great dinner nearby and drinks afterwards. The East Village is good. Our airbnb reservation was just canceled due to bedbug infestation. We are 6 adults with 3 children. ages 3, 6 and 8.\\nAny suggestions will be greatly appreciated.\\nThank you,\\nJoefromLynn Be aware that the majority of AirBnB Style short term apartment rentals are illegal in all of NYC (So your host may have been busted not infested)\\nThey are illegal in any residential building with three or more units. The only potentially legal ones are in one or two family houses - which are uncommon in areas that are desirable or convenient for visitors https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/articles/liz-krueger/answers-new-yorkers-concerned-or-confused-about-illegal-hotel-law and https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/about-illegal-short-term-rentals.page\\nThe source of the offer does not matter - the legal classification of the building does. No internet middleman, even otherwise respectable or well known ones (AirBnB, Vrbo, TA, etc), vets listings for compliance with local laws, leaving visitors vulnerable.\\nTo get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station (OR if driving and need parking - directions of travel) and 4) hotel budget. There are some legal apartment style hotels if a kitchen is important. The Leon hotel in Chinatown has rooms that will accommodate six persons. I haven’t checked for availability. They need accommodations for 9.\\nYou will need to get 3 hotel rooms. The TRYP hotel has family rooms with bunk beds that may work for one family. It is centrally located and it has a variety of room types so if there is availability and in your price range it would be a good option. # 3 Yes I realize they are 9 . But they do not *have to * get three hotel rooms.\\nDepends on who’s kids are who etc. I’ll leave that to the OP to figure out but at the Leon they could get two hotel rooms and they do have availability. Agree with Kaye. There is likely no bedbug infestation but either they got a better offer or their neighbors reported them for renting illegally. Find a few hotel rooms. I thought of another one; Sohotel on broome street has family rooms that accommodate 6 persons.\\nand 2 queen rooms. It also has availability on your dates. Obviously, there is no reason whatsoever 6 adults need to stay in the same place, I don\\'t even know why they would want to, that sounds really strange to me for any city vacation. Unless the term adult is being used for teenage children, of course. Sounds like 3 couples, so yes, they should just book 3 hotel rooms, what\\'s the problem. The only issue is finding one for those with children. Question is completely unclear as to what is really needed. It\\'s only 3 nights, also, no need for an apt.\\nFifty Hotel and Suites has rooms with two queens, so that should work for a family of 1 kid. They have some suites with kitchenetees, also.\\nThe Residence Inn Midtown has rooms with two beds plus sofabed and kitchenettes, also. Or 1 BRs. There are several Residence Inns in Manhattan.\\nOne of my favorite hotels when I go mainly for theater is the Holiday Inn Express Times Square. Which is not really at TS (luckily), it\\'s on 8th ave right near the 50th st subway station. It has very large rooms, and the rooms have a frig and microwave. They have a 2 queen deluxe room which is very cheap during those dates, only $116. So that\\'s what I would book, the location is great. Re #7 Check the address of Holiday Inn Express Times Square. I don\\'t believe location you gave is correct. >>Obviously, there is no reason whatsoever 6 adults need to stay in the same place, I don\\'t even know why they would want to, that sounds really strange to me for any city vacation<<<\\nWhoever suggested six adults stay in one hotel room? What then ? The 3 , 6 and 8 -year-old in their own room?\\nThere isn’t a problem , they either pick a hotel room with six in one room & three in the other\\nOR they pick a hotel with five in one and four in the other. OR 3 hotel rooms with 3 each .\\nBUT it depends on who the children belong to. .\\nThis is the OP’s vacation, but I see nothing strange about two couples ,\\n(4adults ) in one room along with two children.( A room for six.) https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/articles/2021/8/old-new-york\\nMost people know that The Met has an incredible array of art and artefacts of historical significance from around the world but they have also retained and preserved and displayed remnants of architectural features and interiors from New York properties that no longer exist, either demolished or renovated in the name of progress.\\nThe facade of the Second Branch Bank of the United States in The Charles Engelhard Court is amazing.\\nAs is the All Angels’ Church Pulpit and Choir Rail, circa 1900.\\nNo wonder The Met is such a big attraction in NYC, it has a mind boggling array of displays. It also has the whole room where Washinton had his last birthday party. The Adam style dining room in the British section was owned for a time by Mr. Selfridge of London department store fame. An earlier diner in this same room was Benjamin Franklin. There is also the world\\'s oldest piano and mostly complete chess set. Look carefully in the French section and you will see furniture with the initials of MA on it for Marie Antoinette. There is a good deal of history at the Met in addition to art. Interesting stuff, Fox. There is definitely more than art. A list of 190 Manhattan 18+ hotels follows--along with 7 lawful 18+ Manhattan hostels (including full or partial hostel-style hotel lodging), 8 18+ hotels in Long Island City, and 2 18+ hostels in Long Island City. (The list of Manhattan hotels does not include other temporary lodging.)\\nLodging with an age 18+ policy will interest those 18+ guests registering (and their parents or guardians who do not accompany them)—as well as age 21+ hotels which are re-considering their policy, or are unable to register an 18+ visitor but which may wish to assist them in finding suitable lodging. (In the past, relatively few Manhattan hotels welcomed 18+ registering guests. Now, not quite half (190) of 403 the TA-rated Manhattan hotels surveyed do so.)\\nMinimum age rules and other policies (including bedding and who and how many others can stay with an 18+ registered guest) can vary, change and should be confirmed with pertinent rates and features before booking.

I try to visit twice a year but Covid prevented me from visiting since Dec 2019 so I was extremely excited for this trip. I arrived via LGA at 9am on Thursday. I am very impressed with the new LGA terminal B. Just gorgeous. I had no trouble getting a cab to my hotel, the Affinia Shelburn on Lexington near 38th. I knew I was too early for checkin but thought I would give it a whirl. As I feared, they did not have my reservation. I booked a king studio suite ($99/night) on their website back in March and noticed right away they did not send a confirmation email. I called the hotel three times between March arrival day to confirm my res and ask for an email confirmation. Each time I was given the same confirmation number and told I would get an email but I never did. Even checked my junk folder each time and never received it. So when I arrived at the hotel I was not surprised they could not find my res. The staff told me to come back at 3:00 and they would have a room for me.\\nI headed to the train and found my way to Harlem Public for lunch. I had a wonderful chicken sandwich snd sweet potato fries. The place was small but the service was quick and friendly. I then headed to Trinity Cemetery off Riverside Drive. I spent two hours here admiring the beautiful resting places of so many departed. What a gorgeous cemetery and the views of the Hudson were a bonus. I have a thing for cemeteries. I have visited Green Wood a few times (though I have not seen it all) but I wanted to check this one out, knowing it was much more manageable in a few hours.\\nI headed back to the hotel at 3:00 and was given no explanation or apology for my res problem. At least they found me a room.\\nI checked in and was very happy with my room. It was a great size for just me, had a very comfortable bed, a hot shower and a fridge. I would definitely stay at the Shelburn again, only hoping there are no issues with my res next time.\\nI rested a bit and cleaned up for dinner and a show. After a fabulous dinner of ricotta ravioli with lobster at Coppola’s East (one of my faves) I headed to see Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett in their final show at Radio City. I really lucked into this ticket. It was not cheap but it was worth every dollar. I had seen Gaga twice but never Mr Bennett. As we entered Radio City our phones were put in locked pouches so we could not access them during the show. Gaga explained the show was being recorded for tv broadcast at a later date. What an amazing show! Gaga is such a talent, she can sing anything. Seeing Mr Bennett was such a gift, he is 95! I made a new friend during the show too…… a woman from Connecticut who digs Gaga as much as I do. 😊\\nI walked back to the hotel after the show and collapsed in bed.\\nOn Friday I slept much later than I had planned but clearly needed the rest. I made my way to Wagamama for lunch at 3rd and 39th. I was familiar with this chain thanks to finding them on a trip to London. I had the ginger chicken udon. Yummmmmm!!! I want some now. After lunch I headed to the Frick Madison. On my last visit in 2019 I visited the Frick but they are now closed for renovations so many of the works of art are on display here temporarily. I had read in the Times that\\nIt was worth a visit, seeing familiar works in a different setting with more natural light and not as much distraction from the fancy furniture one would find in the Frick. I truly enjoyed seeing (among others) Vermeer, Monet and Renoir up close, something one can’t do at the Frick. I recommend visiting these works while they are in their temporary home. After strolling the UES for a while I made my way to the Empire State Building for a sunset visit. I had a ticket for the 86th and 102nd floors. I had not been to the ESB since pre 9/11 and I knew the observatories were recently renovated. I can remember stuffy, crowded hallways full of crowds pre 9/11. Not any more. The line to get to the 86th floor moved quickly and efficiently. The views and the sunset were incredible. I spent two hours up there. I could have stayed up there forever. It is so peaceful hearing the traffic from so far up. After plenty of sunset photos I headed back down to ground level. I headed to Toloache in Midtown for dinner. I had never been but had read good things. I was not disappointed. The chicken enchiladas were to die for. I will certainly go back. After dinner, off to bed for the night.\\nSaturday morning brought more sleeping in (I have two kids at home so I sleep when I can). After a leisurely wake up I went to down the street to Murray Hill Diner for French toast. I remembered this spot from my last visit, my daughter loves New York diners and we ended up there on our last trip together. Nothing fancy there, good food though. After brunch I went to the farmers market at Union Square. I knew there would be vendors selling their wares snd I wanted to find a cool piece of jewelry for my daughter. I succeeded, finding a necklace for her. I had a ticket for a catacomb by candlelight tour at the original St Patrick’s church that afternoon. I am so glad i took the tour. Our guide was so informative about the history of the church and diocese. The church was small but lovely and the catacombs were so interesting. I’m keeping with my cemetery fascination, i found this tour worth the time and money. After the tour, I then walked to Dylan’s Candy Bar on Lexington/60th to get some junk for my son. He expects candy every time I visit, as if he can’t find the same candy at home. I was disappointed to see (thanks to Covid) one can not scoop out one’s own candy and bag it anymore. Everything is pre-bagged. It kind of takes all the fun out of the visit. Oh well.\\nAfter resting at the hotel for a while I went to The Smith in the East Village for dinner. I have been to The Smith’s other locations a few times and have always enjoyed the atmosphere and food. I had black ink tagliatelle with shrimp and calamari. It was fantastic. Bed time after dinner.\\nOn Sunday morning I only had time for brunch before meeting my car service at the hotel for the trip back to LGA. I dined at Penelope on Lexington, a few blocks from the hotel. I had a lobster roll and it was perfect. What a cute little place Penelope is. I will keep it on my list of brunch spots.\\nI used Carmel for the trip to LGA. I had never used a car service for my return trip, always a cab before. I will use Carmel again. It was basically the same price as a cab and I didn’t have to flag anyone down with my luggage. Very efficient and friendly service.\\nI hope I didn’t bore anyone with my report. I’m not a drinker or a night owl and I enjoy being alone so eating, walking and exploring museums/taking tours are my thing. I walked more on this trip than I think I ever had. Taking a train only when I didn’t think I could walk any further, I made an effort to enjoy every sight and sound I encountered in my short visit. I can not wait to get back! fun trip. thanks for your trip report. I really enjoyed reading your TR. Not at all boring.\\nThanks for telling us about the Frick Madison. I love that building and really want to see the Frick Collection there, but doubt that will happen. Luckily there\\'s been a lot online about it.\\nGo back soon and write another TR please.\\nEdited: 5:01 am, August 13, 2021 Very enjoyable report. Thanks for sharing. Love this! As my girls get older, this will become more and more my plan! I have the same travel style, thanks for sharing your report! I have never been to The Frick but plan on visiting the temporary location. I have to start planning my days and buying my museum tickets. Did you have reservations for your meals or were able to just walk in? Wonderful report.\\nI love reading trip reports as they refresh my perspective on the many sights and sounds I\\'m inured to. Thanks for making it come alive again! Loved reading your report\\nMade me even more excited for my own, I believe, 10th trip to New York next Thursday, most of which solo. And my next trip will also be solo and also be only for a few days. My last one being October 2019.\\nI might try to fit the catacombs into my visit.\\nThank you for reporting Thank you all for the kind remarks. I love traveling solo and there is no better place to do it than NYC.\\nStephintampa….I did have a res for Coppola’s, The Smith and Toloache.

There is a designated pick up spot for Uber and car services. Prices vary as set forth in #1 above.\\nFrom the Taxi and Limo Commission website:\\nThe maximum amount of passengers allowed in a yellow taxicab by law is four (4) in a four (4) passenger taxicab or five (5) passengers in a five (5) passenger taxicab, except that an additional passenger must be accepted if such passenger is under the age of seven (7) and is held on the lap of an adult passenger seated in the rear. Hi!\\nI am an international student traveling to NYC this month.\\nAs I am moving to the city and I will need a new sim and mobile plan for me, I was thinking of going for the mint mobile 30$ a month unlimited plan but I have recently found out that it can be set up online only.\\nI, however will need a US No. to call a cab at the airport and I wanted to know if I can buy a sim at the airport instantly.\\nI’d really appreciate if someone could guide me based on what mobile carriers and plans are available at the airport (JFK Terminal 4) to purchase and which plan would be best for me keeping mind I am looking for plans within 40$ dollars a month.\\nThanks in advance **will need a US No. to call a cab at the airport**\\nYou really don\\'t.\\nThere are NYC taxis right outside the terminal that you can utilize. What ter1413 said.\\nYou don\\'t need a cell phone.\\nIf you really want a temporary SIM until you get the mint plan set up (which is a great plan), then get a T-Mobile Pre-Paid sim - probably not much time to get one shipped to you now though - can\\'t your current home plan Roam for the few days?\\nNot sure where you\\'re travelling from so hard to advise on that.\\nM Where are you headed after your arrival at JFK?\\nIt is probably not necessary to use a personal phone to arrange transport\\nThere are cabs and there may be public transport options https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/public-transportation\\nYou are unlikely to get the best value for money from the sims available at the airport and should probably wait until you are at your destination to make a more considered choice of providers/plans The airport is the worst place to buy phones or SIM cards. Prices are high and there are all sorts of scams. It\\'s ridiculous to commit to a phone or plan for an extended stay just because you think you need one immediately. You don\\'t. Official yellow nyc taxis are waiting outside the terminal. Go to the official taxi line where there\\'s a dispatcher. Wait in line and get a rexwipt from the dispatcher which will have the taxi number. Keep it. Should you leave something behind, you\\'ll have the taxi number. If you prefer a car service, the 2 major companies, Carmel and Dial 7 have courtesy phones near the transportation desk. Do not accept a ride from anyone who approaches you regardless of how good the offer sounds. Again, lots of scams.

JFK also has free wifi if you want data while you\\'re in the airport. And you don\\'t need to call a taxi as others have said.\\nSo you don\\'t really need phone access while you\\'re in the airport, and if you\\'re staying in a hotel initially (don\\'t know your arrival set up) most hotels have free wifi. Use that as soon as you get to the hotel if you want data.\\nThen go to a phone store near the hotel or wherever you\\'re staying. T-Mobile is good and has many branches in the city. Thankyou so much for help! Really appreciate it. Hi, We are visiting NYC with 8 yr old boys for the first time. Should we do Ferry to SOL or take a cruise and view from far? How long will the ferry to n fro take? (if we take the first ferry). We will be staying in Times sq so not sure how much time it will take to get to the port? We are more inclined towards the ferry to SOL but I want to hear other suggestions as well. Thankyou I took a sunset cruise one year which was, in my opinion, the best. You leave port when the sun is still up and come back with the city all lit up. You actually get quite close to the statue (much closer than the Staten Island Ferry) and you also get commentary on the city. I think you have to figure 4 hrs. to go to the Statue and Ellis Island.. (The ticket also allows you to visit ellis Island and the museum there.). If you don\\'t go to a Ellis island maybe 3 hrs.. it will take about 20-30 mins. By subway to get downtown from your hotel. There\\'s also a museum in the pedestal of the statue. To just pass the Statue closely there are a number of different cruises that leave from different locations that can take anywhere from an hour to maybe 3 hrs. The Staten Island ferry is free and passes the Statue froma. Distance and takes about an hour to ride roundtrip.\\nThe views of the Statue are better, imo from somewhat of a distance but if they want to go to the museum, you have to go. The crown is currently closed ESB ukase of Covid.\\nEdited: 12:20 pm, August 06, 2021 The museum has moved from the pedestal to the new musueum building on Liberty Island. You used to be required to have pedestal or crown tickets to access it. Now it\\'s open for everyone, even those with grounds only tickets. I like the new musuem a lot. I highly recommend getting SOL tickets so you can walk around the island, do the pedestal, museum and Ellis Island. All are great experiences. If you can’t get SOL tickets, there is a speed boat that speeds down the Hudson and does doughnuts around the SOL. I would expect your 8 year olds would love it. https://www.thebeastnyc.com/ Do your kids care? Neither of mine wanted to go to the SOL and were happy just seeing it from Battery Park. I wish mine were not either LOL. They have read a ton about NY and are super pumped about seeing literally everything. So I am trying to see if its worth the time since it will take atleast half the day. Me and my husband went like 10 yrs back and don\\'t remember much but the ferry was nice break from the city but I dont remember anything major in the island. I would recommend going to the islands rather than just sailing by, if your kids are keen on that.\\nIt\\'s at least a 4 hour commitment for both islands including getting over there and back, but once you\\'re there you can do audio tours, watch short films about the statue and immigration experience (these are great and you can sit and rest for a while in comfy seats), and they even have Ranger tours that will lead you around and explain lots of things you wouldn\\'t have known.\\nThere are cafeterias on both islands so you don\\'t have to rush back to Manhattan to find food.\\nThe views of Manhattan are also a highlight.\\nGoing to the SOL and Ellis Island is one of the biggest activities to do in NYC if you don\\'t mind the expense. The ferry will not give you a particularly good look at the statue. It\\'s best to take a cruise to take a liberty cruise that drops you off at the statue. Although you do not need to get off of the boat it will still give you a really good look at her. If you get off the boat and onto the island the boat returns every 30 minutes to do another pick up. So you would literally have enough time to get off the boat walk once around the statue and turn around for the next boat. Just remember that the island is a pleasant place just to be for a a bit. So you might consider that. From the statue it will stop at Ellis Island and again you do not need to get off of the boat. So if you really want to see her, in the least take the liberty cruise to the island, whether or not you get off the boat depends on you. I don\\'t agree that the best views are from the ferry to the statue. The other cruises get quite close to the statue for photo ops and show more of the harbor including going under the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges. The ferry to the statue may be cheapest though.\\nI don\\'t know if the museum was there 10 years ago. If the kids really want to go, do it. But if the just want to see it up close, I honk the Circle Line half circle or\\nSail-nyc.com\\nare just as good if not better for more views. The SOL Museum was moved from the Pedestal to the new freestanding location in 2019 https://www.nps.gov/stli/planyourvisit/visiting-the-museum.htm We will be in NYC for 5 days and staying in TS and going to the usual touristy places. We are 2 adults + 2 kids. For a day , we will be around TS, CP, TOTR, Lego store so it should be mostly walkable. Do we need to buy the 7 day metro card? If we don\\'t, how do you get on the Roosevelt Tram? Can you just buy a ticket there? Do you \"need\" to? No. You can buy a pay-per-ride card and add $.\\nWould I recommend it? Yes. An unlimited for everyone(depending on the kids height as 44\" and under don\\'t require a fare.) If you make 12 or more trips, the unlimited card is better value. If the kids are 44” or less, they ride free.\\nhttps://queenseagle.com/all/2019/3/4/heres-how-to-choose-the-best-metrocard-for-your-commute Weekly Metrocards are fairly likely to be your best value https://new.mta.info/fares Breakeven ~13 rides Even if you don\\'t quite get to breakeven having a weekly unlimited lets you freely take short bus or subway rides and not spend time refilling cards\\nThe RI tram is paid via Metrocard. (There are Metrocard vending machines at the tram stations and virtually all subway entrances Machines can be used to purchase and, if needed, refill cards)\\nI\\'d simply stop by a subway sometime during your walk.\\nIf you see an attended subway booth be sure to pick up (free) paper subway maps as souvenirs\\nWhen I have house guests I give them a subway map and some highlighters to mark each days route during the our evening in debrief (different colors for each day) as a souvenir / memory aid. Your kids might enjoy that my kids are 8 and over 44\" so we will all have to buy the card. working on the map is a great suggestion, they love doing it. This is our temp itinerary. Does it need weekly pass?\\nSunday- Hotel @TS -- St Patricks , TOTR @sunset, Times square, \\nMonday -  central park , Roosevelt Tram, Lego store , Bloomingdales\\nTuesday -  Brooklyn bridge walk, Timeout market for eating ; dumbo \\nWednesday -   edge , the vessel, Chelsea market for eating; pass by High line\\nThursday - Statue of Liberty , battery park, carousel,  911 memorial walk, WTC, Wall street,  5 days? I would get an unlimited.\\nRemember, you may want to head back to your hotel for a break or to wash up prior to dinner. So that may be another subway/bus ride.\\nEx...when I am out and about during the weekend, I easily use the subway 6+ times in 1 day. I count 8 planned subway/bus rides in your itinerary without even considering changing your plans, tired feet or bad weather. Get the passes. At what hotel are you staying? Some hotels have \"Times Square\" in the name and are nowhere near TS. If you are staying actually in/near TS, then on Sunday, you can walk to those places, no Metrocard needed. (However, if it\\'s raining/snowing/cold you might want to take a subway/bus. When are you coming?)\\nThe LEGO store is in Rockefeller Center, so that would be better on Sunday. (Check if they\\'re open.)\\nYou could take a nice walk from TS to CP, but depending upon where you wish to go in CP, you might want to take public transport. CP is huge.\\nIf you\\'ve been doing a lot of walking in the Park, it might feel like a slog to get to the Roosevelt Island Tram. On 59th St. between Madison & Park there\\'s a bus stop. There you could get onto the Q32 bus (masks required) and take it a few short blocks to 59th & 2nd Ave. (last stop before bus goes to Queens). The Roosevelt Island Tram is just one block North from there. With an unlimited Metrocard it will be a breeze.\\nThe rest of your days you will definitely need to take public transport.\\nThursday. Try to get the earliest possible tickets for the Statue of Liberty--by 9:30-10 if you can. Otherwise the lines can be horrendous. If you go to the SOL and Ellis Island, this excursion will take the better part of 3 to 4 hours. There is no World Trade Center anymore. There\\'s One World Observatory. NYC Expert Risa can suggest some stellar eating places down there.\\nHave a marvelous time! I think they may be planning to go to the Lego store in the Flatiron https://www.lego.com/en-my/stores/store/flatiron-district so getting there and back will add rides\\nThe Vessel is closed for climbing due to recent unfortunate events\\nI\\'d go for the convenience of the unlimiteds\\nEdited: 12:03 pm, August 12, 2021 Get them, even if you don\\'t break even. I would break even in those days, and perhaps you do too, but even so ...\\nIt means:\\nYou save time by not having to refill the cards at all.\\nYou don\\'t have to even consider if you\\'re going to take an \\'unplanned\\' bus or subway trip. Let\\'s say some of you are tired and want to save your feet for a bit - take that extra ride a few blocks or stations.\\nMajor change in weather making you have to change some of your plans? Get to and from your next destination smoothly. If you cannot get enough value out of the unlimited card, you can just use your credit card to tap everyone in now and pay per ride. So you won\\'t actually need to buy cards. You can not utilize the unlimited system with this method though.\\nDiane\\nNYC Photo Safari Hi, Can you please help me with my itinerary. Arriving on Sunday afternoon 1st week of Sep with 8 yr old kids. We stay in Time square.\\nSunday- Times square\\nMonday - one world observatory, 911 memorial, WTC, Wall street, & Brooklyn bridge, \\nTuesday -  central park, St Patricks cathedral, rockerfeller center , top of the rock , Cruise \\nWed -  Statue of Liberty & Brooklyn bridge , Edge & empire state building , hop on off\\nThursday - Relatively free; please suggest any other places or if things look too tight from Mon - wed that would be open/we can visit on Thursday. I am trying to minimize walking (I know we should still be walking) and less back and forth. Also, do you recommend to buy NY Pass? If yes, which one? We don\\'t recommend attraction passes as you rarely get the bargains they advertise. If you must get an attraction pass, get one where you can pick & choose your attractions & make certain that what you are buying is what you want. For example, if you want to visit the American Museum of Natural History, make certain that you understand that the pass voucher only covers basic admission & not special exhibits of which there are many. If you\\'re going to do a hop on off bus tour, it\\'s best to do it at the beginning of the visit, not the end. Just ride a loop which takes about 2 hours. If you hop off you\\'ll wait a long time for the next bus. Sunday is a good day to do this since traffic is lighter. That said, I don\\'t know that 8 year olds would find it fun. Depending on what time you arrive on Sunday, you can do far more than seeing Times Square. You could do Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick\\'s on Sunday...or the bus or go to Central Park. It will have more activity and buskers on Aunday than a weekday.\\nThe Statue of Liberty ferries and the Brooklyn Bridge are down in the same area as your Mon. Plans. Unless you have a special reason to go to the Statue,, I would just pass it on a cruise. There are cruises that leave from midtown and others that leave from further downtown.\\nSail-nyc.com\\nis popular on the forum and has both antique yachts and sailboats. Or the standar Circle Line cruise is also fine.\\nSpend some time looking at eating options. The Times Square rea (and all the touristy areas) tend to have a lot of overpriced and not so great food. Do know that you are spending a relatively short time in NYC and going to up to 4 observatories(2 in one day) and walking the Brooklyn Bridge.\\nI would visit 2 observation decks. Four to me is really overkill...just my opinion.\\nYou also miss much of the feel of NYC by not checking out the various neighborhoods.\\nThe first Sunday in Sept is Labor Day weekend. Any interests in the Intrepid? Lego store? Baseball game? Brazil Festival(hopefully, that Sunday)? Coney Island? Chinatown?\\nI could go on and on....\\nEdited: 10:57 am, August 04, 2021 Thats a great suggestion. We should do hop on on Sunday to see the city. My kids would wanna go to see statue of liberty :) This is their first NY visit. I was checking the prices and everything is around $40/person so thought buying 3day NY pass would be cheaper. Is that not correct? Yes lego store and china town are in my list :) When I read it says every observation deck might take 1-2hours so I was wondering if they are in same direction, we could do 2. Start using google maps.\\nMaps.google.com\\nJust type a place like the name of your hotel (add nyc at the end) and then get directions to wherever. I agree 4 observatories is too much.\\nGoing to the Staue takes a long time with airport type security. If you want to go, book in advance at a specific time. I don\\'t think you can do that with a pass.\\nStatuecruises.com\\nThe first ferry of the day is always least crowded.\\nEverything is not $40 for the kids. You have to do the math. I agree look for a build your own pass where you pick what you want to do. Otherwise you’re paying for things you won,t have time to do. SOL tickets are less than 24 dollars per person. And they are best bought from the original vendor, Statue Cruises. You want timed tickets which you won\\'t get with the pass - you get a voucher to trade for a ticket and it means there\\'s a big risk for long lines / a long wait. Are you going to the 9/11 museum too? If not, I think i\\'d add SOl to this downtown day.\\nYou have Brooklyn Bridge listed twice?\\nI\\'d also not do four observatories in such a short visit. And this comes from me who LIKES observatories. Been doing ESB, TOTR and OWO on one and the same trip once (I had a friend with me who was a first timer and it was within the first couple of months after OWO had opened to the public). But our stay was longer than yours.\\nI think you\\'re missing out on hanging out in some nice areas. My first pick would be Greenwich Village and a visit that includes Washington Square Park, if the weather is nice.\\nEdited: 11:24 am, August 04, 2021 Also, for a short visit I don\\'t think I would do both a cruise and SOL. Again, I\\'ve done both and highly enjoyed both but I think I\\'d do either a cruise or SOL at the same day as your downtown day. That would free up some time to perhaps visit a museum instead. With kids that age either Met Museum (Egyptian wing is awesome for all ages) or American Museum of Natural History (dinosaurs! And the panoramas from A Night at the Musuem if the kids has seen it and liked it): 8 yr olds? Boys? Girls? Both?\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos-fantastical-lemon-wonderland-grows-under-some-scaffolding-ninth-avenue\\n^\\nA nice photo op. I also have to ask....what do the kids like to do? What are their interests? That has not been mentioned...or I may have missed it. Recommendations for a family-friendly hotel near New York Botanical Gardens. We will have a car, so it doesn\\'t need to be that close. Looking for something clean and safe. It doesn\\'t have to be particularly fancy or trendy. With a car, I would look in Westchester County. I don\\'t think there is much worth looking at in the Bronx. Yonkers, New Rochelle, places like that.\\nEdited: 10:10 pm, August 10, 2021 Not too far away, in Yonkers, there is a Hyatt Place near the NY State Thruway, which would get you down to the garden pretty quickly. Just a bit further north in Yonkers, near Untermyer Park, there are both a Courtyard and a Hampton Inn. If it wasn\\'t for the car, I\\'d say just stay by Grand Central in midtown Manhattan. It\\'s less than a half hour by train, and the train station is right next to the Botanical Gardens.\\nThe hotels mentioned in the last sentence of post #2 (the Hampton Inn, the Courtyard, and there is also a Residence Inn) are on Executive Boulevard right near Untermyer Park in Yonkers. If you\\'re a big fan of botanical gardens like I am, Untermyer is a very worthy destination itself - really nice Persian garden overlooking a pretty part of the Hudson River. I\\'ve actually stayed at both the Courtyard and Residence Inn for work - both were nice; the Residence Inn nicer. Definitely an area you want to have a car in, but try to avoid driving anywhere near rush hour. You can certainly spend a full day at the NYBG, but sleeping there is unusual. Local traffic can be heavy, and on weekends, both the garden’s paid lots and paid garage can fill up. Last time I was there, a double parked car blocked the one-lane exit road for a few minutes. This is not like taking an Interstate to the Mall of America. Low rise urban motels can be noisy, for example garbage trucks. While the hotels in Yonkers may be closest, afaik, there,s not much else around there. A lot of the hotels in Westchester have pools (both indoor and outdoor) which the kids would like. The Radisson New Rochelle has an outdoor pool, if your trip is soon. It’s about 20-30 mins from the gardens by car. You could also take a Metro North train from New Rochelle and be in Manhattan in an hour. The downside is the hotel can be very busy if there are wedding parties on the weekend you visit. There are also a lot of hotels in White Plains with pools, just a bit further.\\nEdited: 8:46 am, August 11, 2021 Is this part of the same trip where you are visiting Manhattan and apparently staying at a hotel in midtown (54th / 6th)?\\nWhile it might make some sense to change hotels IF you plan to visit the NYBG at the beginning / end of your trip IMO it partly depends on your overall plan and when you will be driving -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

IF you are going to spend some of your trip nights in Manhattan then just stay at the Manhattan hotel and take the train to the gardens it is pretty easy. If you are not going to be staying in Manhattan then Westchester, white plains etc is where I would look to stay for better choice of properties. The drive from westchester to the NYBG is not difficult. But if these folks live in Boston and are driving back and forth from there, I see no reason they couldn\\'t stop for a night on their way to or from NYC and do the NYBG from a closer hotel. Don\\'t see any reason to stay in the Bronx if they are going to or coming from Manhattan. It isn\\'t like the NYBG is hours away from Manhattan. They would probably waste more time switching hotels than they would save. New to the area. Is there a way to drive from central Long Island to northern New Jersey WITHOUT driving through NYC? All the routes I see go through some part of downtown. From exactly where in Long Island to exactly where in New Jersey? Without that giving you a route is impossible in my opinion. You can take go north of the city and take either the Whitestone or Throgs Neck bridges. But there’s always traffic everywhere. Possibly less that route.\\nIf you don’t already have one installed, you should get a gps app like Waze. From Port Jeff/Stony Brook area to honestly anywhere in NJ haha. I have upcoming things in Hackettstown, Bridgewater, and Freehold.\\nI will look into Waze, thank you! I would really like to kind of plan ahead and most directions are very heavily based on current traffic conditions, which isn\\'t very helpful. In general avoid the routes that make you cross the Hudson River via the Holland or Lincoln tunnels which require driving through midtown or downtown\\nThe route mentioned above will take you briefly across upper Manhattan to cross the George Washington bridge\\nThere may be occasions when crossing Staten Island might make sense\\nIf you haven\\'t already consider getting an NY State issued EZ-Pass for the toll discount.\\nBe aware all toll crossings within the NYC city limits are cashless\\nEdited: 5:42 pm, August 12, 2021 What I would do:\\nGo to the Google directions page. Put in your starting point, and add two stops, Whitestone Bridge and then your final destination.\\nDo the same thing w Throgs Neck bridge.\\nIt will give you the routes you are asking about.\\nAnd to Kaye’s point, do the same thing but your second dedication is the Verrazano Bridge. That should give you comparisons The Throggs Neck Bride route only touches NYC for a short period of time and kind of on the edge -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

It shouldn\\'t be that much slower than driving when you take traffic into account, and you can get to NJ with one easy transfer at Penn Station. Both Hackettstown and Bridgewater have train stations, and the great part is that you can use the time on the train to catch up on work, so the overall time wasted ends up being far less.\\nEdited: 10:03 pm, August 12, 2021 Also what time of day? I know this is a bit pedantic, but it is not possible to drive to/from LI without driving through the 5 boroughs of NYC. There is a tendency for some to use the phrase \"the city\" to refer to Manhattan only.\\nThe routes mentioned take you through the outer boroughs and (often) less congested, less stressful driving routes.\\nAs someone recently moved here you should acquaint yourself with the parkway system https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkways_in_New_York They are for passenger cars only and I find them much more pleasant driving than dealing with all the truck traffic on the Long Island expressway\\nFor future reference, the only other ways to leave LI with a car are via ferry (Port Jefferson to Bridgeport CT or Orient Point to New London CT) Options to keep in mind if ever headed north.\\nAs you get more acquainted with the region you\\'ll get more comfortable with venturing into areas that currently seem intimidating (While I don\\'t particularly enjoy it, I don\\'t find driving through midtown/downtown that stressful - but its because I know the area as both a pedestrian and a driver)\\nI do hope that you have the time to explore. It\\'s an interesting part of the country But it\\'s a slow long haul:\\nhttps://therealdeal.com/2021/06/07/hotels-recovery-taking-longer-in-nyc-than-elsewhere/\\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/hotels/2021/07/28/nyc-hotels-just-had-their-busiest-week-since-the-start-of-the-pandemic/117667710/ Next Summer (hopefully) we are flying up from Jamaica en route to Manchester with an overnight connection. Previously we have stayed near the airport (JFK) but this time will will have a good half day the following day (leaving for the airport approx 2-3pm) so I\\'d prefer to stay closer to the sights.\\nWe\\'d travel to and from the airport with Uber as we\\'ll have large suitcases, and would like to stay somewhere fairly easy to drive to, but which is then close to some of the sights or at least the metro to do some sightseeing. Obviously we can\\'t do a great deal in the timeframe, and as two of my kids haven\\'t been to NY before so I am thinking of staying in the financial district so we can do the 9/11 memorial and maybe the ferry to the Statue of Liberty.\\nPlease can I get opinions from those with more experience - does this sound like a plan or should we consider staying in a different area? Thanks The Financial District is a good base for what you describe. I\\'ve also been able to find some deals there occasionally, and have stayed there (among them. on both of my pre-pandemic visits). Go for it! If you need to travel elsewhere for some sightseeing (perhaps see Times Square lights in the evening?), it\\'s super easy from that area with so many subway lines covering that area. I don\\'t think with limited time I would try to do the statue of liberty. That will take up most of your day right there. It really depends on what you want to see. For someone with limited time and on a first visit I would probably recommend staying in midtown, especially the eastern part of midtown if you are going to Uber (would suggest you look into a car service at least for your ride back to the airport. That way you can avoid any surge pricing via uber. On arrival you can check uber costs and if they are too high you can always get into the official taxi queue. The midtown area is dense with attractions.\\nIf you just mean taking the staten island ferry to see the statue of liberty then staying in the financial district can make sense given the things you wish to see. It really depends on what you want to see AND what you actually have time to see. Ask the kids, if they had one thing to see in NYC, what would it be. I think most kids would say Times Square.. if you don,t want to do that, staying in the financial district is fine. I\\'d take a cruise that gets closer to the Statue rather than the Staten Island ferry. There are some cruises that leave from the South Street Seaport in the financial district. You don\\'t really have time to go to the Statue. Thanks folks, the kids (youngest will be 17) have confirmed that they want to \\'see\\' the statue (so not necessarily go to it) and would like to do the ferry (I suspect there is a Spiderman thing going on here) but a cruise would be fine.\\nThey also really want to do the 9/11 memorial and I would like to return to this as we were quite rushed last time. I would like ideally to be withing walking distance, as despite experience with underground systems around the world I found the NY subway to be somewhat bewildering!\\nWith regards to the cruises, I\\'m thinking that there must be some night time ones so maybe this is how we fit it in?\\nFinal question - would the Financial District / Seaport be good for getting to and from the airport time-wise or would there be somewhere better to stay? Cheers The financial district is fine for getting to JFK whether you take a taxi/car service or the subway.\\nWhen you say “do” the 9/11 Memorial, if you mean go to the museum, book timed tickets in advance.\\nThere are plenty of sunset/evening cruises.but I think only one company leaves from the financial district...pier 36 at the Seaport.\\nhttps://majesticharborcruises.com/cruises/statue-of-liberty-sightseeing-tour/ Persoanlly I would stay at the Marriot Marquis in Times Square If you are going to Manchester, your airline will most likely ask that you be at the airport three hours ahead of time. It will take at least an hour to get to JFK whether you\\'re in midtown or in FiDi. It makes me a bit nervous that you indicated leaving for the airport at \"2-3 pm.\" What time is your flight?\\nBe sure to factor in transport time (whether via subway or cab/Uber, whatever) in between where your hotel is and the cruise or site(s). Lots of folks underestimate that...\\nHave a marvelous trip! Thanks folks. Current flight time looks like 6.40pm but it can (and frequently does) move back an hour if you book a long way in advance.\\nWould you say that the travel time to the airport is the same if you are in Midtown or FiDi? Is there is a better place to stay where we could easily get to the sights that we want? Fidi is actually a bit closer to JFK vs midtown and traffic in Manhattan downtown is easier than midtown.. you\\'ll hit traffic in Queens either way. Staying in Times Square means you have crosstown traffic which is terrible. If you don\\'t want to use the subway, stay downtown. What day of the week is this? Actually drive times are faster from eastern midtown to JFK than from the financial district. We will be driving to NYC and splitting time/people between visiting a cadet at West Point and the tourist spots of NYC. What area would be advised to book at hotel so that the NYC people can use the public transportation and WP people can drive up? I would simply stay in the city. Base the hotel you select on your dates, budget and bedding needs. I don\\'t understand. 1 car? How many people? Is everyone going to West Point? Is everyone doing NYC sightseeing? It is unclear what you are asking\\nDay trips to/from the academy? (Will they be coming to the city to meet you?)\\nA second place to stay near the academy for a couple of days?\\nAre you driving your personal vehicle or considering renting?\\nWill they have a car so they can pick you up at a Metro North commuter train station?\\nYour NYC hotel choice really shouldn\\'t be based on transport to the academy\\nEdited: 4:38 pm, August 12, 2021 Rereading it appears they will be driving their own car and will need parking\\nHow many days will you be here and how many times/days do you plan to go to WP? “The New York people can use public transportation” I assume you mean within New York City?\\n“The West Point people can drive up” I assume you mean to and from New York City &West Point?\\nYou could base your hotel in Manhattan on the Upper west side. This is where I chose to stay when I drove down from Boston , twice. You can drive to West Point to /from there and tour NYC on subways ,buses and walking. You can also garage your car up there and I find the traffic is much less horrendous in this neighborhood. Look on Google maps. It will give you choices of routes.\\nThat’s not the only option , you could really base yourself anywhere in Manhattan. it depends on your comfort level with driving in in Manhattan itself. I don’t mind it , but I still want to drive as little as possible and when you come in from the north it make sense to stay in north Manhattan IMO.\\nEdited: 5:07 pm, August 12, 2021 My understanding is that some of you will be heading to WP while others are not and will be exploring in the city at the same time.\\nTo me, this depends on who has the bigger threshold for travel:\\nIf you want easier, shorter journey into the city? Tarrytown. (~30 min train to city, possible to get an express; just under an hour drive to WP)\\nIf you want easier, shorter journey to West Point,\\nI’d choose Peekskill. (Opposite here: just under 30 to drive to WP, just over an hour to train into the city)\\nBoth cute little towns with restaurants and things to do if you have evenings there together. **If you want easier, shorter journey into the city? Tarrytown. (~30 min train to city, possible to get an express; just under an hour drive to WP)\\nIf you want easier, shorter journey to West Point,\\nI’d choose Peekskill.**\\nJust remember that those taking the Metro North will be paying anywhere from $11.50 > $35 round trip daily depending on which train/location.\\nI would not consider if this is more than a 1 day trip. If you have not already read this, it would be helpful to do so. Note especially the instructions for crossing the George Washington Bridge with what level and lane you ought to be in. Parking at West Point was difficult in the past when anyone could enter. Entry is now restricted.\\nhttps://www.westpoint.edu/visiting-west-point/directions-and-local-conditions Hi! I’m planning on visiting Coney Island but just found out there are fireworks on Fridays.\\nSo, my question is: are they worth it? Are we talking 4 of July or just a little thing? Well, I think they’re worth it - but it depends how much you like fireworks, I guess. It’s not a full-fledged Macy’s July 4-style display, but it’s pretty extensive.\\nPlus the scene on the boardwalk is just plain fun. The 4th of July fireworks are one of the biggest events of the year. Nothing will compare to that.\\nCI\\'s fireworks are very cool. If you pick a nice Friday and are out there, it\\'s a nice think to see. Thank you both!\\nFor future reference: totally worth it to go on a Friday night to Coney Island... not 4th of July, but close enough! Anyone ever stay here? Looks cool but seems like a bit of a travel to get into the city and back.\\nThoughts on this place if you\\'ve been there?\\nWe went for the weekend about 6 weeks ago and everyone was wearing masks on metro north. Wondering if it\\'s still the same? Has the variant increased mask wearing requirements and are people following through?\\nThanks! I would not stay at the TWA if visiting NYC. I might stay there for a night prior to leaving after a visit(a tourist) or leaving for an international trip(local.)\\nI was on the Metro North on Sunday....and multiple times since April/May. I did not see anyone w/o masks this week.. The people who boarded without one were provided masks by the person collecting tickets.\\nI did notice a few people not wearing masks properly or taking them down for an extended period of time. But they really were not close to me. What about if we didn\\'t go into Manhattan and stuck with Brooklyn and Coney Island, etc.\\nOnly one night so enough to do for sure, right? Is that area easy to get around? We would drive to hotel as we live in CT and seems the best option. The TWA hotel is AT the airport. It,s not near enough to a subway station. It would mean driving everywhere....and finding parking. Rockaway Beach isn’t far, but I don\\'t know where you’d park. Ok...if coming in for a night and you are looking for something different...maybe.\\nIt has a rooftop pool, rollerskating, a VERY cool store and possible views of the planes taking off and landing. I visited a while back so you would have to confirm If the store is open.\\nPlus the lobby is amazing!\\nIf you like history and a not so typical day/night in. NYC, it may work.\\nhttps://youtu.be/jbH-eawcZSw\\n^\\nNot my vid. I\\'d consider it IF you\\'ve never explored (and might be interested in) some of things in Nassau county which are more easily gotten to by car\\nMansions? https://www.discoverlongisland.com/trip-idea/long-island-gilded-coast/ There are a couple metro north threads. Mask wearing is still happening there. I believe the MTA requires a mask on all of its transit be it train, subway or bus. NJT requires masks on its trains and strictly enforces the rule.\\nEdited: 7:15 am, August 11, 2021 If you’re planning on traveling by Metro North to NYC, staying at the airport makes very little sense. It will add more than an hour to your trip in each direction. If you want a pool and more of a relaxed visit, there are some hotels in Williamsburg Brooklyn with pools, also near a subway stop. the only reasons to stay at the TWA hotel is either you have to stay in the airport overnight due to a flight change or you specifically want to stay at that hotel We stayed at the TWA Hotel overnight in May as we were traveling Jetblue fairly early the next day. The Hotel has an elevator that puts you directly into the Jetblue Terminal. The Hotel is a ‘trip’ but it is expensive and we did not like the food- overpriced and not good. So I agree with the other posters to\\nstay elsewhere. Enjoy your trip Hey everyone! I have searched everywhere but it seems like C.19 has thrown a loop in the shuttle business between LGA and JFK. I will arrive at LGA at 12pm with a connecting flight at 5:40 from JFK. Is this enough time to take public transport (cheapest option) and what is the recommended route? Thank you! There is no public transportation now. Take a taxi or car service. It¡s enough time if you don,t dawdle. If your flight from JFK is international, you need to be there 3 hrs. Before flight. You could take Q70 Bus from LGA to Jackson Heights Subway and transfer to the e traingoing towards Jamaica, Take E train to Sutphin BLVD and go upstairs for the JFK Airtrain You don\\'t have enough time to take the public transit option\\nQ70 bus > E train > JFK Airtrain https://new.mta.info/map/5256 Is your 5:40 flight International or domestic? Public transit is closed down? That\\'s a bummer. Thank you for the information. It is an international flight, and I was recommended to be at the airport 3 hours before departure.\\nI think I will call them and reroute me. Seems like a better option than dealing with the transfer. :-/ Thank you everyone for your replies!\\nEdited: 8:46 pm, August 11, 2021 Although, I read on MTA that they are back on regular schedule? And it would take a bit over 1 hour to get from LGA to JFK. :-( Was still hoping this is the case, since the route from JFK to Madrid would have be arriving much earlier in the day versus an overnight layover. Take a taxi. It is too complicated to use the subway, bus, etc. People in Flushing near LGA just use car services as it is an easy ride (normally) down an expressway to JFK. The Subway is not closed down\\nAllow 60-90 Mins for this trip via Public transport\\nA taxi is about 30-45 Mins depending on traffic Thank you everyone, and especially Howardform! I will try public transport using the subway, seems like I have at least 2 hours to mess around. Worst case scenario, I will grab a taxi. :-) Cruising taxis are not that common in Queens and if you decide you want to use one after leaving LGA, it may be difficult.

You should double check that JCMTL, that was my hotel for my last stay (Christmas 2019). Highly recommend Leo\\'s Bagels just around the corner. My best friend and I (in our 40\\'s) are coming the NYC in May 2022 for 4 nights. Her 1st time, my 2nd. While we are interested in some of the attractions we are most interested in \"going with the flow\", walking around and enjoying the ambience of different neighborhoods. We would like to stay somewhere close to subways to get wherever we need to but most importantly, has a \"fun\", positive vibe in a neighborhood with restaurants/bars to hang out and enjoy ourselves after sight seeing. Can\\'t afford anything too high end, $400/night would be the max and hope for less. Suggestions for us? What are your exact dates of travel as hotel rates vary daily? Also what is your desirws bedding configuration? Is the $400 inclusive of 15% taxes? Mid May 2022 on one of the weekends, are okay with sharing a king or two twins/doubles, etc. Flexible on this. Yes, would like the $400/night to be inclusive of tax. Union Square, Greenwich Village, or Soho. Also Lower East Side and the East Village.\\nMeatpacking District as well.\\nThere are many trendy and lively hotels in these areas. The Moxy East Village, The Standard East Village (and Meatpacking district), The Ludlow, The Public, CitizenM Bowery are a few to get you started for research. My best friend and I just had a magical week at The Roxy in Tribeca. I\\'d never stayed in the neighborhood and was delighted. Plenty of subway options too. The hotel itself has a fantastic vibe! They aren\\'t showing rates for May yet, but you can get a deluxe king room for $400 on a random weekend in September.\\nThe Soho Grand is its sister property and seems a little less expensive while still giving a fun boutique feel in the same neighborhood. I haven\\'t stayed there so can\\'t vouch for the rooms. I have stayed at Sixty Soho: great location and vibe, with a rooftop bar exclusively for guests. The Ludlow on LES is super fun, but not as many subway options close by.\\nOne last suggestion is The Nomad. They haven\\'t reopened yet, but keep an eye on their website. BFF and I had a beautiful stay there October 2019. The Madison Square Park area isn\\'t quite a hot spot, but the location is very convenient. Keep us updated! Thank-you for all the advice! This is what I was looking for! After sorting through some things I was drawn to the Moxy East Village - looks like a good location? That\\'s probably my current favorite. What about MADE or even the Archer? I do think the Roxy looks amazing!! Thoughts? The Archer is in midtown, not a good area for what you want. Made is not bad, but I think you\\'d be happier in the east village. Just look at the Moxy rooms carefully. They,re really small. The Roxy in Tribeca would be fun too if it\\'s in budget. The location of the Moxy East Village is ideal. We have been Greenwich Village denizens for 50+ years. Here, we like the Washington Square Hotel just across the street from Washington Square Park in the heart of The Village and stay there when family comes to visit NYC and we give them our Village apartment. The area is vibrant with universities and attractions, close to SoHo and Chinatown for shopping, has great outdoor dining and has easily accessible public transportation. Many touristy attractions are within a 1-2 mile stroll from the Hotel.\\nNote: The Washington Square Hotel does not always list all of it\\'s room availabilities on the Internet. We have found that directly contacting the Hotel yields best results. For more information, see:\\nhttps://washingtonsquarehotel.com/\\nCH Awesome! I noticed the Citizen M Bowery hotel also had small rooms and doesn\\'t look as good for two friends sharing a bed as the Moxy (where we can get 2 beds). The Standard East Village which looks great but too pricey. The Public might just be okay for the budget. Is the location of that one or Citizen M Bowery as good the Moxy East Village?\\nEdited: 8:04 pm, July 22, 2021 Hello, I was thinking to visit new york for one day. I will arrive at Penn Station late at night by train. I was wondering can I stick around the Station until daylight or will security kick me out of penn station? I just can\\'t afford a hotel in new york. They have a seating area for ticketed passengers. You usually just show your ticket when entering, but I am not sure if they will check the time. What time are you getting in that will let us know some other potential options (ie diners, Staten Island Ferry) The answer stays the same. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13534921-Art_at_Moynihan_Train_Hall-New_York_City_New_York.html The answer stays the same. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13534921-Art_at_Moynihan_Train_Hall-New_York_City_New_York.html I think the relevant answer was in this thread:\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13603493-Au_Chevil_walking-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThe new Moynihan station closes between 1am and 5am. The old part of Penn Station is open during those hours, but I have no idea what the seating situation is. I know that during peak hours the limited seats in the waiting area at Moynihan - which are only for ticketed passengers - fill up & there’s no public seating.\\nAll in all, not a good plan! The Amtrak waiting area at the Old Penn Station can be used to stay. It is well lit and policed. You just show your train ticket and the attendant will allow you in the waiting area. This is just off the old Amtrak concourse towards 8th Ave. NJT has a small waiting space at the 7th Ave. end, but it is not as nice as the first. People are not chased out of Penn Station and the underground passages have homeless spending the night there. There is no TV or amusements in the waiting room, but only monitors showing the train departures. The room has glass walls and is quite visible to security. I have found it clean and comfortable. One must currently wear a mask in Penn Station. There is nice, clean waiting area in the Moynihan Train Hall. I was able to sit with a laptop and get some work done. As pointed out above, Moynihan is closed overnight, which is what OP is looking for. Are you sure you can\\'t afford a hotel? There are some very basic hotels in Manhattan that may be better than sitting in a room with nothing going on (ok, listening to music, reading a book), but you\\'d be far more refreshed to tackle NYC in a day, with a bit of rest?\\nWhat date are you getting in? Hi, I’m traveling to NYC for my first time with 2 friends in the last week of September. I saw that the best place to stay is in central Manhattan but some of the prices are extremely high. I’m looking for anything around $100-$200 per night preferably 2 queen beds but if they have a rollaway option that would work as well. I’m flying in from Newark is there any hotel there that will be near quick & easy transportation to NYC daily? Or is it a good idea to spilt our stay up between two hotels? Also if I can get any advice for a first timer I would really appreciate it! Groupon has some good deals.\\nWe stayed at the MSocial recently. Good location. Clean. nice staff. Easy to get around from. Great price. Hampton Inn Manhattan-Times Square North has 2 queens and is a bit above your budget but does offer breakfast for free. You may want to consider that. The best place to stay will really depend on what you want to do, where you want to go, but you absolutely do not have to stay in Midtown Manhattan (or split up your trip - New York is big, but it\\'s not quite that big). There are some touristy sites in that area - Times Square (which I don\\'t recommend, but lots of people want to see it), Broadway, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Lincoln Center, Empire State Building, but it\\'s not really the nicest part of the city, in my opinion, and NYC is very easy to get around overall. I\\'d look further uptown or downtown, or in Brooklyn or Queens.\\nWhat other kinds of advice are you looking for? Things to do, how to get around, neighborhoods to visit...? What is your maximum budget per night, including taxes?\\n$100 won\\'t get you anywhere but maybe a hostel. $200 might work. Can you go higher? If you do go with a Jersey hotel staying close to a NJ path train stop is the easiest way into Manhattan, and the hotels there are only a little cheaper. Courtyard by Marriott Jersey City Newport is the best deal I am seeing and for a king with a pull out or two queens it is coming in a little over $200 Are you (or at least one of you) 21+?\\nIf between 18 and 20 you\\'ll be limited in the hotels you can choose Central Park in the autumn is beautiful, so the Hampton would put you closer to there. I always recommend lunch at the boat house and renting a row boat (even the grumpiest of people seem to have fun). Also if you are going to the Statue of Liberty Statue Cruises is the only way to get on the island so book early morning timed tickets with them. Open tickets or group passes get put in a way longer general line.\\nWhen you finish you can do OWO, and lunch at Brookfield Place\\nSimilarly with Empire State Building buy online and show up when they open and it will save you the cost of an express ticket.\\nWhatever you decide Have Fun! We have stayed twice in Long Island City Queens which is just over the bridge from Manhattan. Hotel prices are cheaper, quick subway ride into places like Time Square and often breakfast is included in the cost of the room. >>.I saw that the best place to stay is in central Manhattan but some of the prices are extremely high. I’m looking for anything around $100-$200 per night <<<\\nWithout your exact dates we cannot look at Manhattan hotels to find one within your budget with two beds for the 3 of you. Hotel prices fluctuate by date. Please inform the forum of your dates.\\nAs for whether you should split your stay between hotels , that’s hard to advise too IMO, since we don’t know how long you’re staying.\\nPersonally I don’t change hotels unless I have a two week stay. It’s only a good idea in my opinion if you pack light as well.\\nYou are traveling to see New York City not Newark. I suggest exhausting all possibilities of lodging within budget in Manhattan before you look elsewhere. I think you’ll be able to find a place there for approximately $170- $175 with two beds before taxes in Manhattan. But without dates I cant check to be certain.\\n(Taxes add 15 % and some hotels have resort fees so read the fine print).\\nMy advice for a first time visitor is to install transportation app on your smart phone. I use Citymapper ,it helps me get around the city like an expert. I actually learned how to use the subway & the Geography-just by using this app.\\nHere is a helpful link on **how to get into Manhattan from ALL Airports***. (Newark in your case)\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13187699-How_do_I_get_from_the_airport_JFK_LGA_EWR_to_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nBelow a link by the destination experts of New York City for *First time visitors* to New York City- tips\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k8949287-Tips_Hints_and_Suggestions_for_First_Timers_to_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html Washington Square Hotel is very reasonable on price and gets great reviews! I\\'ll be staying there next month as well! Hi!\\nMy niece and I are scheduled to arrive next Monday August 9 via Amtrak for the gift show at the Javitts staying overnight midtown. We are both vaccinated and mask-wearing but with the rise in cases of the Covid 19 delta variant, I am wondering if it is a wise plan. This is not a HAVE TO trip so I\\'d really appreciate some firsthand advice from folks who spend time in the city on a regular basis. Should we postpone? Thanks. Have you looked at the infection and transmission rates in your home county vs Manhattan? What is your tolerance for risk? None of us are epidemiologists, scientists, or experts in the field (or at least not in our capacity as TA volunteers), so any advice you get here is really just opinion, not fact.\\nI live in Manhattan. I have resumed many normal activities, but I am wearing a mask indoors, and when I’m in a crowded area outdoors (including my home area which tends to be crowded w tourists), I flip my mask on. I spray sanitizer fairly often on my hands and wash when I can, carefully. That’s what I do. You have to make your own decisions about what risks you’re willing to take - every time you walk out your front door (or let a delivery or service person in, you’re taking some kind of risk. It might be possible that new restrictions might be announced this very day following the CDC recommendations. I notice that the worst infection rates are in Monmouth County, NJ. for the whole Phila.-NYC region. Agree with Risa. To my mind, the issue is less about travel per se than what you’ll be doing during your trip. If you’re out and about in your home community, it’s probably not much (or at all) riskier here. I actually feel safer here than in other parts of the state because of the precautions that most people/businesses/institutions continue to follow.\\nIf it were me, I’d probably check with Javits and/or the event organizers to see if masks are required. If they are, I’d be totally comfortable; if they aren’t, I’d be less comfortable, though I might still go.\\nThat’s me, not you…the point is we all make these risk calculations on a daily basis rather we’re traveling or not. Something like the Microcovid tool has helped me think about risk in the past ( https://www.microcovid.org/ ) when I plan. I\\'m sure it\\'s not perfectly accurate but helps quantify risk more when you\\'re thinking about how much risk you\\'re willing to take and what you can do to mitigate.\\nPersonally, we want to keep risks at an acceptable level by changing things in our control first since unfortunately we don\\'t have a lot of control over some external things. Things we can change are masking, vaccination, distancing, air flow and limiting time in more risky situations.\\nWe also booked places to stay where we can refrigerate and warm food and will try to do more outdoor activities when we can. I hope external circumstances don\\'t get a lot worse. I guess we\\'re in for more uncertainty.\\nGood luck with your trip. Who goes to the gift show? Is this a mostly for the trade show? If people were coming from all over the US, I would probably want to know more about what protocols show organizers have in place. I would likely feel uncomfortable if they had a lot of people coming in from the very infected parts of the US -- esp places like Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Vegas, etc. I have read some states and localities are imposing, or thinking of imposing, restrictions on people incoming from Vegas as many COVID outbreaks have been traced to people who recently visited Vegas. Many thanks for your careful and thoughtful replies. It is an international show and both exhibitors and attendees are from all over the world although the latter are mostly from the States and the southern tier of those usually go to their own big markets in Atlanta and Dallas instead of NY. I truly believe that the Javits itself has made extraordinary improvements in improving the air quality and also believe that the crew will enforce mask wearing. We are from a very low infection area. Once again, thank you for your very helpful advice. I agree with all the points above.\\nSince you\\'re vaccinated and comfortable with the need to wear masks in some settings, I think coming is a reasonable choice.\\nIf you haven\\'t been far afield for awhile the idea is initially a little concerning\\nI just took my first journey outside the 5 boroughs this last weekend for an engagement party in Suffolk county. The idea of being around some strangers did cause some pre-trip anxiety but it was a refreshing experience and I\\'m glad I didn\\'t chicken out..\\nBe sure to bring your proof of vaccination - there are only a few places (restaurants, museums) that might currently ask for it but I\\'d want to have it handy just in case Waking up back home after a wonderful two days in NYC, I want to thank everyone who encouraged us to make the trip. I was amazed by the compliance with mask wearing and other safety measures. The show at the Javits and the Moynihan Train Hall were two places where I had the greatest sense of space, safety and, yes, beauty. As for restaurants, we were very well pleased with the barriers, cleanliness and concern for our comfort and safety. So glad we visited and as Kaye in Astoria suggested , glad we didn\\'t chicken out. Thanks again. This is so nice to hear, than you for reporting back…and glad you had a good visit. Hi everyone!\\nI\\'m planning a visit to NY next year and am researching places to eat.\\nWe\\'re staying near Times Square and would like recommendations for the best street food/burger joints to eat? We\\'re fans of the Man V Food TV show, so maybe something that has/should have featured on here.\\nThank you in advance. Water & Hannover and around has awesome Street food Downtown.\\nMidtown ....by Park Ave in the 50s has good too, but i prefer Downtown. Highly minority opinion: I don’t really enjoy street food. But the one food truck I go out of my way for is Sam’s falafel in Zucotti Park. (There’s another falafel truck there, make sure you go to Sam’s). His food is fresh and delicious. When you said “ Burger Joint “ I thought of this place Paul’s Da Burger joint . Has good burgers and inexpensive. It’s a no nonsense place.\\nIreally think it’s the worth trip down there for their burgers, the rest of neighborhood ( east village) itself is worth a walk around for food (expensive delicious hole in the wall places all over the place.)\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5929105-Reviews-Paul_s_Da_Burger_Joint-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nAnother good burger joint is At The Broome Street Bar. They serve theirs with raw onion , fresh tomato on a pita with potato chips on the side . Its reasonably priced too. They have large windows and you can sit there and eat your burger have a beer or a drink and watch all the pedestrians walking around. I like it.\\nOne time I read the reviews here on TripAdvisor or was it on Yelp? Some people describe this place as dive bar. (?) It’s just a regular old Unpretentious bar, not a fancy one with pub food. It’s clean and I found the people working there to be friendly. It’s not like they gush over you … it’s another no nonsense place.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d423520-Reviews-Broome_Street_Bar-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nI don’t eat burgers much at home but I like to try them out in New York City, I’m sure I’ll think of a couple more burger joints to share.\\nEdited: 1:03 pm, August 09, 2021 Have you checked the Man v Food website to see if there is anything that interests that has been on the show? I haven’t looked, what a great idea \"Sam’s falafel \"\\nAgree,,,Sam Falafel is a must try. Probably the best Falafels in the city.\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/sams-falafel-stand-new-york Correction to my post @ 3 about the East Village and I meant to say inexpensive hole in the wall places all over the place, not “ expensive”. 🙄 >>> Agree,,,Sam Falafel is a must try. Probably the best Falafels in the city.<<<\\nSorry, the best would be the King of Falafel and Shawarma. (Just to give the OP another option, lol.) Well, this is a conundrum. I can never say \"the best\" because I haven\\'t tried them all, and that\\'s something I\\'m pretty hard on myself about (my cousin went off on his wife yesterday in my presence for her inexact language, and I had to laugh, must run in the family). All I can say is what works for me. So Linda, have you tried Sam\\'s and found the ones in your post better, or do you just love yours so much you\\'re assuming they\\'re the best? #Inquiringminds\\nAlso, I tend to find these kinds of discoveries on my travels...and of course, Sam\\'s is on one of my usual routes, I had to examine his cart to figure out why he always had long lines. I have been going to NYC once or twice a year for quite a few years now---my favorite vacation place. But, this trip is a little different. To make a long story short, my daughter in law passed away in March from cancer. She and my son had just adopted their \"granddaughter\" as their daughter a few months before her passing. Anyway, her name is Ellie and she is my heart and soul. For Fall break I asked did she want to go to NYC or Disney--and she chose NYC! So, this trip I need to find a room for Ellie (age 8), my son, my niece (adult) and myself. We usually stay at Radio City Apts, or Hotel Wolcott. Had great price for 2 rooms at Wolcott and just found out they were closed the rest of the year. Now, I have room at Radio City but can cancel. Can anyone suggest another hotel with prices $300 or less? It will need to be a suite---or 2 seperate rooms with twin beds??? Also, our arrival time at LGA will be about 10:30 p.m.----will taxi service be available then. I know it should, but with Covid---so many changes I thought I would ask to make sure. Thanks! I meant to add a 2 bedroom suite would be great---googling now to find what hotels offer suites! In general, the hotels that does two bedroom suits - those tend to be rather expensive.\\nHave you looked at Residence Inn Downtown/WTC? All rooms have well equipped kitchenettes. They have some rooms with 2 queen beds. The smallest room type (with a king bed) are rather spacious so I figure their other rooms are as well. There are some one bedroom suits as well. Thanks Maxi-- I just looked---not seperate bedrooms----We have one snorer on CPAP and another snorer--so we need some space! I\\'m soooo sorry to hear about your daughter in law..must be very tough for Ellie.\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nhas 2 bedroom suites but they\\'re pricey but they do have 2 bathrooms. (I assume you know Radio City has 2 bedroom suites, btw.) You might also price out 2 separate studio suites with 2 beds in each if the snorers can bunk together.\\nThe Newton Hotel is another good budget option. There should be plenty of taxis but given the size of your party, you might want to order a car service to guarantee a larger vehicle.\\nCarmellimo.com\\nDial7.com Thank you NYWHIZ-- I have a 2 bedroom suite at Radio City but can cancel if I find a cheaper hotel. We are going to take \"carry on\" bags only---think we still need a larger vehicle? I hadn\\'t even thought of this! Thanks for your kind words for Ellie. Will check Beacon and Newton now---thank you. I\\'m so sorry about your loss. And you\\'re so wonderful to make this so special for Ellie. Hope you have a wonderful time in NYC!\\nThere \"should\" be plenty of taxis, but the later it gets, the longer the lines as there have been less drivers. So, I agree, consider reserving a car with Carmel or Dial 7. And you can order a larger car for your group. Will be going to city for a wk at the end of Aug., to move daughter into an apt in Lenox Hill. Looking for reasonably priced hotel that is at least 3+ stars ( clean, quiet, and updated).\\nThe Warwick, Bentley & Fitzpatrick pop up in my searches…? Would love some input.\\nThnx If you want other options, you need to say what YOU consider “reasonable” and when you\\'ll be here since hotel prices fluctuate by date. It would also help to know what you plan to do while here. Is it all about moving in and shopping for the apt.? Are you a walker? Would you prefer to be able to walk to/from the apt from the hotel?\\nI assume you know there are hundreds of reviews here on TripAdvisor for every hotel. Read the most recent reviews for the 3 you listed. ALSO, there are photos of the rooms at each linked on the review page. The Warwick and the Fitzpatrick have very traditional decor. Not sure what you mean by updated. Finally, I assume you\\'ve looked at a map and see where these are relative to the apt.\\nThe Bentley is in a very residential area near a lot of hospitals. It\\'s the only one I checked for reviews. Apparently they closed during Covid and haven’t given people a refund.\\nEdited: 6:19 pm, August 09, 2021 thanks for you input - by last week of Aug. I meant approx 30th through 9/6....Updated means, not in need of a refresh. Many places that were good awhile back, are in need of a \\'refresh\\'.\\nI\\'ve done a bit of research already, and was looking for some input of suggestions. Reviews are sometimes all over the place - \"It was fabulous\" vs \"would never stay there again\", so I usually have better luck w/ folks on TA.. And lastly, reasonable for a trip like this would be $180- 230. I know that prices are usually pretty good for places during July and August, and thinking might be even more \\'reasonable\\' this year. Also know there are not many hotel options on upper east side, unless you go high end on Mad/5th....so being in the 50s will work...\\nThanks, Are you talking about the Fitzpatrick on Lex near 57th? That was closed for a really long time, though may have recently reopened. The Fitzpatrick down on E 44 near Grand Central has been open for a year or more. I heard a few months ago the Bentley was being used to house people from the Doe Fund, though may no longer be true. The Doe Fund provides job opportunities (street cleaning, etc.) for men trying to turn their lives around (often recently released from prison or recovering from substance abuse). I have never heard any complaints about them but is something you might want to be aware of.\\nGenerally speaking, exactly where in Lenox Hill is your daughter going? Old timers may consider it a relatively small area in mid and upper 70s between Park and Third. Others ( including RE brokers) may consider it anything on east side north of Bloomingdale\\'s, in which case there could be other places in east midtown that might be convenient for you.\\nEdited: 8:00 pm, August 09, 2021 In 50s on east side you would also have places like Courtyard, Affinia 50, Benjamin, Kimberly, San Carlos. The Jewel, a Club Quarters Hotel is another option on W 51st St near Rock Center.\\nGood Luck, stay safe & I hope you enjoy your time in NYC! Look at the Concorde.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d14040955-Reviews-Concorde_Hotel_New_York-New_York_City_New_York.html Fitzpatrick on Lex… it’s showing up on all the sites. My girl is going to be on 74th & 2nd. That was one I was looking at - wondering if anyone has any input on it… reviews are not consistent Thnx- I’ll check it out That is really interesting to see nywhiz mention the Concorde (on E 55 between Park & Lex). I walk by it often but have never seen anyone coming or going, so wondered if it was some sort of special private hotel, or long term only or something like that. There is another newer hotel on a crosstown block near there that I have also never seen anyone enter or leave; will have to look into that one.\\nBecause of your daughter\\'s location I would recommend staying on east side. You\\'ll have subways, buses (uptown on 3d and 1st, downtown on Lex and 2d), plus a fairly quick cab trip without having to worry about slow crosstown traffic.\\nEdited: 10:24 pm, August 09, 2021 Hi all,\\nMy daughter is arriving into JFK and has to transfer to George Washington Bridge Station to catch a bus to Ithaca. What is the best way for her to do that as she will have a lot of luggage with her? I seem to remember a bus going from JFK direct to Port Authority years ago but cannot find anything similar for GW Bridge Station.\\nMany thanks in advance for your replies. **What is the best way for her to do that as she will have a lot of luggage with her?**\\nIt depends on what you consider \"best\".\\nI would simply take a cab. Transit options are limited and time consuming https://goo.gl/maps/G9sjqMRDPuQRDA217\\nSince she has substantial luggage I don\\'t think transit is a good idea\\nYellow cabs are a fixed rate between JFK and anywhere in Manhattan https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/taxi-car-and-van-service ~$75 after tip, surcharges and possible tolls. She should *only* use the dispatcher line outside the terminal. Ignore any touts offering (illegal) rides I\\'m leaning that way myself. It\\'s a bit more awkward with luggage and having to transfer a couple of times. Thank you for your reply. Thank you very much for your reply. I will look into the links you sent. This is really easy to do(if taking a cab.)\\n-Have her wait on the official taxi line outside the terminal.\\n-Tell the dispatcher she is going to the GWB station on 178th off Broadway.\\n-Tell the driver that she is going to the GWB station on 178th off Broadway.\\n-Sit back and relax.\\nNote....the official taxis are YELLOW in color. No one inside the terminal is supposed to solicit rides. If anyone asks her if she needs a cab....simply have her say....\"I\\'m good\"....and keep walking. If your daughter is going to Cornell and has Cornell ID, she should look into the university\\'s bus service between Ithaca and its 3 NYC campuses\\nhttps://fcs.cornell.edu/departments/transportation-delivery-services/campus-campus-bus-service/c2c-stop-locations She should *not* leave the cab dispatcher line even if a sort-of official looking tout approaches her with the lie that there is a shortage of cabs. (For security reasons most Yellow cabs are in a waiting area and the dispatchers call them up to the terminals as needed)\\nOnce in the cab the meter on-screen rate message should read \"Rate #2- JFK Airport.\" https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page\\nSurcharges will be automatically added to the final total\\nAll toll crossings within the city limits are cashless and any tolls are automatically added when the vehicle passes under the toll sensors\\nWith the fixed rate the driver has an incentive to take you the fastest way. I think going via the RFK/Triboro toll bridge is the most likely route for this destination\\nShe should also make a note of the vehicle number and get a receipt And this destination is definitely the FIXED rate into Manhattan, not on the meter. Thank you so much to all for your replies. I see Megabus has a run to Ithaca at 8 am and 6 pm from the 42nd St. PABT if that is of any help. That is a far more convenient place to reach from JFK. Hi all, first time to NYC here, 9th wedding anniversary with my wife who\\'s been before. Arriving in Newark 9a 9/2, departing same 8p 9/5.\\nSaw some advice on here that said to stay in Manhattan, rather than Newark, if you can afford it. Looks we can. Budget: $150-175/night.\\nNot renting a car.\\nHow do you recommend getting from the airport to hotel?\\nWhich hotel do you recommend near lots of the typical tourist spots?\\nHow do you recommend working in a trip to the new WTC and memorial, as well as the statue? Should we stay a night in Brooklyn?\\n9/2 is our anniversary, and would like to get a Michelin-starred place, but trying to keep it around $150pp. Recommendations?\\nWant to see the Met, Grand Central, Central Park, maybe MOMA and Coney Island. Also taking recommendations for more standard and not-so-standard tourist spots.\\nRelevant COVID information also appreciated!\\nEdited: 2:14 pm, August 07, 2021 I wouldn\\'t change hotels for such a short visit. You can visit Brooklyn easily even if you stay in Manhattan. Book SOL-tickets for the earliest time slot you can one morning. After that, visit 9/11 memorial. Do you mean you want to visit One World Observatory as well? It\\'s certainly possible.\\nDo you have preferences (likes / dislikes) when it comes to food? Marea is lovely. I think it\\'s a one star Michelin now, used to be two. If you like fish and seafood with Italian flavors, this could work for you - depending on what you choose to order. Don\\'t know if they still have prix fix menus in these post-Covid times, but they used to in the past. We\\'re omnivores and foodies, so there isn\\'t much that we\\'d turn away as a recommendation, thank you.\\nI forgot to mention a very important piece of the puzzle here... on 9/2 and 9/3, I will be working roughly 10a-4p in the hotel on wi-fi :(. So tips on what to squeeze in on those evenings are important!\\n9/2 as I said is our anniversary, so that will be the dinner night.\\nWhat are SOL tickets?\\nEdited: 2:34 pm, August 07, 2021 >>>How do you recommend getting from the airport to hotel?<<<\\nHow do I get from the airport (JFK, LGA, EWR) to Manhattan?\\nAnswered here in THIS LINK ;\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13187699-How_do_I_get_from_the_airport_JFK_LGA_EWR_to_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html Sorry!!

Congratulations. Your hotel budget is very low for an anniversary worthy hotel on Labor Day weekend. Remember taxes add 15% and some hotels add a resort fee. The Wall St. Inn (booked on Agoda ) could work. What options did you see?

A co worker of mine was in the Poconos and found a Citi Bike chained in front of supermarket. It’s an easy scam to avoid - at least if you’re aware of it, which I wasn’t until this post. My takeaways are to steer clear of - or at least be careful of - bike stations where people are loitering (though teens often sit on the bikes innocently, just to hang out). Avoid bikes where the QR code shows signs of tampering. Or use your credit card and/or a manual code to unlock the bike instead of your phone.\\nI have an annual membership so I don’t know the details of how the individual rides/day passes used by tourists work, but I suspect most rely on their credit cards, which would protect them.\\nI don’t think these clunky Citibike’s have any market value, so it really is more about joy riding (or just being a jerk) than theft for profit. Hopefully that will limit its spread.\\nLike I said, I use Citibike multiple times a day, virtually every day, and have never encountered or even heard of this until now. \"I don’t think these clunky Citibike’s have any market value, so it really is more about joy riding (or just being a jerk) than theft for profit. \" Not sure the basis of this statement. Have seen a number of stories of people being robbed of their citibikes across NYC. Below is an article about how bike theft rose quite a bit during the pandemic and also just a youtube from when actionkid was walking around and he caught an attempted citibike theft. Just because it hasn\\'t happened to you doesn\\'t mean its not a risk and people should be aware of how quickly bikes can be stolen. People steal scrap metal from construction yards to sell for crying out loud.

The fact that Citibike’s are expensive to replace doesn’t mean they have much street value.\\nOrganized theft of regular bikes, in contrast, is rampant & a big problem - for delivery ebikes, even more so. In fact, one of the reasons I like Citibike so much is that I don’t need to worry about my bike after I dock it.\\nI truly do appreciate your bringing this to visitors’ attention, but for the reasons I tried to explain in earlier posts, it’s hard to imagine it being a big issue for visitors - especially if they’re aware, as they are now.

You may sing, dance, craft, swim, slide, climb, laugh, smile, lick and even hug...and most definitely EAT with treats included in your ticket.\"\\nThey have a Daytime experience and a Nighttime experience that seem to be different.\\nhttps://tickets.museumoficecream.com/tickets/MOICnyc Hello! Heading to NYC in a few days with several 15 year olds, boys and girls. Because there is no theater yet, I\\'m a bit at a loss about night time activities. We might go to Little Island one night. They are having performances. But I\\'m not sure what else. Most of the comedy clubs require you to be 18+ or 21+. VR World seemed like a good idea, but that\\'s also 18+ after 5PM. There aren\\'t even many good movies out. There are some things like jazz clubs. I don\\'t know how into that they would be. I\\'m familiar with piano bars...not sure if they would like that or if there are also age requirements. Any suggestions? Thanks! Depends on what you have planned for daytime activites.\\nSome things can be done at night would be for example Empire State Building and Staten Island Ferry. If the weather is nice, hang out in Washington Square Park and people watch - have dinner in the area. From your question, I gather what your interests are and that these kids have money to spend. It will help us if we understood how many kids and what nights you are actually here. If it\\'s really a few days from now you have really left this until the last minute.\\nI will suggest the Staten Island Ferry or the Circle Line for now. Sorry! I guess I should have said I lived in NYC when I was younger. And these kids have all been to NYC before....so not like the typical tourist stuff. We will be spending some time in Washington Square Park. Just three nights, but I\\'m really just looking for something fun for one night. Normally I would choose a play or musical but there\\'s not much playing. I did suggest the Stranger Things parody because we\\'d seen Puffs when my son was younger and it was actually pretty funny, but I don\\'t think the other adults were into that idea. Sorry. 3 kids. August 13th is the date I\\'m most interested in. I have exhausted Time Out NY and Thrillist and all of the places I would normally look. Caveat looked great but it\\'s 21+. Just about all of the fun places were in the evening.\\nAs for what else we have planned, Friday the LES and Chinatown and wandering into the Village. Cat cafe (got reservations) Girls want to thrift. I have various food places and stores to check out and then Washington Square Park. I went to college there....kind of want my son to get a sense of it.\\nSaturday more Chelsea. Going to the High Line and maybe Little Island later. We have tickets. Arctechhouse and dinner reservations and probably Chelsea Market. I think there\\'s also a big street fair near Times Square that day.\\nWe get in Thursday night. No plans then, but that\\'s okay. And leave Sunday.\\nEdited: 12:35 pm, August 09, 2021 At 15 have them get on line and see what they come up with.\\nMight also suggest you do some riding on some of our ferries ferry.nyc . I didn\\'t particularly like the Van Gogh exhibit but your kids might. And as Petra already said, all of our observation decks are open in the evening.\\nIf you and they have all been to NYC why are you asking a group of unknown size to come up with something for you to do on 1 unknown evening? Lol. I don’t know! Because I’m an obsessive planner and the other moms aren’t. 😂 And I looked at everything I could think of! It was kind of a last attempt. I’m sure we will find something. I didn’t realize just how many things in NYC were 21+ because I’ve not been when we couldn’t see shows. This was a sort of last minute thing. And there were some ideas I threw out, like karaoke, that nobody else liked. Thanks! If I come up with something, I’ll post some maybe someone else can use the idea in the future. I did pretty well planning out the days and got tickets, so give me a little credit. I was really bummed that VR world was 18+ after 5pm. That would have been fun. Have they seen Stomp?

I need to have a PCR test to return home. Any recommendations re: location, cost turnaround time? Some of the sites seem really expensive. Thanks for the help! Are you American? If so, your insurance will cover it. If not, please advise. It seems that there are places that charge anywhere from $150-400, but I have heard about one or two for about $75. I just don\\'t know anything about them or the reliability. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13553011-PCR_COVID_testing_in_the_city-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThere are several threads on the forum on this topic. Above is a fairly recent one. If it doesn\\'t answer your question, I suggest you search the forum. No, I\\'m Canadian. Thanks again for the help. I have no idea as to how much it would be for non-Americans, but try the websites of CityMD, ModernMD, and NY Hospitals. The first 2 are private, the 3rd is the public hospital system of NYC. There are labq vans in various locations around the city (the locations change from time to time and are different on weekends). I don’t know how they charge for non-US residents, but I’ve used them a couple of times and it’s been free and results come in a few hours.

Every Hilton will have 2 bedded rooms but whether they,re available for your dates is another story. The Conrad downtown is a Hilton option with some 2 double suites. If you\\'re not set on a Hilton hotel, the Courtyard Downtown Manhattan is another consideration. Not sure about availability at this late stage though. It\\'s still fairly new and has rooms that look out towards the Hudson River or down towards Governor\\'s Island or overlooking the 9/11 Memorial and the WTC buildings, depending on which room type you select.\\nThe Memorial view rooms have a really lovely view of the downward fountains and the surrounding buildings and plaza, especially at night. It\\'s very serene and pretty with all the lights.\\nThe hotel also has a 6th floor outdoor terrace overlooking the Memorial and plaza. It\\'s only small but there are a few tables and chairs out there (pre-covid anyway). On a warm September night that would be a nice place to sit. Sorry, just saw that the Courtyard is temporarily closed and I don\\'t know if it would be open in September. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

It\\'s just a short, few minutes walk from the Millennium. It has large rooms, and is pretty fresh. It\\'s sort of in between the Millennium and the Artezen that you mentioned location wise.\\nThere\\'s also an Aloft hotel pretty near the Artezen so it\\'s also in a good location. Does anyone know if the roof bar area is open at the Art House on the upper west side? Their website says nothing about a rooftop bar, only their first floor restaurant and bar. No recent reviews say anything about the rooftop either.\\nBut you could give them a phone call and ask just to be sure: https://www.arthousehotelnyc.com/ They used to have a bar on the 16th floor, I had a private party there for my 50th. I would call and ask if it is still open. I think they\\'re just using it for private events now. I\\'m glad to know I hadn\\'t missed out on something awesome when we stayed there! I love a rooftop bar! But, I never saw signs or info about when we stayed there and now I know why. We really liked the hotel and especially loved the location. Hi all,\\nLooking for a hotel with rooms on a low floor, central enough. Have a bad fear of lifts have been to New York before and managed a full week without one.\\nPreferably 4/5 star.\\nThanks There may be some exceptions but \"every hotel\" is the answer to which have rooms on lower floors.\\nBut being able to access them via stairs may be a different story. (not in NYC but I\\'ve asked to use the stairs at plenty of hotels and been told they are only open as a fire escape)\\nI doubt availability of stairs is something published so I\\'d suggest researching based on other criteria and calling them about not using the elevator to get to your room and assuring you get one of the lower rooms. I\\'d have to agree with Hank. There are plenty of hotels with low floors but getting access to their stairwell is another issue, as it\\'s often reserved only for emergencies. If you call the group sales or concierge person for any hotel it\\'s probably the fastest way to getting an answer.\\nDiane\\nNYC Photo Safari I know the Element on 39th street (or nearby) does as they have slow elevators and the low floors are desirable .\\nBut yes, most hotels have rooms on floor 2 or 3. We stayed at the Hotel St. James (W45th) and used the stairs often instead of the elevator with no issues. This is not a 4/5 star hotel but shows that stairs are in use and not blocked.\\nEdited: 11:10 am, August 08, 2021 The past two hotels we\\'ve stayed in had rooms on low floors and stairway access. One was the previously mentioned Element Times Square on 39th the other was the Fairfield Inn and Suites on west 58th. The Fairfield was quite a bit nicer than the Element, imo, but was a bit out of the way with the 2.5 block east/west walk to Columbus Circle for transit (though we didn\\'t mind much).\\nI\\'d suspect many hotels that take the entire building and don\\'t fill all their lower floors with convention rooms will have lower rooms. I know we stayed in a more luxury-oriented hotel nearer the U.N. at one point that didn\\'t, but it was because the hotel portion didn\\'t take the entire building and rooms were only on upper floors.\\nI think you\\'ll find hotels happy to accommodate if they can since many people prefer higher floors for the views. This is a somewhat frequent question. The Casablanca and the Algonquin are 2 options in midtown west that are 4*.with stairs leading to the lobby. I think the Elysee (same group as the Casablanca) may also be an option in midtown east. The Inn at Irving Place is in a brownstone. There are over 84,000 elevators in NYC and one rarely hears of problems. Living with this disability is a great difficulty in a vertical city like NYC. >>Have a bad fear of lifts have been to New York before and managed a full week without one.<<<\\nOut of curiosity which hotel did you use last time? I must assume that that one is unavailable.\\nThe Marlton in Greenwich Village has a staircase available to get all floors, As does the Washington Square hotel also In GV, but the latter isnt a four-star hotel. ( But you did say “preferably a four-star” so perhaps you’re open ?)\\nThe Inn at Irving Place in Gramercy/Union Square is housed A beautiful restored Brownstone . It has no lift/elevator and is a walk up, but the Inn isn\\'t excepting reservations at this time. Note that some 4 and 5 star hotels have things like ballrooms, conference rooms, offices, on 2d, 3d floors.\\nEdited: 6:52 pm, August 08, 2021 I will be taking the Air Train from JFK to Howard Beach station. Iwill I be able to purchase a senior Metrocard at one of the terminals. It was suggested I purchase a 7 day card, but where? Metrocards can be purchased at the Howard Beach (or Jamaica) Airtrain terminals https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/air-train\\nYou cannot get a reduced fare Metrocard without a personalized card https://new.mta.info/fares/reduced-fare Options for showing proof of age at an attended subway booth to purchase reduced fare are limited at this time So in answer to your question\\nYou can,t buy Mterocards at the air terminals. You can buy a regular 7 day Metrocard at Howard Beach but not a reduced fare. If you want, you can just buy a pay as you go MetroCard to get to your destination and then to go get a senior card the next day. HI Everyone,\\nI am visiting family on the East Coast and planning a one day/overnight trip to NYC for the first time.\\nI don\\'t have time for any museums/historical sights. But would be interested in Italian Cultural, Liz Lemon Culture and Pizza/Italian Food Culture\\nAny recommendations?\\nSo far I have 30 Rock & Little Italy If you\\'re going to Little Italy (now mostly a tourist stop) Rubirosa is not far and has great thin crust pizza. You can get slices at lunchtime but in the evening they only serves pies.\\nThere are several pizza tours. Good list here too.\\nhttps://www.scottspizzatours.com/pizzerias/ Thanks nywhiz\\nIs Little Italy silly to go see, is there a more appropriate Italian Community.\\nWe have North Beach here in San Francisco thats like a lot of Italian Restaurants and stores. It can be touristy but not as crazy as like Pier 39, which is a tourist trap. Little Italy is a very small area, pretty much overtaken by Chinatown. By all means walk through it. Doesn\\'t take that long. But if you\\'re looking for Italian restaurants, there are so many good ones all over Manhattan - mostly outside of Little Italy. Do you have any preferences for regional Italian cuisines and do you need any recommendations? Go to Arthur Ave in The Bronx for Italian culture in concentrated form. You\\'ll find lots of Italian food and traditions there.\\nhttps://www.arthuravenuebronx.com/\\nIn Manhattan, Italian restaurants are spread all over the place but there are good ones there too. Arthur Ave in the Belmont Section of the Bronx is the real Italian food section. Its not far from the Botanical Garden It\\'s a first visit\\nThey only have one day\\nI wouldn\\'t recommend a schlep to the Bronx with such limited time They are looking for the real Italian food, If thats all they want then go to Artur Ave.\\nIf they had other plans then I would not go there I don\\'t know how old your kids are but they might actually enjoy Rockefeller Center (Liz Lemon Culture). There is top of the rock from which you can see Central Park during the day. There\\'s also the NBC store, FAO Schwartz, Nintendo and Lego stores.\\nIn Little Italy you can get a few good Italian products at Di Palo\\'s If you want to visit a non-touristy, historically Italian neighborhood outside Manhattan (and I realize that’s a big if), Carroll Gardens in Brooklyn is a quick trip on the F train to Carroll St…much easier to get to than Arthur Av. CG is now heavily gentrified, but retains a decent number of old-school Italian businesses and institutions (bakeries, barber shops, pork stores, one of the city’s remaining Italian social clubs).\\nHere’s a semi-recent blog post describing the area (and my favorite Italian bakery):\\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/notanotherbrooklynblog.com/17434\\n(It’s my blog, but non-monetized so I hope this bit of self promotion is ok). #9 - For me at least, the WP link takes me to a log in screen (so must click on the option to go to the blog URL https://notanotherbrooklynblog.com/ )\\nWhat is the post date of the Carroll Gardens entry mentioned?\\nEnjoy your birding and eating adventures Staying in midtown and looking for something to do tomorrow!\\nI’m thinking a yummy brunch and neighborhood stroll for some shopping. Not really interested in high end or clothing stores.... more interested in unique gift shops, housewares, food shops, etc.\\nI was thinking of Bleecker Street... any comments in that as a choice and a route to follow as we walk? Or any better places?\\nAll we’ve done so far shopping wise is Chinatown.\\nThank you so much! You’re on the right path. Check out Shuka or 12 Chairs for brunch and walk from there. (But If neither appeals to you, head to Bleecker as you planned and wander in to something that looks good. You can’t go wrong!). Thank you so much! Would you just stay on Bleeker? Would love to know if you have a certain route to walk! And I’ll look up those brunch spots now!! Thanks! Another option:\\nBanter\\nIf you want to hang out in East Village for a bit, it can be combined with walking Bleecker then Veselka is an option. I don’t have a particular route. I’ve walked the length of Bleecker St from west to east and it’s a great walk. You can feel the neighborhood change from high end pricey stores to more college-y and a sense of the music history to the funkier east village. If you do that, then you will pass place your may want to eat or eat at Gemma which is on Bowery close to the end of your walk on Bleecker. Had Vselka last night!! Great recommendation! Glad you liked it! Are there any coupons available? Reading old posts and there used to be. Also, just want to double check that the only way from Terminal 5 is the airtrain to the long term parking? (we will have a lot of luggage)Thanks! If you are comfortable using off airport sites, some have shuttle buses. This is one site\\nhttps://www.aardwolfparking.com/\\nIf you stay with JFK understandably, then I am not seeing any current coupons and the bus to AIrtrain would be your way to your terminal.\\nHope this helps, Safe travels!\\nEdited: 8:59 am, August 08, 2021 Thank you! Just to clarify that if we use the Port Authority Long term, we CAN take the airtrain direct from the parking lot to the terminal? Or do you have to take a bus to the airtrain.

There is no park across the street from #8 in Flushing. There is a sort of alley with a few tree planters on which one can sit. The large number of passersby makes it an unpleasant place to eat. I hardly ever spend more than $15 for a meal. Sorry this is a silly list.\\nMost places in NYC are less than $15 I always love these round-ups! I’ve been to a few (King of Falafel & Shawarma, whose praises I’ve sung here; Lamoon; Grandchamps), made note of others (Santa Clarita, Lagman House), and am now intrigued by a bunch more.\\nSome of the places on this list are admittedly far from typical tourist destinations. But the thing is, if you’re a little bit adventurous and willing to go a bit off the beaten path, you can find literally hundreds of comparably-priced - and equally delicious - places around the city. Lots of visitors are interested in Coney Island; the trip there takes you through a bunch of neighborhoods rich in small restaurants run by immigrant families. Depending on what train you take, the food could be Central/South American, Chinese, West Indian, Turkish, Russian, Uzbek, Georgian… I haven\\'t been to any of these places on this list - and am not tempted to go to any if they are not on my route. I don\\'t see that most are convenient for most tourists - it\\'s more a list for locals (but even for me, I can\\'t imagine traveling way out of my way to save money...when if that\\'s my plan, there are places to go within a block).\\nThere are hidden gems that aren\\'t expensive all over the place...I had to go to Scarsdale today. Within a 5 minute walk from the train station, there is a fabulous French bakery. I mean, it\\'s SO good - so much better than Frenchette Bakery, geometrically better than Ceci-Cela, not in the same breath as Balthazar. Every time I have to go to Scarsdale (maybe 2-3 times a year? Maybe less?) I make sure I stop there. I wish I could bottle the smell of that place - I would make a fortune in selling candles that smelled like it. Would I tell a tourist to sit on Metro North for an hour to get the best croissant or palmier there? Absolutely not. But if you\\'re in the neighborhood, yeah, absolutely. It\\'s about 1/2 to 2/3 the cost of Frenchette Bakery, which I suppose makes it a bargain. But if you have to go out of your way for it, it\\'s no bargain. That\\'s how I see this list. Mostly useless for tourists. But sure...interesting to know you can eat for $15 or less in NYC. PS (too late to edit): that\\'s not to say that tourists in search of interesting food experiences shouldn\\'t travel for food. It just seems that many want to eat on the go, where it\\'s reasonably convenient, not go way out of their way (as much as I think NYC has a wealth of food worth travelling for). Of course, for those on food expeditions, this is an aspirational list to hit.

Of course, for those on food expeditions, this is an aspirational list to hit. I agree with Risa, Unless you are going on a specific food Crawl , it doesnt really pay to travel too far for food.\\nI know one of the best Falael places in NYC and its like $5, but its also in the Middle of Brooklyn and it would take 30-45 Mins to get there from Midtown, Unless you are in the immediate area , which you likely arent unless you know someone there, I would not recommend going there (Its possible this place isnt there anymore as I havent been in that area since before Covid) I am not travelling to Brooklyn for Falafel For me the appeal isn’t saving money (though that’s always nice)…it’s learning about cultures and neighborhoods. This and other Eater lists are encyclopedic (covering the five boroughs and New Jersey), which I kind of like - if I know I’m going to be in a particular area, I’ll often use these compilations to get ideas.\\nBut they’re also arbitrary, in that there are hundreds (heck, probably 1000s) of other worthy places. I would hate for people to use this as a checklist, rather than an invitation to explore the city for themselves.\\nEdited to add - Howard, not sure where your falafel place is, but tourists travel through Brooklyn *all the time* to get to Coney Island. So I’d think food/neighborhood recommendations along the way would be useful to many.\\nEdited: 9:38 pm, August 05, 2021 Seeking a nice hotel perhaps with a roof top far near Clinton Hill or accessible to CH via train: FCA or G. Moderate priced for an Aug. weekend. Thanks in advance.Please share based on personal experiences. We need your exact dates of travel, budget including 15% taxes & desired bedding configuration. 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge is walking distance from Cobble Hill. (oops!) And Clinton Hill is 20 minutes via subway, which is great.\\nI love this part of Brooklyn because the BB is very close to reach downtown Manhattan, you have wonderful views and Court Street restaurants/businesses are nearby.\\nEdited: 1:13 pm, August 07, 2021 Budget is 200 ish per night and there are two so queen or king....Dates are Aug. weekend. We are not going into the city but bouncing from W\\'Burg to Clinton Hill I thought of the William Vale Hotel in Williamsburg because that has a fantastic rooftop plus a pool for guests which is the largest hotel pool in the city. It\\'s way over your budget though.\\nOpposite the William Vale are a couple of hotels you could look into but I think they\\'re also out of price range (hotels are so expensive on August weekends it seems). They are The Whythe hotel and the McCarren Hotel & Pool. They both seem to be over your budget but you could go to the William Vale rooftop (with a reservation).\\nOthers to look into are the Williamsburg Hotel (that has a very cool water tower rooftop), and The Hoxton (don\\'t what amenities they have there). Hi everyone, looking to bring the family to Manhattan this weekend to do a bit of shopping and sight seeing around 5th Ave area. Would we be able to find parking garages to park for the day? Or is this completely a terrible idea and we should consider taking the train into Manhattan? We\\'re coming from central/northern CT if that matters.\\nThanks Not necessarily\\nlF the driver is comfortable and you intend to park once and then do your sightseeing by foot or public transit (Moving from garage to garage would be time consuming and costly)\\nDepending on the number in your group, parking and tolls may be less than the costs of a round trip on the Metro North\\nUse sites like Best Parking, Spot Hero and Icon parking to locate, comparison price and even reserve a spot. (IF driving an SUV or mini-van check if an oversize fee might apply)\\nA traffic & navigation app like WAZE can be useful Thank you, we\\'ll check those sites for sure.\\nAre there any garages that you would recommend? We intend to park somewhere near Saks so it\\'s easier to do shopping on foot. I believe this is where most of the stores are located? Use Spothero or similar to find the best price near your destination. If you come in on Sunday, you are allowed to park on the Streets of Manhattan. This is SUNDAY\\'s only Generally speaking (and there are always exceptions), the closer to Fifth Ave that you park, the more expensive it is to park. The further east or far west you go, the cheaper it is. My NJ family and Westchester . LI, and CT friends and family drive in all of the time, park the car, and then do whatever they do in Manhattan by cab or public transportation. I suppose I should say that environmentally, the train is a better option. But convenience-wise, driving in is a no-brainer, instead of being locked to train schedules.\\nI have to admit I personally just pick the closest parking garage to where I\\'m going, when I\\'m driving. It\\'s not that I like blowing money away...but when I\\'m on an outing, the convenience factor outweighs saving a few bucks. It\\'s never enough savings to make it worth it (to me). But you should do whatever works for you and your family. The recommendations for spothero or tried and tested on this site. **Not necessarily\\nlF the driver is comfortable and you intend to park once and then do your sightseeing by foot or public transit**\\nAgree with ^.\\nI would also try to drive in early on Saturday. Saturday is Summer Streets in NYC and it could be nice detour prior to shopping.\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/summerstreets/html/home/home.shtml The Port Authority recently mentioned that bridge and tunnel traffic had returned to pre-pandemic levels. Subways and trains still have lower usage. My opinion is it\\'s a terrible idea and you should take the train. Yes, there is parking, but it\\'s all garages (unless you somehow find street parking, which in that area would be about the same odds as winning the lottery and getting struck by lightning), and it\\'ll be expensive. It\\'ll also take you a while and be a huge hassle to get to Fifth Ave, which is pretty much smack in the middle of Manhattan. I went to\\nSpothero.com\\nput in Saks Fifth Ave. as location and picked Sat. From noon to 9 pm. I was stunned that there are several places where parking is only $25 for those 9 hrs. right nearby. That said, the most expensive stores are in that area. Soho has more of a selection of stores at all prices. Looking there, there are still plenty of affordable options. I think you need to preplan which stores you want and then look on google maps for locations. I don\\'t know how summer streets will affect your plan. Could be more difficult to get to a garage. Arriving from Dublin via Delta to JFK T4. Will take the Delta shuttle from T4 to T2. Trying to catch an earlier connection at T2 to avoid a 5 hour layover but have only one hour to do so.\\nDublin has pre-clearance. Any chance I can do this? I’m in the first row just behind first class (Prem Comfort) on the DUB flight.\\nTIA This is all on one ticket and both flights are Delta? Even before covid the minimum connection time was just over an hour when switching terminals I to D coming from Dublin. I wouldn\\'t count on being able to make that connection during Covid as it is unclear how quickly the shuttles are running etc. For quite awhile terminal 2 was closed. On separate tickets I think this is a total non-starter. It’s 1 ticket but agree likely over ambitious at this time. Hi. I’m a frequent lurker here but haven’t seen anything lately about taxis from LGA. I will arrive this Thursday around 9am. Can anyone share experiences in the last few days re taxi availability? I have never used Uber or Lyft so is it time to try it?\\nAlso I will be staying at the Affinia Shelburn. Will it be possible to score a taxi Sun around 5am for my return to LGA?\\nThanks. Getting a cab from LGA shouldn\\'t be a problem https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/by-taxi\\nYour planned departure time is around shift change for Yellow cabs so ask the doorman at your hotel if its typically difficult or consider booking a car service such as Dial 7, Carmel or Uber / Lyft\\nIF you use a car service from LGA you must meet them at the designated area adjacent to the terminal (Curbside airport pickups are not allowed. They can do curbside drop offs) https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides I would book a car service for your return.\\nDial7.com\\nCarmellino.com\\nThat way you don\\'t have to worry whether a taxi will be easy to find. I agree with booking a car service for the return trip. From my experience, yellow taxi cabs have been scarce in the city.\\nYou could also use the curb taxi app to book a yellow taxi for the return trip. I only recently started using it due the the scarce taxis in the city. Have not had an issue as yet.\\nEdited: 8:26 am, August 04, 2021 Thanks all! I booked a car service for my return. What about Uber? I was looking at car services, but, all the reviews lately lead me to believe the car services (especially Dial7) are dirty expensive and unreliable. Do I have it wrong? Duplicate post sorry\\nEdited: 12:45 pm, August 07, 2021 #6 - The app services are regulated as car services here\\nThere is enough demand from locals and business travelers that there are a number of reliable companies, including those mentioned above\\nThere have been recent reports of very high \"surge\" pricing by app services Uber is fine, but I wouldn\\'t rely on them for a trip to the airport last minute unless you have backup alternatives ready to go because you can\\'t predict the surge pricing. At least with a reputable car service you know well ahead of time Where is the nearest Wall art to the Dylan Hotel\\nin NewYirk. Need to buy a ready to go phone when I visit New York. Do you mean Walmart? Nearest Walmart is quite a trek - there are none on Manhattan. Are you willing to buy one elsewhere? There arent any Wal-Marts in NYC, the closest ones are in Secaucus, NJ and Valley Stream, LI (This one is very close to JFK Airport), Its right on the NYC line\\nThere are Targets all over the city Think they have prepaid phones in stores like best buy. Are you not able to bring your own phone and just swap out the sim card? That is what I do in pretty much every country I visit. Is there a best buy shop near the Dylan Hotel New York. Yes, at 531 Fifth Avenue. You can use Google Maps to find this very easily. Has anyone recently travel through JFK (From london preferably) ? If so how long did it take to get through from exiting the plane. I am a US citizen . Need to plan fir the next step. Thank you for any information you can give me. No one can predict how long it will take to get through the airport as there are so many that can affect timing. Are you trying to make a connection? If so, we would need to know if this connection is on one ticket & if you have to change terminals. I’m in the city now snd looking for a jewelry store that will have something my 16 yr old daughter might like. She is a bit of a skater as be a free spirit, likes colorful stones and dabbles in goth (skulls?). In the village maybe? I know there is nothing her speed in Midtown 😄 Lots of mainstream brands now have skull jewelry including Gucci. In silver sold at blooingdales.\\nThe east village will have what you want. Here\\'s a place called Stones and Bones\\nhttps://www.stonesandbonesnyc.com/products The Market in Soho might have some things and it\\'s a fun place to browse\\nhttp://www.themarketnyc.com/ My daughter loves Rock Star Crystals on 26th St.\\nEdited: 8:22 am, August 07, 2021 You might check out https://www.artistsandfleas.com/ for artisan and vintage. Two NY locations. Currently limited hours\\nAlso https://brooklynflea.com/ if here on a weekend. Multiple locations I checked Alex and Ani but looks like it’s a little to “pretty” for her. There are so many little stores on Soho and Nolita to East Village or Lower East Sidethat would have things for her. Hard to name just one store that is the magic bullet. But that’s the neighborhood I would be looking in Children under 12, who cannot be vaccinated, can show a negative test to attend. But the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall plan to bar them for now.\\nThe Broadway rules, which will be in place at least through October and apply to all 41 Broadway theaters, require that audiences wear masks, except when eating or drinking.\\nThe Broadway vaccination mandate will apply not only to audiences, but also to performers, backstage crew and theater staff. There will be limited exceptions: “people with a medical condition or closely held religious belief that prevents vaccination,” as well as children under 12, can attend with proof of a recent negative coronavirus test.\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/theater/broadway-audiences-vaccine-requirement.html?referringSource=articleShare Love these Broadway theaters! \" limited exceptions: “people with a medical condition or closely held religious belief that prevents vaccination,”\\nThat could render it about useless. I\\'m guessing but the people without said beliefs and conditions, real or otherwise, are the same people who\\'d be vaccinated and have no issues with a mask anyway. So with a giant loophole for anyone who doesn\\'t want to deal with it I\\'m not sure how much it changes things. I can\\'t imagine there being any sort of \\'proof\\' that could be checked for religious beliefs.\\nBut I suppose there\\'s probably not much of an overlap between the loophole grabbers and theatre goers.\\nEdited: 12:45 pm, July 30, 2021 #3 - My understanding is the \"loophole grabbers\" would have to present proof of a recent negative coronavirus test and wear masks which might not sit well with their feelings\\nAgree it\\'s an imperfect solution but it\\'s something\\nI\\'d expect some will indulge in sign waving and loud spittle spewing harassment of arriving audiences to make them feel better yeah testing requirements on the population in question would have a big positive impact for sure. I couldn\\'t read the whole article (pay wall) so missed that part. NY Times also reporting CDC has research indicating virus could be far worse than thought for the vaccinated and vaccinated may spread it more easily than thought. New analysis shows 74% of the nearly 900 infected (to date) in connection with July 4th celebrations in Provincetown were vaccinated.\\nAt this point think I\\'d just be more inclined to skip theater for a while.\\nEdited: 2:14 pm, July 30, 2021 Fun fact: 74% of the people in PTown that weekend were vaccinated.\\nWhich group was more affected by the virus? The vaccinated or the unvaccinated?\\nEdited: 2:27 pm, July 30, 2021 IMNSHO proof of vaccination should be required for all indoor gatherings. Our local summer chamber music festival luckily has an outdoor pavillian which they are using for their main concerts. Even so, they are requiring proof of vaccination, no admittance if not vaccinated & masks must be warn when not in the seating area. Happy for this, thanks for posting! I\\'ve been waiting for this announcement. I bought a few tickets for October with plans of getting refunds if they didn\\'t add a vaccination requirement. It would be nice if they didn\\'t have to have the exceptions but I know for legal reasons they do. Those few that meet the exceptions do need to have a negative test. It was the same rules for Springsteen and I felt pretty comfortable there (though they didn\\'t require masks for the vaccinated, I still wore one). Has anyone been on metro north recently? I need to head to new haven this week and it will probably be easier to take a train instead of renting a car and driving. With the current increase in covid cases I am wondering how crowded or uncrowded the train is in both directions and if social distancing is possible. I am also interested in hearing about any recent experiences on the New Haven line. I’m headed to Scarsdale on Thursday. Probably too late for you but I’m not worried. Was on the MN today and yesterday.....and probably every weekend for the last few months. I rode GC to Beacon and back.\\nGC is not as crowded as pre Covid, but it is pretty packed. Downstairs is opening up. Shake Shack is now open and that has drawn more people to eat down there.\\nI have absolutely zero issues riding the MN. There are announcements at the beginning and during the trip re masks.\\nI was on the train today when approaching 10 guys got on w/o masks. I believe they were military guys headed down to the city for a day out. The MN employee took their $ and then another MN employee came back and asked how many people didn\\'t have masks. She handed out masks for the duration of the ride.\\nThe MN is not packed during the wknd unless it is a Yankees game. Even then, there is still some room.\\nAbsolutely no issues riding the MN. The main thing that you should bring are headphones! A must if your trip is more than 1 stop. Thanks. Are those other lines comparable to the New Haven line though? I believe the New Haven line is one of the busiest if not busiest commuter rail line in the entire country. Pre-pandemic it wasn\\'t uncommon for trains to be standing room only during rush hour. I don\\'t expect the line to be that busy but if I am going to have people seated immediately next to me or within a few feet I\\'m not sure I am comfortable with that for a multi-hour ride. Yes, and there is a lot of reverse commuting on New Haven line. In my pre-pandemic experience it could be fairly crowded and raucous coming into the city at evening rush hour, esp out of places like Stamford and Greenwich , where many young people who live in the city work. I have not taken the train myself, but have family and friends that work at Metro North. With more people returning back to work the trains are becoming more crowded approaching and departing from NYC during rush hour peak times. Unfortunately not all cars open on most platforms, but conductors are quick to direct passengers to cars with more seating, and after the doors close there’s an announcement on the intercom that wearing masks is mandatory.\\nIf you’re flexible to travel off peak times you should be fine — if it was me I would walk to the furthest train and sit away from the doors in a three across next to the window with my personal belongings on the middle seat, I think ‘most’ people don’t want to sit immediately next to someone either. You could also wear a N95 or double mask if needed. Just got on to the 9:42 to Scarsdale (Harlem line).\\nGot to GC at 9:25ish, they didn’t announce the track until 9:36. It left from the lower level. As I descended the steps, the noxious aromas of rancid oil hit me - squelching any idea of any prepared foods whatsoever. I did notice that more dining is open but far from fully restored. Although the lines were short, I didn’t pick up coffee.\\nThe train is less than 1/4 full and everyone I can see is masked. Just got back from taking the metro north new haven line. About half the places on the lower level are open. Even though I went at an off-peak time the train was very crowded. I walked to the second to last car to find open rows of seats. Even in the cars furthest down there was someone in every row of seats. Usually it would be one person in the two person row and two people in the three person row, unless people were travelling together. There were also several people who rode the train standing by the doors. Mask use was ok but not 100%. Saw a few people not wearing masks properly or taking them on and off. Can\\'t imagine what it is like during rush hour. It wasn\\'t possible to socially distance on the trains I was on.\\nThe train back to NYC in the early evening was a little less crowded than the train I took early in the day (and certainly less crowded than the typical friday night train into the city) but it was full of younger people some of whom kept taking their masks off and kept going up and down the aisles. Lot of screaming and yelling. My favorite girl though was the one who kept removing her mask and walking up and down the aisle while she was frickin coughing the whole train ride. Saw several other passengers who felt they could just remove their mask as soon as they sat down and proceeded to talk loudly the whole train trip. Given how contagious the new variant is I will probably avoid the train in the future if the numbers in the region keep going up. #8 Your trip back into the city in early evening sounds a lot like last time I was on New Haven line, which was pre-pandemic. A lot of screaming, yelling and loud talking, plus drinking. @9 yes Friday early evenings tend to be like that. Was wondering if anyone had any experience with On Air parking in Times Square. Under $20 for over night. We are staying at the Marriott Marquis Time Square and need a place to park a rental car overnight due to Enterprise being closed on Sunday. Did you pm Brooke W? You\\'ve reopened a year old thread where she basically asked the same question. No experience with on air, but a note re: enterprise. I’m not sure which location you’re trying to drop off the rental car at, but I would double check (directly with the location) if they have after hours drop offs.\\n“My” enterprise is the UWS location (which is open on Sundays for what it’s worth), and they do NOT specify after hours drop offs online, but they actually do allow for it. Their office is located within a 24 hour garage and their staff can accept returned cars. They won’t get logged as “returned” until the following morning, but at least you don’t have to worry about parking it!\\nI’m not sure if the midtown locations work the same. I think the 11th Ave one is a stand alone building so may not have that luxury, although I think the west 53rd location is located within a parking garage so just might— at the very least, worth a direct call to ask! I never heard of on air before your post. Do any other out of towners want to share their first time to the city story while we are all counting down to our return visit?\\nMine is crazy (I think) and would love to share. I\\'ll put it in comments. Soooo,\\nMy first trip was the year 2000. I had a friend sign me up on AOL dating and pretty quickly this guy from NYC was messaging me, my friend thought he was cute so she pressured me to talk to him even though he lived thousands of miles away from us. We messaged/talked on the phone for a bit and next thing I knew I\\'m on a plane for a visit. I got a lot of flack from my friends/family about how crazy it was but I was just starting to realize my independence back then (and generally still being naive about the world). He lived in Queens, no idea what neighborhood, in a basement apt. I remember the subway being elevated because we had to climb up to get to it.\\nHe really did the tourist thing with me and I will always be so grateful for it. He took me to the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. Took me to see Miss Saigon on Broadway. He took me up on the ESB at night. He took me to THE OLIVE GARDEN for dinner guys!!! We drove to a beach (again, I have no idea which one, any guesses?), it wasn\\'t too far, maybe a hour in the car. We hung out in a neighborhood bar and watched sports. I was there for a long weekend and pretty quickly figured out we liked each other but not \"like that\". I left for home and never talked to him again. 9-11 happened and I messaged him hoping he was OK but I never heard anything back. I have a picture of me at Ellis Island with the twin towers in the background and I always look at that photo every year and think how much the world has changed since then and wonder what ever happened with JP. My first visit was when I was a child with my parents and it was a different New York.\\nThen 7 years ago I went with my son for a short weekend. I will always remember that on our very first day, while waiting for the hotel room to be ready, I stood in front of Bethesda fountain and fell in love with New York City at that very moment. My favorite part of that trip was letting my son sleep in the morning so I could just walk around alone.\\nWhich brings me to my first solo trip 6 years ago, I went all out. Got myself a room at the Waldorf Astoria, went to Oceana for dinner between the ballet and a play. Oceana is where I had my first taste of imperial. Had the most expensive breakfast of my life delivered to the room on the Sunday morning.\\nBeing alone in New York, able to walk where I wanted at any time of the day, just made me fall in love with New York even more.\\nI have since visited many times and will be back in on August 19 for what I believe will be my 10th visit. I\\'m so sad I didn\\'t take notes nor wrote a trip report for my first trip. Would have come in handy sometimes to look back on. But. The one thing I\\'m always reminded of when I return is that feeling when exiting Penn Station for the first time after having taken the NJ transit from Newark and being \\'hit\\' with the sounds, smells and overall first intense impressions that are typical of this area. I only have a quick one from when I was a teenager. Visited for a school theater trip. A blizzard came. It was magical! and we got to stay another day in NYC so that\\'s a win! Saw the Fantasticks, which was a blast. The Olympics were on and we enjoyed watching that with some wine coolers that someone managed to secure from somewhere. I had been convinced that snow wouldn\\'t stick much in NYC because of so much running under ground. I was very wrong. :) My earliest trips to NYC were with the boy scouts in the 1950s when we would visit the AMNH. As we approached the city on the chartered bus, one would encounter dense haziness that I now realize was smog. The city always seemed rather gray. Outside of the museum, I was astonished to see rocky outcroppings in Central Park---something we did not have in Bucks County, PA. A treat was the man selling roasted chestnuts from a cart. This involved a metal bucket of charcoal with a pan that held the nuts, each dutifully slit so they would not explode in the heat. Peeling them was a chore, but the reward was worth it. Sadly, the chestnut men in NYC and the soft pretzel carts in Philly have all disappeared. My first trip was in 2015, over Labor Day weekend, with one of my best friends. I remember the first thing we did after dropping our bags at the hotel was walk to Times Square and we just sat on the red steps for a while, just taking in all the sights and sounds. I remember thinking \"I cant believe I\\'m finally here!\" We did all the touristy things (including getting lost in Central Park), had one of the best meals of my life at Beauty & Essex, and we left 4 days later, with me (both of us, really) already planning my next trip. That year for Christmas, my friend gave me a photo book of our trip-first gift that had ever made me cry!\\nI\\'ve been back 3 other times since then, and I\\'ll be back in a couple of weeks for my first solo trip. I cant wait to be \"alone\" in the city! #smallfishinaverybigpond I\\'ve been in the city with friends and alone and while there were times that I wished I was with someone I definitely love solo traveling to the city. #6 you will love having the say in everything that you do. The biggest memory from my very first trip is actually the flight into JFK.\\nI had been poring over NYC maps for months and as the plane flew from the west coast directly off Lower Manhattan towards JFK I was looking and looking and looking to see if I could recognise anything from my window seat. I spotted a huge green rectangle and it dawned on me it was Central Park! And from that I could work out where other sights were, such as Brooklyn Bridge (spotting that was an aha ! moment too) and the ESB etc. It was a big goose bump moment. I felt I was looking at a map of NYC from the plane. Memories which leap out from my first trip:\\n•Arriving on the train from Boston in the early afternoon, just watching the city approach. I\\'ve been back a bunch since, but no plane landing has ever matched that first train ride.\\n•Meeting up with someone from the Internet at a dive bar, where we hung out til midnight. Then we wandered around the East Village for a couple of hours chatting, before ducking in backstage at the little theatre she worked in, to use the facilities and have some privacy.\\n•Going to some cocktail bar 50+ floors up, just easy of Broadway, and the sheer dizzying atmosphere looking down on the night time city below.\\nI\\'ve been back half a dozen times since, and it will never get old. What is best airline and best New York airport to get to\\nPuerto Rico ? It will depend on your definition of “best” (are you looking for lowest fares, convenient schedules, most leg room, etc.) and when you plan to travel - some airlines have daily flights others fly less often or only during certain “high season months.\\nAs for which NYC area airport, choose the one that is most convenient in terms of location to your home. Check out these airlines, all of which fly from NYC airports to SJU: Sprint, Delta , Frontier, United, Jet Blue and Westjet. Your profile says you’re in CA…so if you’re flying through NYC the best will be dependent on what one you’re flying to. Or if you’re building in a few days in NYC around the trip, where you’re staying and/or what you’re willing to do in terms of travel. It looks like options for nonstop flights are United, Delta or Jet Blue and airport options JFK or Newark (EWR). If you\\'re starting from Manhattan, it doesn’t really matter which airport.. you have less chance of delays the earlier in the day you leave. If the first two replies seem crazy it’s because this post started off in the St. Barth forum…. Crazy? What\\'s crazy about them? Hi, I was suggested in another thread that 4 observation decks would be an overkill in a 5 days trip. I have 8 yr old twin boys and they are obsessed with the tall building and SOL and what not.\\nWe can\\'t skip Empire state, SOL, Brooklyn Bridge.\\nCan you please suggest if I should skip one or two from the below list:\\nOne world observatory, Rockerfeller center , Top of the rock , Edge -observation deck. Tof of the Rock is in the Rockefeller Center, just FYI. Couldn\\'t figure out if you knew this or not from your post so if you already knew this, sorry. It\\'s my favorite observatory. You get great views of Empire State Building from it. Haven\\'t been to the Edge. One World Observatory has a cool elevator ride.\\nEdited: 11:14 am, August 05, 2021 Rockefeller Center and Top of the Rock are the same. We just did One WTC—it’s cool because it is the highest in the hemisphere. The Edge looked awesome from afar. We’ll probably do that one next time. Can\\'t decide for you, but factors to consider\\nOWO has a picture postcard view of the midtown skyline and you\\'ll be nearby for the SOL & BB. All indoors\\nTOTR has nice daylight views of the features Central Park (sort of a black rectangle after dark) and indoor and outdoor areas\\nHaven\\'t been to the Edge but imagine the glass floor feature is pretty thrilling\\nWhatever you decide I\\'d do both full daylight and late afternoon through sunset to see the city light up (and some are open pretty long hours if you have the stamina)\\nWouldn\\'t book too far in advance so you can monitor weather / visibility\\nAgree 4 is too many for most visitors but might not be for your enthusiasts Depends on what you want to see. What view would appeal most? I have only done TOTR because I love it. It has a bunch of different decks and indoor spaces. I love the view of CP and the other tall buildings. My phone\\'s background is a great pic of the ESB all lit up at twilight.\\nThe Edge looks really cool. I\\'ve done TOTR and loved the views of the Empire State Building, but just did The Edge in June. I\\'m sure your 8 year old would love the terrifying views from the point and the glass floor (again. Terrifying! LOL). Sorry yes i know Rockerfeller and TOTR are the same. So, we should do OWO, Edge from what I hear. My husband has kinda fear of heights and I am no braveheart so I guess we all 4 will be terrified at Edge LOL.\\nI Can\\'t decide between ESB and TOTR since TOTR has ESB view but ESB is just iconic :)\\nWould you suggest any one particular during night time ? We always go a bit before sundown so we can see things in the daylight and then see the lights start to turn on. It\\'s pretty magical. :) Like I said, I like seeing ESB. I don\\'t really need to be in it. But, I would show your kids youtube videos or something of each and let them pick. Or just pull out of a hat!\\nEdited: 11:45 am, August 05, 2021 Do your boys have a general enthusiasm for skyscrapers or any preconceived ideas/preferences about any of the observatories? (Will they be bummed out if they don\\'t go to one they already know about?)\\nThe ESB has spectacular nighttime views and is open late (daytime is pretty great too)\\nDo TOTR in daylight or afternoon through sunset for the reasons mentioned above.\\nOWO timing might depend on the rest of your plans downtown Kaye she,s already said the kids are obsessed with tall buildings. This might be a case of do them all. I haven\\'t been to ESB since they renovated but people say the experience of going up is more fun. Before the renovation I would have said definitely Top of the Rock vs ESB but now, maybe both is a good idea. ESB is good at night, as Kaye said. You don\\'t list where you live, but if you’re not likely to come back any time soon, do as many as you can fit in and afford. NIf you will come back, maybe pick 2-3 and save the rest for next time.\\nEdited: 12:03 pm, August 05, 2021 Sorry you do list your home town. Would anyone have a suggestion by any chance? Thanks! There was a recent discussion about the Arlo NoMad and the Moxy East Village, that might highlight some positives or negatives about which one to choose.\\nThe Moxy Chelsea is in a different neighbourhood than the Moxy East Village in the discussion, but there are relevant points made.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13534212-Hotels_help_me_pick-New_York_City_New_York.html Thank you for the reply and link! The discussion is around the area, which I have already considered before ending up having to chose between the Arlo NoMad or the Moxy Chelsea. They are both conveniently located for me, and I found them at similar prices, but i am not sure which one to chose. The Arlo NoMad has better reviews but everyone says the rooms are very tiny. The Moxy Chelsea has mixed reviews. The price for the view is too high in both hotels, so I will go with their basic room. Not easy to chose though! Both hotels have really small rooms.\\nOyster.com\\nhas pictures of the Arlo NoMad rooms. They son\\'t have that Moxy but they do have the Moxy Times Square and I imagine rooms are similar. I prefer the location of the Moxy Chelsea. Wanted to share our experiences of visiting NYC over Memorial Day weekend. These forums have been such an incredible resource and I wanted to say thank you to all the posters who offer feedback and suggestions! It\\'s very much appreciated!\\nA little background... I travelled with my 2 teenage daughters. We live in Buffalo, NY so we were used to the NYS Covid protocols, and in choosing NYC as a travel destination, we wanted to accomplish 2 things, travel safely (we are fully vaccinated) and keep tourism money in NY since we know our state has been very hard hit by the pandemic. I hadn\\'t been to NYC since 2000, my 19 year old had never been, and my 17 year old went for 1 1/2 days a few years ago with a friend.\\nI chose our hotel based on location, bedding configuration, safety, and access to the subway lines. We stayed at The Artezen Hotel in Fidi. I cannot say enough about this hotel! Super clean and updated, amazing location, and helpful staff. We would leave the hotel early in the morning, and come back late at night (after 11pm) and felt safe taking the subway back and walking back to our hotel.\\nI know there have been concerns with safety and random attacks around NYC in general, and on the subway as well. I did a solo trip in the late 90\\'s and took the subways all over, so I didn\\'t really have any trepidation taking them now with my daughters. We travelled on many different lines all weekend and didn\\'t have any problems. There were a few encounters with a few \"overzealous entertainers\" but if you ignored them and didn\\'t engage they left you alone. Honestly, wearing a mask help because I was able to hide my facial expressions! Obviously using common sense is essential. don\\'t flash your valuables, know where you\\'re going, avoid the empty cars, etc.\\nI\\'ll break this up into a few parts. Thanks! I’m excited to read the rest of your report! 5/27-5/28\\nWe arrived at Penn Station via Amtrak Thursday afternoon. We had rolling luggae and we navigated ourselves to the subway line so we could take the subway to our hotel. After researching how often we\\'d take the subway, I decided to just buy the 7 day unlimited passes for each of us to simplify things. After purchasing our passes at the kiosk, we took the subway and then checked in at our hotel. After settling in, we grabbed a quick dinner at Shake Shack at Fulton Center and then took the subway uptown to Rockafeller Center to visit Top of the Rock. Since we arrived around 7pm, we had to pay the extra $10 sunset surcharge. There was no line to purchase tickets, and it took us only a few minutes to get through security and then go through the photo line. We waited less than 5 minutes for the elevator up, and then spent the rest of the evening enjoying the incredible views from the top! Honestly, the extra $10 for the sunset view was totally worth it! It wasn\\'t crowded, and we got many amazing pictures from a variety of vantage points. We enjoyed the daylight views, watching the sunset, and then seeing the city all lit up at night. So glad we chose to go there at this time because it was the nicest weather of the weekend. They closed promptly at 9pm and we were ushered out. We then walked around Rockefeller Center (there\\'s construction going on) and then viewed Radio City Music Hall and found a place for some ice cream, then took the subway back to our hotel around 10:30pm\\nFriday morning we had 9am tickets for the Statue of Liberty Ferry, so we walked from our hotel to Castle Clinton, making a quick pit stop at Leo\\'s Bagels. We had prepurchased tickets but I will tell you, the line to purchase tickets was super short. It was a quick 10 minute process to go through security, and we made it on the first ferry. They were limiting it to 1/2 capacity, so 600 people max per ferry. When we arrived on Liberty Island it was surreal to be walking alone to the statue! We spent about an hour taking pictures and then took the ferry to Ellis Island. where again, there were barely any people. We had some entire exhibit rooms to ourselves! I took pictures of a completely empty Great Hall! After leaving Ellis Island, we walked around Battery Park, rode the Seaglass Carousel, and then walked up through Wall Street to see the Charging Bull Statue, Fearless Girl, and The NYSE. After a delicious lunch at Mad Dog and Beans on Stone Street, and then a quick stop at Insomnia Cookies, we headed back to our hotel to freshen up, grab out jackets and umbrellas, because the weather was about to take a turn for the worse.\\nAfter freshening up at our hotel, we walked over to the 9/11 Memorial, and by then, it started to drizzle. Upon entering the Plaza, it started to pour. I don\\'t know if it was the rain or lack of crowds, but we were one of a handful of people viewing the Memorial. It was honestly surreal, to be there by ourselves. When we walked to the South pool. we were the only ones around it. We then headed into the Occulus where we broswed a bit (teens loves shopping) and then took the subway up to the Strand BookStore. After that, we headed up to Times Square and popped into a few stores. Again, since it was pouring, it kept the crowds low. The usual sidewalk hustlers and characters weren\\'t there, and we got some really great pictures, After having dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe (teens request) we walked around Times Square some more, took more pics, checked out the schlocky gift shops, and then called it a night. It’s SO nice to be reading trip reports again! 😊 Thank you so much for taking the time to write and I’m looking forward to hearing more! I saw this and thought the same thing! So nice to be reading trip reports! Can\\'t wait to write my own! Awesome trip. Thanks for your trip report. Enjoying this immensely…just wish you’d had better weather for your visit. I remember how cold and rainy it was that weekend! Enjoyed the report. Is there more? I\\'m eager to hear more! Heading to NYC in Oct with my teen daughters (their first visit). I have an idea of what they should see for the first time, but your thoughts and more recent insight are so helpful. Thanks everyone! I\\'m glad that people are finding this enjoyable! It\\'s fun to relive the trip through writing this! (And the zillion pictures I took!)\\nLindaE: Yes, the only con to the whole weekend was the weather, The persistent hard rain was not enjoyable and schlepping wet umbrellas all over was inconvenient. However, I do believe that the weather helped crowdwise in some instances.. Has anyone used www.onairparking.com to park near Penn Station in NYC. We are staying in a Airbnb near Penn Station. Using On Air Parking is showing much cheaper prices than anywhere else I\\'ve seen. I want to make sure it is legit and customers are satisfied before I book. Thanks! Be prepared to get advice that you aren\\'t asking about. In other words the legality of a short term rental in NYC. The host will be present and there are only two guests. Thanks! :) Never used (or heard) of onairparking. I typically use www,spothero.com to prebook discounted parking in NYC (and other major cities). \"Near Penn Station\" nobody really lives. If this AirBNB even exists, its not so close to Penn Station ***The host will be present and there are only two guests. Thanks! :)***\\nSerious question, if the host is present, does that mean you\\'re renting a room? If so, is a lock required on the bedroom door or not? It seems unlikely to me. $14.99 per day \"near Penn Station\" is not realistic. Here\\'s a quote from the site:\\nOnce you purchase parking from us, you\\'ll be e-mailed full details of the parking facility in terms of the address, name, phone number, etc. While we can\\'t tell you that now, we can say that this location is a short walk away from Penn Station, it is a professional parking facility and is staffed 24/7. Please note: There is no in and out access with this reservation. Free Cancellations.\\nIs there any chance this is one of those global valet services, and the car will actually be parked somewhere else? If it seems too good to be true, then it probably isn\\'t.\\nWhat are the \"fees\" in addition to the $14.99 quote? Interesting details obsoperator. Yes, that\\'s way less than SpotHero but with spothero your booking is for a particular garage and the full price is known upfront. If you use it, please report back. You may have uncovered a new parking disrupter.\\nIf you can cancel without penalty it might be worth trying. I booked it! We aren\\'t traveling until November, if this thread is still open I will report back! Just because the host will be present does not mean that the rental is legal. The host may be breaking their lease or owner\\'s agreement by renting to you without permission from the landlord or board.\\nYour safest bet is to get a hotel.\\nYou don\\'t want something like this to happen to you:\\nhttps://nypost.com/2016/11/27/airbnb-horror-story-should-scare-you-out-of-renting-in-nyc/\\nIf other people in the building have discovered that your host is renting illegally they may report them before you arrive. Then you may end up having nowhere to stay. There are instances of landlords initiating eviction proceedings against hosts doing this. This is a long-overdue trip report (that is LONG) from a mother/daughters/sister trip. We were so excited to finally be returning to the city we love! It was myself, my sister, and my 2 teen daughters. My daughters and I have been there multiple times, so we have seen most of the main “tourist” spots. We wanted to just be in the city, walk, and explore. Although I tried to stick to an agenda/route, we did end up doing a lot of zig-zagging (which we were totally fine with, and made the MetroPass worth it!).\\nFirst, we arrived on a Sunday morning to LaGuardia. Call me crazy, but I prefer Lyft/Uber to taxis. I think seeing the meter rise gives me anxiety vs. a set rate. Lyft was less expensive and only a 5 minute wait, so we made our way to the meeting area. The pick-up area for rides (which was new to me!) was very efficient! We actually had to hustle a bit to get there, but once there it is SO much easier to find your car! A short ride with a friendly chatty driver and we soon reached our hotel.\\nHOTEL: We had a room at the Moxy East Village. My daughters immediately fell in love with the vibe of this hotel! We had a quad room, with 2 bunks. My sister and I each took a lower, and the teens the uppers. Loved the separate charging stations and not having to share a bed. There is not a ton of storage, but we made it work. There have been comments on the bathrooms being tiny and not very private. We were fine, though! It worked for us that my daughters prefer to shower at night and sleep in, so my sister and I would get up first to shower in the morning (and as a side note - the shower was POWERFUL! My daughter said she felt like she was reborn! LOL). I wouldn’t stay here with someone I didn’t know, but otherwise, totally recommend!\\nSUNDAY: Our room wasn’t ready, so we left our luggage and went in search of food. I was surprised that a lot of places were not open yet (brunch in WI usually starts by 9, and it was after 10). We decided to walk around to get a feel for the East Village...so different from where we’ve stayed before! Loved it! We ended up back near the hotel, and with my youngest becoming a bit hangry, decided to eat right next to the hotel at The Ainsworth (which was also funny as my daughter’s name is Ainsley…). It was good food, cute outdoor space. I don’t remember what I had, but it was fine. Our room was ready so we went to check in. After dropping of luggage, we decided to head to the Chelsea Flea Market. On our way, we meandered around FIT, my daughter’s dream school. Loved the area! Ended up at the L.E.A.F. flower show in the Meatpacking District. So fun! We headed back to the room for a short break before deciding on dinner. My girls really wanted Keste - it is their favorite and the place that made us all fall in love with Neopolitan pizza! So sad that the Greenwich Village location closed, but we decided to go to the only one open in the Financial District (?). We were able to sit outside, had a lovely waiter, an Italian family sitting next to us, and delicious pizzas! It was a great end to the day! (And my sister got to ride the subway for the first time...one of her 2 requests for the trip!)\\nMONDAY: We started our day with bagels from Bagel Belly. Next time, I will just hop into one of the markets. They were fine, the decor was cute, but the bagels were pricier than I was used to (though that may be because my daughters ordered the Pride Rainbow bagels…). Then it was off to Central Park! We strolled/roamed for hours! It was a bit drizzly, but it made for amazing pictures and a very empty feeling park. Very different than what I’ve experienced before! Found some new paths and beautiful arches! After walking miles, we finally left and headed to Times Square. Love all the lights, and it was busy! We usually spend about 20 minutes there, and consider it good. Particularly exciting was walking around the Broadway theaters and seeing them advertise that they were opening!!!! We had lunch at Junior’s (something touristy we had not done yet) and sat outside. It was interesting to watch the street as they were setting up for filming a movie. The food was good, but nothing special. That evening we had tickets for The Edge. The subway station to get off there terrified me. I don’t like heights and had to close my eyes! Loved getting some pics with King Kong, and seeing the Vessel. Unfortunately, as we were about to check in, a storm moved in and they closed the observatory deck. Lots of crabby people waiting in line to reschedule, but a very kind employee gave me a card and said we could just call in the morning. So we headed back to the hotel, grabbing some snacks from the market on our way back.\\nTUESDAY: SO many steps this day! We all wanted to walk the Brooklyn Bridge, so we set out early on the subway. Getting there early was ideal, as the famous Instagram spot with the Empire State Building was still pretty empty. Last time I was there it was PACKED. This, of course, made the teens ecstatic! We walked all around Dumbo and part of the Promenade, before heading back across the Brooklyn Bridge. From there wandered to the Village, and had a yummy meal outdoors, but I cannot remember where! We then moved on to SoHo, and did some shopping there and all the way back to the hotel!. A quick change and rest before making our way to Chelsea Piers. We booked a sunset sail through Sail-NYC. It was amazing! The wind had picked up as we were walking to the dock, and once the engines were off...gorgeous! The crew was very polite and efficient with drink service, and made sure everyone got a group picture with the Statue of Liberty in the background! I would definitely recommend this! It was a new way to see the city. We thought about grabbing food from within the Chelsea Market, but most restaurants, by the time we got there seemed to be closing. We ended up grabbing a pizza to take back to the room from Joe’s Pizza, near the hotel.\\nWEDNESDAY: This was our final day, and we covered a lot of zigzagging ground! We had rebooked The Edge for this morning, so started there. It was a clear, crisp morning, and the views were gorgeous! Our original time slot had been for sunset, but it actually worked out better this way - there were not a lot of people there, and just a very short line for the “Instagram” spot. An employee was telling me how crowded it is in the evening, so we enjoyed the space and time to wander. And that point...if you have a fear of heights (me) and open views (also me), it was challenging to stand on! My daughter had to help me back into the corner! After that, we went to Rockefeller Center area, and decided to get our favorite Banana Pudding from Magnolia! My oldest REALLY wanted to go to the flagship Marc Jacobs store, so that was our next stop. She LOVED it, and the employees were very friendly, and thanked us for returning to the city, which was cool. We made our way back to the East Village, and went to all of the interesting thrift/vintage stores, before finally heading back to LGA.\\nI know I am forgetting some details, but it was so amazing to be back in my favorite city! A personal win, for the first time ever I did not get lost or turned around once using the subway! LOL! I knew to pay attention to where you enter/exit, now understand uptown/downtown...it felt great to not be confused!!\\nI can’t wait to return with my husband in October! We have 3 Broadway shows booked, hoping to officially tour FIT and other schools, and I pray that that trip can happen. I am sure I will be back with some questions before then! What a great trip! And don’t you love that you have different experiences when you’re with different people? I bet you have a very different story to tell when you return w your husband. So glad you shared your experience in your TR! Sounds like a fun, great trip. I\\'m happy to hear you enjoyed East Village as a base, and the feedback on the hotel. I absolutely love that area. Sounds fabulous! Hope your sister enjoyed herself. I\\'m impressed you walked the Brooklyn Bridge with a fear of heights. It wasn\\'t that long! I enjoyed it and thank you for sharing! I\\'m flying into LGA and renting a car from Budget. It sounds like a huge pain and long distance to get from Terminal B (Southwest Airlines) to the rental facility. Has anyone just gotten an Uber or Taxi to take you to the rental car place? They\\'re supposed to have a shuttle bus from the terminal https://www.budget.com/en/locations/us/ny/east-elmhurst/lga\\nI doubt if it\\'s faster or more convenient but I suppose you could get a Yellow cab from the dispatcher line outside the terminal https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/by-taxi\\nFor a car service, including the app services, you must meet them at the designated area adjacent to the terminal https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides The announcement will likely be made today the NY Times reports:\\nmadehttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/nyregion/nyc-vaccine-mandate.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20210803&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=cta&regi_id=51574278&segment_id=65215&user_id=711df6e1327df9d73b5926566797a644 Being made now. Bravo have they thought about how to handle situation of families with younger kids and so on? I don\\'t understand why they are phasing this in. The virus isn\\'t going to wait. #2 - For now outdoor dining is still an option. Once winter comes hopefully things will have changed for the better (lower transmission / infection rates and perhaps vaccine authorization for kids under 12) Hello, vaccinated Canadian here. Thinking of visiting NYC next month.\\nAny word on what visitors from outside of the country can do to provide proof of vaccination? Have Canadian documentation obviously, but will that be sufficient? This is great news. May it spread across the country. Is it going to be acceptable to have a combo (Pfizer, Astra Zenaca?) has many Canadians do as we were told it was fine to mix them.\\nSome cruise ships are denying Canadians due to the mixed vaccines. From what I can tell full details of the plan have not yet been released - but will hopefully be clarified for out of state travelers reasonably soon\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/nyregion/nyc-vaccine-mandate.html \"I don\\'t understand why they are phasing this in. The virus isn\\'t going to wait.\" Because businesses need time to implement policies and get the details of how to verify status. Also, it is obvious that the city is hoping by doing this people will run out to get vaccinated, so they want to give those people time to do so. I read something about an NY Excelsior Pass. I do have proof of my 2 Pfizer vaccines with QR codes in my phone, however, I tried to download the app on my iPhone and cannot even find the app. Is this new and is it possible I will be able to install it before I get to New York in a few weeks? The planes are 8-passenger propeller planes, very fast trip, but not cheap:\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/boston-new-york-seaplane-review-tailwind-first-flight/?utm_source=TPG%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2681192&utm_usr=9e594564580372016592cac97c9beb137cdcdbf814ce05cfdb43095b9c0df7f1&utm_msg=a1c516449fcc48bd86fee7deaf3e82f6&utm_date=2021-08-04 $800 round trip(min)? Nope.\\nI would rather take the train/fly commercial. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13625587-Manhattan_to_Boston_via_Seaplane-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nAlso compared to what the cost of a shuttle flight, cab from midtown to LGA and cab from BOS to downtown, the cost isn\\'t that different. As someone who does the LGA/BOS shuttle regularly, makes all the sense in the world especially since the Delta shuttle moved from the marine air terminal. I used to arrive 1/2 before the scheduled departure. Can\\'t do that anymore. The time savings alone is worth a couple hundred. This isn\\'t for your typical leisure traveler. I do round trip to DC for a meeting in one day with some regularity - if there was this kind of option, and I could get it partially subsidized and just pay the rest...I would do it. I have a meeting in DC in a few weeks with an obligatory dinner after. I\\'ll be on the 10PM train back to Manhattan. That totally sucks...wish a quick and easy flight was an option. Even if I had to subsidize half. Bummer. Just checked the schedule and there are only 2 flights a day in either direction. Last flight from Boston leaves at 5:35. Any time I have a client dinner in Boston, I have to stay the night as the last shuttle leaves at 6:30 and then take the 6:00 am shuttle back. If these guys did a flight at 9, it would be filled. Would save my firm to have me fly home that night instead of paying for a hotel room. They will be adding lots more flights assuming this does well.\\nAnd it will do well I happened to step out on my terrace around 6.30 -7 last night, heard some plane buzz, saw a seaplane coming from north headed for \"landing,\" and assume splashdown occurred just south of UN, near 42d St, though was out of my view. Have no idea where that plane came from. Can\\'t say I\\'d be particularly interested in trying it, certainly not in the dark.\\nThat points guy said they weighed baggage, but didn\\'t say they weighed passengers, so airline employees must be pretty confident in own guesswork. My experience flying helicopters and tiny planes like Cessnas is that weight is crucial and there is procedure for getting people on scale, though agents are very accurate at estimating, thereby helping save face for passengers sensitive about being weighed in public. Re #4 My recollection is that, in normal times, last shuttles leave later than 6.30 on weeknights -- more like 9.30. I can only assume this situation will change once \"things are back to normal.\" How late is the other shuttle leaving, or do you have to take Delta? #7 - I wish there was a 9:30, but I don\\'t recall a flight that late. My firm doesn\\'t restrict which airline we fly. Cost comes out of my P&L. The schedule currently shows the last shuttle at 7:20. Even when I\\'m not staying for dinner, I\\'ve had meetings and then gone out for drinks at 5 and have had to keep an eye on the time and bolt out at 6 or so to make sure I catch the last shuttle flight back. I once missed it and had to check into a hotel with no bags. No fun. If I could just stroll down to the harbor 1/2 hour before the flight time and take off, that would be like a dream. Would give me time to have dinner and then make it back home the same day. My day trip to Boston is essentially like a long day with a hellish commute on either end. This flight option would make it better. The driver I usually use who has a Cadillac Escalade is unavailable I was wondering if anyone has a driver or contact information for someone with an Escalade that has the room for 7+ luggage. I know there are services that I can call but I was just curious if anybody had a individual driver they use for their family when they’re going to the airport. Thanks in advance! Our family uses Trans Star Executive. They have always done right by us. Two years ago, we had a Sprinter van for 9 plus luggage. I’ve been reading the NYC subways are less busy and less safe during Covid.\\nAre people starting to take the trains again?\\nHow safe are the subways in the Upper East Side? I twice took the subway to Penn Station around 6 am on a Sat. morning and it was fairly crowded with many standing by the time we reached Manhattan. This was unexpected given the day of the week. The subway is less busy during COVID, but that does not mean that it isn\\'t busy. This is NYC. Less busy to many would seem very busy to people who don\\'t use it regularly.\\nPeople are taking the trains again. I ride them daily.\\nThe subway system is safe. Not as busy but still busy with people on it. Have been on the subways several times this week including the UES. Trains are not packed solid with people but they are crowded enough that there is no social distancing and sometimes there are no seats available at the busiest time. Have not had any issue with safety on the trains beyond the crowding and have been taking them for several months.\\nEdited: 11:40 am, August 04, 2021 Thank you -\\nI’m a concerned mom whose child will be utilizing the subway.\\nNews stories on “abc7ny.com” are frightening! Appr 2 million+ people/day ride the subway. That\\'s down approximately 50%. A few incidents that get reported should not overshadow how safe, efficient and inexpensive the system is. I wouldn\\'t be worried at all. It is really almost always the best way to get around. I wouldn;t let an occasional bad story keep me from riding. How many people per day ride without incident? Many! Really not a worry. My 16yo and I use the subway or walk everywhere. I rode the subway to and from school as a kid without incident. That was at a time when NYC was far less safe than it is now.\\nThe news often targets NYC. It just makes for ratings. Then there is the \"news\" with a particular slant. NYC bashing is nothing new for them.\\nEdited: 3:40 pm, August 04, 2021 Is this concert free? How can one get tickets?

I’ll be visiting that weekend so I got tix on Monday. There are both free and VIP tix starting at $399. I opted for the VIP so didn’t have issues but if you are trying for the free ones I’d recommend going to the site well before 9pm as you will be added to the wait room and have a spot in line. Let us see what the Covid situation is on the 21st. Things are getting worse, not better, and there is a very serious gamma variant that has emerged in Peru and will likely get here as all else does. In today\\'s NY Times, they stated that there was a tremendous run on these tickets & you could very well get shut out if you opt for the free tickets. It reminded me of when the Covid vaccine was released & trying to get an appointment for a shot left many in tears with frustration. FYI, the concert will be broadcast live on CNN. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

In my opinion, there really is no reason to travel several neighborhoods over for breakfast when many areas have solid places to eat.\\n**What are the musts and also hidden gems?**\\nAre you talking restaurants/places to eat or things to do? French bistro type places that I like: Frenchette, Balthazar, Pastis\\nPizza: Marta for a sit down meal. Or Keste in Financial District. Otherwise, there are plenty of grab and go type places all over the place.\\nAre you looking for other kinds of Italian restaurants as well? It\\'s sort of unclear in your post. I like Babbo, Bar Pitti, Monte\\'s Trattoria, Maialino, Felice (on Gold street), Gnocco and a bunch of others.\\nVeselka has breakfast type items all day if I recall correctly and is an institution in a very interesting area.\\nEdited: 12:31 pm, August 04, 2021 Pizza - slices from Joe\\'s on Carmine St. Sit down at Don Antonio. Saigon Shack in the west village. John\\'s pizza near there too. You were asked for your budget in the other thread you started.\\nNot sure by \"hidden gems\" if you are only looking for food recs or for other recommendations, too.\\nSpecific questions get the best answers Hi! I am leaving tomorrow, Thursday from hotel on 47th, b/w 7th and 8th Ave. close to Times Square to La Guardia. 5 people, 4 carry on. My flight is a 7:45 PM. I\\'d like to be at the airport between 5:30-5:45. What time should I leave for the airport? How is the traffic at this time? And, what\\'s the best option?The Ubers are more expensive than normal which could be due to covid and the amount of passengers. Thanks so much! Be safe Try Dial 7 car service or Carmel limo\\nDial7.com\\nCarmellimo.com\\nand get a price and ask them when to leave.\\nThe high price from Uber is because you’re going in rush hour. If you can carry the bags easily, taking the subway to the bus will likely be faster at that hour. That would be 40-60 mins. By car it will take 1-1 1/2 hrs. Subway to 74 St - Broadway/Roosevelt Av - Jackson Heights then laguardia link is by far your best bet. You\\'re traveling at what\\'s practically peak rush hour and traffic has already had a significant rebound. The 7, R, E, F, and M lines all pass near times Square and stop there, so whichever one stops closest to your hotel works. The E line and 7 Express lines will probably be slightly faster, since they run express through woodside. If you take the 7 express line, make sure to get off at 61st woodside instead, since it skips that other stop, you catch the same bus from there. I\\'ve taken the LaGuardia Link (Q70 bus). It is very quick being a limited stop bus. It will be about a 20/25 minute ride that time of day from 61st St. This hotel on W Broadway and Chambers has reopened. Under new managment, and a return to its former name - Smyth.\\nhttps://www.smythtribeca.com/\\nI\\'m glad, because the location is excellent and the area has lost one if its other really nice small boutique hotels during the pandemic (Duane street hotel which was one of my favorites in the area). I only have a very vague memory of some sort of show with Lamb Chop on it, maybe I was too young or maybe it wasn\\'t a hit show here in Australia.\\nBut, Lamb Chop is a born and bred New Yorker like many other famous puppets. Nowadays she works with Shari\\'s daughter, Mallory.\\nBeginning today, she\\'ll make her way across Manhattan to The Clemente (107 Suffolk St.) on the Lower East Side where the International Puppet Fringe Festival is taking place, the Top of the Rock (30 Rockefeller Center), Central Park, Times Square and Governors Island Ferry.\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/follow-lamb-chop-as-she-tours-iconic-manhattan-sites-for-puppet-week-080221\\nThen she\\'ll be on show at the City of New York from August 13th 2021.\\nPuppets from Punch and Judy to Oscar the Grouch; from Lamb Chop to The Lion King; from Lunar New Year to the Thanksgiving Day parade, the marionettes, shadow figures, and rod and hand puppets, all will be at the museum exhibit.\\nJim Henson and Julie Taymor, Basil Twist and Theodora Skipitares, Ralph Lee and Pura Belpré, Great Small Works and Teatro SEA are just some the influential puppeteers featured in Puppets of New York, an exhibition poised to bring joy and awe, live performances and panels, workshops and movies to people of all ages.\\nhttps://www.mcny.org/exhibition/puppets-new-york\\nGo for adult nostalgia or take the kids to show them what past kid\\'s had for fun in generations gone by.\\nLamb Chop and others will also appear in the Puppet Fringe Festival running from August 11th to 15th. This features many different puppet and marionette themes and characters from across the globe.\\nhttp://puppetfringenyc.com/performers/\\nThis could be fun for visitors and locals with kids of all ages. According to Wikipedia she started on Captain Kangaroo which would explain why I remember her. My greatest fear when we moved from New Jersey to Illinois when I was six years old was that I would not be able to see the Captain every morning. I loved Captain Kangaroo and was so happy to find him again in suburban Chicago. I don\\'t recall Captain Kangaroo at all, but I have a vague memory of Lamb Chop from somewhere.\\nWith a name like Captain Kangaroo it sounds Australian related but apparently the name \"kangaroo\" came from the big pockets in the captain\\'s coat * Then she\\'ll be on show at the \"Museum of the City of New York\" from August 13th 2021.\\nI missed a couple of words in the OP. My sister had a Lamp Chop puppet. 😊 I remember lamb chop and Shari Lewis very well, she seem to be on quite a few variety shows in 1960s and 70s too i think.\\nI sure don’t remember her On Captain kangaroo but I was never a fan. Remember there was a rabbit puppet on that show, I thought very annoying and never funny. I did like Mr. Green jeans just for his name. Just for the record. I think Shari Lewis got top billing. :) The 8/2 issue of New York magazine has a photo spread on this. I know there was a Lamb Chop but it is just a vague awareness. Much like I have a vague recollection of Bozo the clown who would probably give me nightmares if I saw him walking down the street. Thanks for that Stephen King. I remember that show and didn\\'t like it. Even as a 6 or 7 year old, or whatever, I found Shari Lewis sickening, the kind of smothering adult kids like me naturally distrust. I liked it even less than \"Ding Dong School with Miss Frances.\" On the other hand, \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie\" was something I\\'d probably still enjoy today. IIRC, they made a cameo on the tv-series Nanny once? My wife and I have been to NYC a few times. But our 11-year old son has never been. We arrive Saturday evening and leave on Tuesday morning. That gives us full days on Sunday and Monday. We already booked tickets for the Statue of Liberty (10:00 on Monday). We also want to go up the Empire State Building, visit The Met, and wander a bit. Other than those three things, we are open. The problem is that I am just not sure what to do and how to do it efficiently so we maximize our time. We can handle long days and are not opposed to walking and using the subway. Suggested things to see and do, and itineraries, are welcome! We are staying in Midtown a few blocks from Times Square. Have you asked your son what he would like to see? When is your trip? (Weather can make a difference)\\nWith only 2 days, I\\'m not sure I would take the time to go to the Statue unless you know he wants to go. There are many cruises that go by it that wouldn\\'t take as long. Also, Top of the Rock is usually preferredas an experience vs the Empire State. It has great views OF the Empire State.\\nWith such a short visit, you might want to do an overview tour. Small bus tours does one\\nhttps://www.smallbustoursnyc.com/\\nOr\\nRealnewyorktours.com\\nuses walking and the subway to get around. If you have SOL scheduled for the Monday, I would visit The Met on Sunday. Those are your two \"big\" attractions that take a lot of time. ESB can be done both during the day or during the evening, depending on which works best with your other activities.\\nAfter your SOL visit, you could spend some time downtown, exploring Lower Manhattan. Some inspiration on things to do and see there can be found.here:\\nhttps://downtownny.com/explore/\\nYou could add walking the Brooklyn Bridge and perhaps walk Brooklyn Heights promenade that day too, depending on what you decide to explore on the Manhattan side. If you want some \\'downtime\\' and simply hang out and people watch, perhaps head to Greenwich village instead, if that\\'s what you want./ need. Washington Square Park is lovely if the weather is nice.\\nDoes your sone have any specific interests? Lots to see and explore in the Met musuem, naturally, for all ages. If he has some specific other interests, perhaps there are some things to add that would interest him. I just returned from a similar length visit to NYC with my children, 14 and 17. First, regarding the Met I recommend planning your visit carefully. It’s huge and easily worth a full day or more. If you just want to spend a few hours, you need to figure out what your family most wants to see. We combined the Met with the Natural History Museum and Central Park. It was a full day. We also enjoyed a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. We visited One World Trade Center this trip, but the Empire State Building is also great. We walked around the Financial District, including the 9/11 Memorial, Oculus, and Battery Park. We didn’t visit the Statue of Liberty, but we viewed it from the Staten Island ferry. We walked the High Line from Hudson Yards to Little Island at sunset. Very cool. My son was looking at colleges, so we went up to Columbia and visited the Cathedral of St John. We also walked around Greenwich Village and the NYU facilities and down to SoHo. We also stayed in the Times Square area. It was fun to experience the craziness, especially at night, but it was usually just in passing to get to/from the subway. We went to MoMA on a previous visit and loved it. I hope this helps. Have fun! Thanks!\\nWe are going next week (arriving Aug 7 in the evening, leaving Aug 10 in the morning).\\nMy son doesn\\'t know himself what he wants to do. He wants to see all that he can.\\nHe does want to go to the Statue of Liberty. I perhaps could have talked him into the Staten Island Ferry and just seeing it from there since the crown is still closed, but I didn\\'t think of it and already bought the tickets.\\nHe also wants to go into the Empire State Building simply because it is so famous (he doesn\\'t even know about Rockefeller Center...we do not live in the USA).\\nAlso, he read a book in his English class about a girl that visited NYC and she went to The Met so it is of interest too. I realize that a lot of time could be spent there, but we\\'ll need to decide what\\'s most interesting there for us and limit our time so we don\\'t miss some other things. At 11 he is not so into museums anyway so I think a couple of hours there should be enough.\\nEdited: 9:08 am, August 02, 2021 If you all want to visit to ESB, then do so of course. It\\'s iconic. However, the advantage of Top of the Rock is that you both can get great views of Central Park AND of Empire State Building. Possibility to get some great shots of ESB from TOTR. Your call what you want to do - I\\'ve done both and enjoyed both but prefer TOTR. Top of the Rock is best visited while there\\'s still some daylight though.\\nAs for the Met musuem, perhaps spend some time in the Egyptian wing, with the Temple of Dendur. This can appeal to all ages.\\nEdited: 9:14 am, August 02, 2021 I\\'ve always been a Top of the Rock fan but after they renovated the way up the Empire State Building, there are so many cool things to see and photo ops before you get to the top, enjoy them. Your son will love them too! As mentioned the Met is huge. I would ask your son to look at their webpage and see what HE is interested in! I think if you are going to SOL already, you should also stop at Ellis Island. IMHO, it\\'s great to should a kid this age how our counters was built.\\nIf you look at the walls outside you may even find your own last name. There is the original section and the new section. Both in alphabetical order.\\nThis is NOT the names of all who entered here but rather names out there as part of fund-raisers by those who cared to contribute. Re Ellis Island: they are from Russia so it may not be of much interest, especially to a young boy, and with limited time, maybe not the best use of their time. Maybe he would like the Harry Potter store? A question to the community...\\nI will be traveling to NYC in mid-October and would greatly appreciate input on whether to use a taxi/car service to get from JFK to my hotel in Times Square or to take the AirTrain/LIRR into Penn Station.\\nI\\'ve read through the numerous postings on Tripadvisor, but I\\'m not sure what is considered \\'rush hour\\' during these mid-COVID times and how it would affect travel time from JFK and/or crowding and travel time on the AirTrain and LIRR.\\nI know it\\'s hard to predict what travel times will be like in October, but I\\'d love the Community\\'s input.\\nHere are some details:\\n--My flight is due to arrive at JFK at 7:30am.\\n--I am travelling alone with one piece of carry-on luggage. Using stairs is not an issue.\\n--I\\'m trying to balance travel time and cost. I don\\'t mind splurging on a car service if it looks to be the best option.\\nThank you in advance for your help! Taxi or air train would both be good. AirTrain is cheaper and less affected by traffic, if you are comfortable with the process, I would go that way Nobody can tell you what the transit situation will be in October. Try asking a week before you arrive and you will get a much more accurate answer. Right now any answer you will get will be mere speculation. If it were me doing this trip tomorrow in current conditions I would take LIRR to Penn. More comfortable than subway and likely less crowded. I wouldn\\'t use a car service during rush hour unless I had too much baggage for trains etc. Not only will it cost much more but you will be sitting in traffic. Again though who knows what the situation will be like in October. If covid cases skyrocket I would probably take the car service, then again if cases were up that high I probably would just reschedule my trip unless it was essential. Keep in mind that some models are showing that the current covid surge is going to peak in mid-October. The travel times of the LIRR and subway aren\\'t changing much because of Covid. Those are pretty consistent. What changes is how crowded the trains are. Transportation by car travel times can vary wildly though and for those travel times it will be best to ask like a week before you come, Thank you for your input! I know that making any plans right now is like trying to hit a moving target and I appreciate your response. Thank you for your suggestions. Arriving at 7:30 might put you at the tail end of morning rush hour, since it\\'ll probably take you a little bit to get off the plane and out of the airport, and JFK is pretty far out from where most people work in the city, so you might not see as much of a crowd as you would if you were actually going to be on the subway at 7:30. I generally find \"rush hour\" to be about 7am to 9am, even during covid times.\\nI flew into JFK recently, and it was an evening arrival on a weekend, so probably not a great comparison, but the air train wasn\\'t especially full and felt fine. The subway can sometimes be a crapshoot in terms of how crowded it is or how safe it feels, but I generally find that the vast majority of people are wearing masks and there\\'s a good air filtration system on subway cars. So overall, it may depend on your personal comfort level, but I think you\\'d be fine taking the air train/subway.\\nThat said, the flat fare from JFK to Manhattan is about $50 (plus tip), which isn\\'t bad. If you decide to go with this option, just use a yellow cab, don\\'t get a car service, and DO NOT use a taxi at the airport that\\'s not a yellow NYC TLC cab. The Yellow cab fare is a fixed rate between JFK and anywhere in Manhattan https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page Figure about $70-75 after tip, misc surcharges and possible tolls. Use *only* the dispatcher line outside the terminal.\\nThe Airtrain is reasonably straightforward - especially if your hotel is within walking distance of the E train https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/air-train\\nThe choice between the two is a decision you can make at time of arrival A friend flew into JFK Sunday night from LAX. Landed about 10:30. When he checked Uber and lyft, surge pricing was in effect and the fare was over $200. So he headed to the taxi line which was where it looks like everyone else was going after seeing the same and the line was very long. Not as many yellow cabs operating and it took over an hour for him to get a cab. If he knew how long it was going to be, he would have taken the airtrain despite the late hour. Only good thing was there was no traffic as it was so late.\\nEdited: 1:35 pm, August 03, 2021 Thank you for your comment! I\\'ve seen a problem with long taxi waits at other airports in pre-pandemic times and that was one reason I was considering a car service. I\\'ll keep your friend\\'s experience in mind! I have never waited more than 10 minutes for a cab from JFK.\\nNever ever....in any kind of weather! Is this your first visit?\\nOne other thing to consider, if this is your first visit, everything can seem daunting and new. The AirTrain is easy but then you have to pay for it at the end of the trip and organise subway/LIRR tickets and then find the train platforms etc. Then alight at the end of the trip and find your hotel. In new cities things look and feel different.\\nI know on my first visit I wished I had taken a taxi to the hotel (I used the AirTrain and subway) because I just felt a taxi would have been easier for me. I could have appreciated the trip into Manhattan from the taxi window and get there without stress. After that, I would have been fine doing \"first time things\" like buying the weekly metrocard ticket, finding stations and platforms, riding the subway etc.\\nEveryone is different and these things might not worry you. But it\\'s something to consider.\\nI\\'ve had to wait half an hour for a taxi at JFK once, though this was in the afternoon.\\nAnd if you do decide on a taxi, don\\'t forget to ignore anyone that \"offers\" you a ride. It\\'s probably a scammer trying to get you to pay more. You\\'ll get the ride into Manhattan at double or triple the cost. Hi all, I understand that we can take an NJTransit train from Penn station to EWR. Just wondering about the luggage capacity on these trains? We will be bringing 4 large pieces of luggage with us as well as 2 smaller backpacks. If you can carrry it, you can take it. Never saw anyone chek how much luggage someone brings. Agreed on \"if you can carry it, you can take it.\" There\\'s no luggage restrictions on NJ Transit that I\\'ve ever seen, and there are usually luggage racks on the train cars where you can store things. As long as you can get the 4 pieces on and off the train, you should be fine. If there are just 2 of you travelling, the questions you should really be asking are: Do we really need to lug 4 large pieces of luggage plus 2 backpacks. Can we reduce the amount of stuff to fit into no more than one not-too-big suitcase with wheels and one backpack each? You will find it so much easier to get around. You can always buy things you need at your destination. And when returning home, don\\'t feel you need to lug everything back with you -- leave the excess for the hotel maid. NJT platform location is announced only 10 mins. prior to departure and there is a rush to the track. There is Red Cap service still in the old Penn Station and they might help if necessary. In the past, NJT used the lower number tracks, but lately, I have found them using 10 and 15 for some runs. Here is a map of Penn Station showing the elevator locations.\\nhttps://jasongibbs.com/pennstation/ Looking for suggestions on what to do in NYC Sunday midday to Tuesday morning. We (the two of us) will have a car with us (traveling from NC) but are happy to use public transport and would likely be more inclined to do so instead of driving in the city. Really love to experience food/drinks, so any best food recommendations are a plus! Likely staying closer to/in the Financial District. Not on a budget per-se, but trying to avoid excessively expensive places/restaurants/events, etc. (we know that NYC is going to be generally more expensive). Thanks very much for your thoughts! NYC is not as expensive as you think, lots of stuff is free or no more than $25 a person.\\nYou can eat cheap too, Pizza is cheap, Bagels are cheap, Takeout Chinese is cheap too (All of them are NY Specialities)\\nYou cant drive around, you need to park the car and either walk or take public transport, you cant park the car on the streets, they don\\'t ticket they TOW. What do you like to do. Have you been to the city before. In the same situation, I would be looking to walk through Central Park, visit an observatory like ESB or one World Trade or Top of the Rock. I would also want to see the Statue of Liberty although with your limited time I would not bother going TO Liberty island ,,, perhaps take the free Staten Island Ferry ot even get a look from Battery Park.\\nAs for food ... what are your preferences. I try to eat things I cannot get at home like good Jewish style deli or Cuban or what have you.\\nHave fun\\'\\nEdited: 12:25 pm, August 03, 2021 You might consider taking an overview tour on Monday.. one option by bus is\\nhttps://www.smallbustoursnyc.com/\\nRealnewyorktours.com\\nUses the subway and walking to get around.\\nD’Or a cruise to see the Statue and the harbor\\nSail-nyc.com\\nis very popular on the forum. They use small historic yachts and also have sail boats. You could do that on Sunday afternoon or evening.\\nWhat kind of food do you like? Btw, you,ll need proof of vaccination to dine indoors.\\nEdited: 1:05 pm, August 03, 2021 Cafe’ Mogador, in the East Village on St marks place. Moroccan food, it’s very welcoming unpretentious and delicious food.. Not pricy in my book. My favorites are the chicken tangine, the hummus and falafel. I eat there alone, love it. It gets very loud inside. Worth the wait which they’re usually is.\\nI checked and they’re doing sit down dining again.\\nAnother welcoming, Unpretentious place not pricy is Casa Adela . This is Puerto Rican food ,really good Puerto Rican food.It’s on Avenue C & E. 5th in alphabet city.\\nCoppelia is another Casual not pricy place with great Cuban food.\\nIt’s on W. 14th St. between seventh and eighth Avenue.\\n. Yelp has good pictures of everything and reviews & prices. If you want something cheap\\nGo to Gracie Mansion , Behind Gracie Mansion is a Ferry. It costs $2.75 , take that Ferry to Wall St and Switch to the Rockaway Ferry (Its a free transfer)\\nYou will see on this ferry ride (It will take around 2 hours each way, you can just return to Wall St and not go back to Gracie Mansion)\\nQueensboro Bridge (Famous from Home Alone, Taxi, All in the Family) , NYC Skyline including all the famous Buildings like the Chrysler Building, Empire State Building , The UN and more , Williamsburg Bridge, Manhattan bridge , Brooklyn Bridge (You will go under all these Bridges including Brooklyn Bridge) , Statue of Liberty (Abit from a distance), the Verazzano Bridge , and Coney Island. This is probably the cheapest and nicest way to see many landmarks) Greetings:\\nVisiting for 4 nights the end of this month.\\nDoes the current situation require advanced reservations—if so, how far in advance….2 weeks enough or more?\\nCould use some recommendations for this trip….wide open to cuisine centered in Flatiron, Gramercy Park, Midtown and/or Village areas. Staying at Edition Madison Park. Could use one recommendation with good food and lively ambiance, possibly with music or nearby (ate at Maialino last time with Rose Bar next door—anything similar??)\\nThanks Depending on where you want to go, and how in demand that restaurant is will determine whether you need reservations. There are still some places that get reserved immediately when the next day opens at midnight, and plenty of places you can walk right in. I tend to make reservations as much as possible.\\nSome of the restaurants that I\\'ve enjoyed in the last year-18 months, which are in the neighborhoods you mentioned:\\nPortale, Rezdora, Gramercy Tavern, Silver Apricot, Lure, Nur, Sona, Mark Off Madison, Llama San, Rosemary\\'s, Morandi, Twelve Chairs, Shuka, The Clam...others that I\\'m lukewarm on but people I\\'ve been with love: Sadelle\\'s, La Mercerie. Eataly is right across the park! So good! Thanks for the tips…yeah, definitely going to hit Eataly….likely Nur and Rezdora…Minetta Tavern always good as well…might even try Timeout Market and/or Lilia (if I can get in) in Brooklyn.…..be interesting to see how “social” the restaurants are and/or if people just show up to eat and then get the hell out of there. Ilili if you like Lebanse\\nABC Cocina - if you like Mexican flavors and inventive dishes. Ilili looks good….and close to 230 5th if a nice day.\\nConsidering drinks one night at Beauty & Essex or Apotheke.\\nOther than that from a tourist standpoint might hit Edge at Hudson Yards and I have to check out Delmonico’s (Continental from John Wick….aware it is closed) since it is somewhat close to a buddy who lives in Battery Park. ilili is great!\\nVaccinations are required for all indoor dining! I\\'m not a local, but Beauty & Essex is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC! The drinks are great, but the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings are divine!! My mouth is watering just thinking about them! Hi everyone,\\nMyself, my wife and my son have booked a trip to NYC for the middle of September. Has there been any talk of restricting travel from some of the southern states. I\\'m in Louisiana and unfortunately, we are slap full of covid deniers and anti-vaxxers. We are vaccinated and I would just hate for this trip to have to be canceled when it is so close. This is so frustrating, I\\'m having real trouble not going off on people that I know that just want to keep denying everything.\\nAnyway, thanks for any feedback. Hoping to see the city soon behind our purple and gold LSU masks.\\nMike No one can foresee the future, but I think it would be politically tough - and more importantly, ineffective - to bring back state-based travel restrictions. Flight requirements based on vaccination status would make more sense, but I’m not holding my breath.\\nHoping your trip can proceed as planned…we also have travel planned for September, so I feel your concern at a very personal level. As of a few days ago the governor of Connecticut suggested travel restrictions coming back are a real possibility if covid cases keep going up and that he would be discussing it with Cuomo. Florida and Texas alone account for one third of all the new covid cases in the entire country. Florida just broke the record for highest number of covid hospitalizations at anytime in the pandemic and they are still weeks away form their projected peak. I understand why some may be skeptical about whether the states will move back to travel restrictions, but I don\\'t think its particularly far fetched especially with how contagious this new variant is and how rampant it is in certain states. No crystal ball here either, but wishing us all lots of luck with it (travel planned for October for me). If only people understood \"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, who am I? If not now, when?\" I really hope your trip goes ahead!\\nI will also be watching for any updates on the travelling situation.\\nI\\'ve a flight from Brussels to New York booked for 30th October.\\nI can\\'t see it happening though. Our trip is in 39 days, mid September as well. Hope we don\\'t have to cancel AGAIN. We have tickets to both Wicked and Waitress, I hope the shows go on as planned. Fingers crossed! Arlo midtown or Moxy EV? We currently are booked with the Moxy. We spend a lot of time around the village so Moxy just seemed better location wise, but Arlo is $600 less. Take the $600, or stay at the Moxy? The East Village is a nicer location but $600 could buy you a lot of daily food and leisure if you stayed at the Arlo. It\\'s a personal call.\\nIf you stayed at the Arlo you could be down in the EV within 20-30 mins.\\nThe Arlo has quite a few sights nearby such as Hudson Yards, the High Line, Chelsea Market, Times Square, Bryant Park etc. The EV is mainly a local area with lots of restaurants. You\\'d need to use the subway to get around sightseeing if you stayed there anyway.\\nIt\\'s a personal decision and you could weigh up your daily plans and where the better location would be for those. I\\'m assuming you\\'re staying more than 2 days with that kind of price difference, and Aynat62 has summed up the exact points I would have done too.\\nBut, ask yourself this, what kind of vacation are you wanting. Are you wanting to sightseeing all the time, or are you wanting to bar hop and go to good restaurants.\\nIf it is the latter, then I\\'d be fine spending more money for the East Village location, if it is the former, and lots of what you want to do is around Midtown then make the change and save the money.\\nI always seem to gravitate towards the hotel the later it gets, so when I have had enough to drink, I don\\'t have far to travel...\\nM Thanks! We will stick with Moxy. Less sightseeing for us and more just walking around and checking out bars and restaurants. Moxy does make more sense with a shorter commute back after a night out https://www.curbed.com/2021/07/vessel-hudson-yards-suicide-dismantle.html?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Curbed%20-%20August%202%2C%202021&utm_term=Subscription%20List%20-%20Curbed\\nhttps://www.curbed.com/2021/01/vessel-hudson-yards-suicide-problem.html\\nI vote for closing the Vessel and turning it into a memorial of trailing flowers and green plants hanging down over the railings, completely covering the structure like a humongous window box Apparently higher barriers were designed and not installed. I think they need to be installed. I am very much against closing it--and not happy that I as someone who is frequently a party of one, can\\'t go!\\nIt IS tragic that there have been suicides. BUT, if we close everyplace where there was ever a suicide... Once again, we\\'re treating the symptom, not the cause. Deal with the issues causing, not higher barriers. When the Golden Gate Bridge had similar problems, they simply designed & implemented a solution. Closing The Vessel down robs the masses of a popular attraction. Add barriers, add a catch net; just fix the problem.\\nEdited: 3:13 pm, August 02, 2021 The obvious solution is to install the barriers that prevent impulse suicide.\\nBut to those who can\\'t climb it - you aren\\'t missing much. The view of the structure itself from the bottom is better than any view you can get up top. I remember that we did the Vessel and the Whitney the same day a few years back and both agreed that views from the roof of the Whitney are better. It reminds me of what one of my art school professors called \"a designer vase on the corporate coffee table\"\\nMeaning some element included to dress up business with a veneer of sophistication, niceness and civic spirit. But, according to the second article, community interests & transparency were not a priority\\nThere are lots of things that are technically \"art\" that are bad art. This seems like a contender Solving the problem of mental illness leading to suicide is not a topic for a travel forum.\\nBut the thing is ugly. Tear it down even if no one was jumping off of it. \"Once again, we\\'re treating the symptom, not the cause. Deal with the issues causing, not higher barriers.\"\\nI agree 1000%. Keep Vessel the way it is. Maybe have people on each floor to monitor people\\'s behavior. Many people have jumped from NYC bridges and have attempted suicide from the WTC Oculus as well.\\nPeople have tried to jump from ESB for one reason or another, and they were stopped.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG0cjUm4txo&t=178s\\nI have been to the top of the Vessel, and I love it. \"But the thing is ugly. Tear it down even if no one was jumping off of it.\"\\nTo each its own. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think it is awesome and gorgeous. I don\\'t think it should be torn down. It\\'s a work of art.\\nInstall the barriers and let those that like it come and enjoy. Don\\'t let the minority ruin it for the majority. It\\'s not a work of art. It\\'s a failed tourist attraction in a failed real estate development. Mayor is set to provide an update on Monday. Let’s speculate....are they going to make mask mandatory indoors for everybody? For unvaccinated only? What say you? Everyone! The ‘Honor System’ doesn’t work — the anti-vaxxers, unvaccinated and \\'disbelievers\\' continued to not wearing masks because they never thought they should have to anyway.\\n😷#wearamask — vaccinated or not! There\\'s a rumor that the city is close to requiring proof of vaccination or recent negative test to enter bars and restaurants, but that\\'s probably just wishful thinking.\\nEdited: 3:19 pm, July 31, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 7:43 pm, July 31, 2021\\nEdited: 7:43 pm, July 31, 2021 In California all have to now wear masks inside again - go figure.\\nAnd for bars in San Francisco one must show a vaccination card. Telling only unvaccinated people they have to mask implies that one thinks they would actually do that - which they won’t. Yea an anti-vaxxer/masker is going to lie about being vaccinated so they don\\'t have to wear a mask. Unfortunately you can\\'t trust some people to be honest. Some restaurants in NYC require proof of vaccination. It wouldn\\'t surprise me if the city began to mandate people be vaccinated if they want to engage in indoor dining. They do it in Paris and I guess according to one of the above posts bars in san fransico have that rule. Under new CDC standards doesn\\'t NYC already fall within \"recommendation\" that all wear masks indoors? I know some businesses in NYC, like While Foods, have gone back to requiring masks on everyone.\\nAnd even at businesses that aren\\'t technically requiring them you hardly see anyone without one.\\nEdited: 7:02 pm, July 31, 2021 Re #7: Yes. Staten Island has \"high transmission,\" the other 4 boroughs have \"substantial\" transmission.\\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/all-nyc-counties-fall-under-cdcs-new-recommendation-universal-indoor-masking The thing I found disturbing when I saw the infection/transmission data a couple days ago was that Manhattan, which used to be at bottom of list, is now in middle, outdone by only Brooklyn and Staten Island. A recently published map of covid \"hotspots\" showed Monmouth County, NJ, to be the worst place in the whole region including Philly and NYC. Staten Island is a second. I just back from a day at the Jersey Shore and no one is wearing a mask. The train there requires a mask. Greetings! I trust this message find\\'s you well! I am an international student and i\\'ll be going to Penn State Harrisburg. However I plan on staying in a hotel near Penn station. could anyone tell me how I can get from JFK Terminal 4 to Penn station? Simple. Take the air train that goes around to the different terminals from the airport to Jamaica station. Take the Long Island Railroad from Jamaica station to Penn station. There are signs along the way. Agree with Red. Take AirTrain to Jamaica station and take Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to Penn Station. how far up the hudson river do tour boats travel? There are some that circle the island of Manhattan. On the Circle Line cruises web site that have sailings diagrams for each different type of cruise and where they go. My family really enjoyed the Best of NYC which went completely around the island in 2.5 hours. The sign in question says “3 hour metered parking COMMERCIAL VEHICLES ONLY Mon - Fri 8am-6pm”. In that case, what are the rules for Saturday & are meters in effect Saturday? If the sign says Monday-Friday, you only have to pay the meter on those days. No meter payment required on Saturday or Sunday. Check to make sure there are no other signs. Sometimes there are multiple signs and you can’t rely on one. That\\'s definitely not my interpretation. Which is that only commercial vehicles are allowed there during the days/hours listed and it\\'s 3 hours metered outside those days/hours. When in doubt, call 311. If the only sign is “3 hour metered parking COMMERCIAL VEHICLES ONLY Mon - Fri 8am-6pm”, it means that only commercial vehicles can park there during those times and they need to pay the meter. And that at all other times, anyone can park there for free.\\nBut there are often more than one sign (such as a different time for street cleaning when nobody can park).\\n(By the way, some commercial zones are active Mon-Fri, and some are active Saturdays as well. Go by the info on the sign). ***If the only sign is “3 hour metered parking COMMERCIAL VEHICLES ONLY Mon - Fri 8am-6pm”, it means that only commercial vehicles can park there during those times and they need to pay the meter. And that at all other times, anyone can park there for free.***\\nThat\\'s how I read it as well Damon. Yes, to Damon\\'s interpretation, and also to checking for any other signs as well.\\nOh and SherX, yes meters are in effect on Saturday.\\nEdited: 1:03 pm, July 30, 2021 #6, I don\\'t think you actually do agree with his interpretation is you think meters are in effect on Saturday. I don\\'t want to speak for anyone else but it looks clear to me he was saying they are not. My interpretation is the same as Hank\\'s in #2 - but I\\'d follow Risa\\'s advice to call to be sure.\\nAnd, if you don\\'t get a definitive answer, just pay the meter - way cheaper than a ticket or a tow (btw, if it is a modern meter or kiosk - which it probably is - it should tell you if payment is not currently required). Thanks everyone for the responses! I find it hilarious that NYC street signs are open to interpretation and require local knowledge to understand. - Passenger vehicles are prohibited from standing Monday – Friday between the hours of 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.\\n- Passenger vehicles are permitted to stand all day on Sunday. Usully you do not need to feed the meters on Sundays. However, Saturdays you usually do (unless it is suspended).\\n- Commercial vehicles are permitted to stand Monday – Saturday between the hours of 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. but must pay the meter.\\n- Commercial vehicles are permitted to stand all day on Saturday and Sunday.\\n- All vehicles are permitted to stand before 8 A.M. and after 6 P.M. on Monday – Friday.\\nI agree with Risa and calling 311. Double checking signs. Especially, if street repair or utility work is to be done after hours.\\nEdited: 1:59 pm, July 30, 2021 This one is one of the most affordable I\\'ve found and good location. Has anyone stay here? When do you look for hotels, how do you make sure they\\'re good? I read the reviews on hotels.com and doesn\\'t sound bad. But was trying to find more info on Youtube and nothing. I have stayed there a few times, the last in 2018. It\\'s fine, clean and convenient to an express subway line. Just make sure you are booking a room with a private bathroom. Ive stayed there twice as well. I liked it just fine or the price. Room was clean & location was convenient. I liked exploring that part of Upper west side. Walking the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis reservoir was on my bucket list and its right there.\\n>>When do you look for hotels, how do you make sure they\\'re good?<<\\nI read reviews on trip advisor, i believe they are reliable. Also on TA page for the hotel they have the keyword search box , I use it to search for certain words - Whatever is important to you - ie safety, cleanliness, storage, ect then any review that uses the word you search for will pop up.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d112039-Reviews-The_Hotel_Newton-New_York_City_New_York.html It,s a decent budget hotel in a more residential area.. you can also look at reviews and photos on oyster\\nhttps://www.oyster.com/new-york-city/hotels/hotel-newton/ >>When do you look for hotels, how do you make sure they\\'re good?<<\\nI use this website too, but I normally filter out the gushingly positive reviews, and the stupidly negative reviews. I find some people everything is perfect for, and they don\\'t actually describe service, room or anything like that, or nothing will be what they\\'ve think they\\'ve paid for.\\nLike nywhiz has mentioned, Oyster is a reasonable website too to look at great photos and walk throughs of hotels - doesn\\'t have them all on, but the vast majority are there.\\nM Hi, I am a student and traveling solo for the first time ever. I chose New York. Is The Belvedere Hotel or Pod good places to stay? Please also share any advice or tips that would be helpful. Thank you in advance! Have you skimmed the thousands of reviews of those properties here on TripAdvisor?\\nAdvice and tips on what? Specific questions get specific answers. There are several Pod hotels. Some of the rooms at the Pod 39 and Pod 50 have shared bathrooms and the rooms are very small. I think the Pod Times Square rooms all have their own bathrooms. These hotels tend to get younger travelers and may be a better option if you\\'re looking to meet other solo travelers. The Belveder is a traditional budget hotel nearish Times Square. Some of their rooms are updated and some not.\\nOyster.com\\nshould have pictures of all these hotels.\\nBtw, are you 21 or over? Some hotels don,t take under 21’s.\\nI agree it would help if you were specific about tips you want. Meantime, on the right column of this page on the full website, not the app, if a column titled “top questions about nyc.” Lots of good info there including one that says tips and hints for first timers. I think the Belvedere Hotel is an a fine location for a first time traveler- it’s about a 15 minute walk to Rockefeller center and it’s near time square but not right in Times Square.\\nYes I agree please tell which Pod Hotel you’re Considering, but I think all three Pods Hotels - Pod times square, Pod 39 & Pod 51 are all well located in Manhattan in safe areas that are good for a tourist.\\nPod 39 in my opinion, is the best located one, a little further away from the noise and the hustle and bustle yet still a good locale. and ***every single room*** at Pod 39 has its ***own private bathroom.*** rooms are super small though.\\nOne bit of advice I will give you is install a transportation app on your smart phone. I use Citymapper it helps me get around like an expert in the city by all modes of transportation and walking , there’s also Google but I prefer a Citymapper.\\nEdited: 3:03 pm, August 01, 2021 Thank you so much!! The transportation app suggestion will be really helpful! I have a bit of a random selection of hotels and trying to decide where to stay for a 5 night stay in mid to late August.\\nThe reasons for the selection:\\n- Trying to limit to properties with at least a fridge and microwave, if not a kitchen or kitchenette.\\n- I\\'m not too keen on staying really near Times Square nor too near the port authority (stayed not so far on last visit and it was ok, but didn\\'t love it). Would love to stay somewhere different, though we\\'ve stayed in the 50s south of Central Park a few times previously and in general liked it.\\n- Budget of between $1,000 to $1,500 (including tax, \"resort\" fees, etc).\\n- Eliminated some hotels where there were a quite a few poor reviews including bad condition of facilities, drug use, syringes in hallways, constant pot smoke wafting, etc. Some of that seemed to be tied to hotels housing homeless population (which they did here, also). While a social good, I don\\'t particularly want to stay in a poor environment like that for my first real vacation in 16 months.\\nHotels:\\n- Beekman Tower (near UN)\\n- Club Quarters Jewel (some better rooms have fridge and microwave)\\n- Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea\\n- Hilton Garden Inn Central Park South\\nI looked at some of the Affinia hotels and some others and was put off by many resort fee shenanigans and the reviews didn\\'t seem particularly better than some less expensive or more transparent properties, but might reconsider if people think they\\'re cleaner and better than others.\\nAlso would welcome suggestions if there\\'s someplace I missed that is a more traditional hotel but would have at least microwave and refrigerator. Also different neighborhoods as mentioned, though not particularly that interested in staying near Wall Street. Might also consider Brooklyn or Queens or upper Manhattan as a different possibility, though hotel selection seems worse in those areas and not sure if a compelling reason. Beekman is too far from a subway stop. All HGI have fridge and microwave, there are lots of locations in Manhattan that I would prefer to the 2 you list. While the renovation at the Beekman Tower looks great, I agree it\\'s too far from a subway stop (especially in August heat) and not a lot around there for a tourist.\\nAll Residence Inns have kitchens and generally include breakfast. The RI Central Park is nicer imo than the Hilton Garden Inn CP with awesome views. There,s also a Residence Inn Midtown East.\\nI don\\'t know what reviews you,re seeing for the Affinias nor do I think their resort fees are shenanigans..merely their policy.\\nHGI Chelsea is ok, but really not in the heart of Chelsea...just south of,Penn station. How about HGI Tribeca, midtown/park Ave or midtown east. Which of those do you think are preferable?\\nI\\'ll also look into the residence inns.\\nEdited: 1:25 pm, July 27, 2021 Are you checking reviews here on TripAdvisor? You mention meh reviews for the Affinias but I\\'m seeing some not so great reviews of these HGI,s and many look tired. If you want a different area, the one in Tribeca might be ok. It’s at a very busy intersection though. I may not have picked the right dates, but I just did a search on booking.com and the San Carlos was the best rated option within your price range. It,s in the east 50’s.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d80112-Reviews-San_Carlos_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html Thanks for the info, everyone. For now I booked a fully refundable queen room at the San Carlos for about $1,200, including all taxes and resort fees. They include fridge and microwave.\\nI may go back and look at the Affinia and other options later, but their least expensive options for a room with fridge and microwave at the Shelburne were $1,500 and were more at the others. Good advice! San Carlos is in a great location! I would go with the Hilton Garden Inn Chelsea for location. Service starts next week\\nhttps://boston.cbslocal.com/2021/07/28/boston-new-york-seaplane-service-preview/ And I imagine there would be some great views since they fly at lower altitudes, no?\\nHowever, I don\\'t think I\\'d want to be in one of those in bad weather. I have flown into LGA in a similar size, 8 passenger, non-seaplane Cessna in bad winter weather, and it was a stomach churning experience I would not want to repeat. It\\'s their apparent planned East River takeoffs and landings that really have me wondering Prop planes are hard on the ears. I once took one from LGA to Hagerstown, MD, The Acela trains take about 3h 45m and cost perhaps $190. They used to keep the Goodyear Blimp at the late Flushing Airport near me. That would be a curious way to travel. Its the same company that does the seaplane flights to the Hamptons. They use the skyport marina terminal on 23rd. You see the planes taking off and landing all summer long. Seaplanes have been taking off and landing in the East River for decades w/mostly Hamptons travelers, so there is nothing new about that. I see them all the time, but mostly in summer, and yes they can be noisy. I don\\'t think there have been any major incidents with them, once something happened down at 23d st at the dock, but am not sure anyone was injured. Small planes like that can be very hot in summer (until you get up in air) and cold in winter, with no flight attendants, no snacks, no bathrooms, no entertainment, so you need to prepare accordingly. Don\\'t forget that general aviation has much higher accident rates than scheduled airlines. #5 - Ahh. So apparently they have experience with deconfliction with the other river traffic.\\nI\\'ve never noticed them. Will keep an eye out when nearby When taking off they become airborne in the general vicinity of the UN, about a mile north of their dock. I haven\\'t seen them land as often as I\\'ve seen them take off, so they may generally approach from south. They are very small planes. I know that short term rentals like Airbnb can be very shady in NYC but we’d like to a rent a furnished place for one month next year. There are lots of websites but I wanted to know if any a recommended. Thanks in advance. My daughter had a good experience renting for a month through nyhabitat.com. The apartment was as advertised and the company was very helpful. Their website was easy to navigate - showed the location and amount of available apartments. Recent thread with some other ideas\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13587753-Luxury_apartment_for_month_long_extended_stay-New_York_City_New_York.html 1871 House (www.1871house.com) offers furnished 30 day rentals (studio and rooms) in their townhome.\\nThis place has been around longer than I can remember. Great location as well. Keep in mind that there is no elevator (as far as I can tell), I didn\\'t know they were still open. Love that location. The Pod Hotel in Midtown has suites and extended stay options called Pod Pads that are like an apartment with full kitchens and separate bedrooms.\\nIf you like the modern style of decor and don\\'t mind Midtown and being a few blocks from Times Square, it might work.\\nhttps://www.podpadsnyc.com/ I\\'d seen images of its facade on Instagram and it\\'s beautifully bedecked in floral splendour. What dreams are made of! It\\'s very pretty on the outside with those gorgeous flowers.\\nI wouldn\\'t mind a hazelnut praline coffee triangle or a couple of pain au chocolat right now. With three batons of chocolate instead of the usual two!\\nHis Hong Kong ventures still seem to be going strong but he\\'s closed London and L.A. We live a number of hours from NYC. So when we have to go, we take a bus. This year the bus co has changed terminals. We used to arrive at Port Authority which was convenient. Now the bus will be arriving at the George Washington Bridge bus terminal. We will arrange for an Uber to get to 58th Street. My question is, never having been to gwb terminal before, where does the Uber usually pick up? What part of the terminal should we exit? Will be there on Mon. Thank you. Somewhere under the overpass at 178th street. There is an indoor mall there with a few stores like Marshalls and I would guess right outside there would be a decent place to call a car. thank you, this is helpful There is a direct connection to the A train from the GWB Bus Terminal. This goes to Columbus Circle at 59th St. While I don\\'t find Port Authority as squalid as many commentators do, it is a palace compared to the GWB terminal. And there may still be construction at the GWB terminal, limiting your stair and door access. Of course, you will be able to get out on the street, but just be prepared with (preferably) wheeled luggage and so on. (You didn\\'t ask, but I do not consider the daytime sidewalks at the GWB terminal to be any more \"dangerous\" than those around PABT!)\\nMake sure you determine departure guidelines (say, entry doors, escalators working, advance ticketing, and likely platform location) for your return trip, while you are at the terminal upon arrival. Thank you, this is all very good advice :) Like many people, I’m pulling my hair out being stuck at home. Since I can’t (don’t want to) travel abroad, I thought New York(!). It’s been a few years and miss it. Not sure if early-mid November or late December would be better. I go back and forth.\\nI’m fully vaccinated and wear masks inside & outside, regardless. I don’t care what CDC indicates is the latest. My mask is on and plan to do my best to remain virus-free. Perfectly happy skipping the meal on the flights there and back. Just want to get out of town and play in New York with family and friends for a week or so, you know?\\nAm I being foolish or is this trip doable, if I’m careful about remaining safe? In a word, yes. Totally doable. I was in NY last October when things were still a little scary, took a wonderful two night trip to Cornwall-on-Hudson to visit Storm King and do some hiking, then returned to the city for five days. Lots of outdoor dining and visits to Central Park. Fast forward to June when the city was virtually back to normal, rode the subway, went to museums, ate indoors. People in NYC have been really good about following Covid recommendations, I’d go without hesitation. I am returning in mid-November two years since my last visit. I am expecting most things to be back to a new normal. Nobody knows what the situation will be by then. They are saying in some models the US could be seeing 4,000 deaths a day by October. Who knows what will happen in NYC with a higher vaccination rate maybe the worst will be confined to other parts of the country. The thing is that Chicago is not very far by plane. It is not like a trip from Chicago to NY would require a ton of planning, so you could play it by ear. I agree you could play it by ear and I would probably go for early-mid November over late December, unless you have a particular interest in Xmas decorations. The weather is usually still pretty good and autumn-like in that part of November. Late December should be okay, but there\\'s always the chance of the odd snow storm or freeze. Also could be very crowded in Dec, with schools out and so many visiting that time of year. I used to love NYC at Xmas, but have come to dislike it very much mostly because of crowds and in normal times sometimes try to get away. I have a friend taking the reverse trip(NYC > Chicago) on Friday morning. She isn\\'t really concerned about much and will take normal precautions.\\nYou are not being foolish at all. As already mentioned, one could plan a Chicago > NY trip with a few weeks notice. So no need to rush into anything.\\nFall or Winter? Whenever you have the time and the prices look good to you. As mentioned, the Covid situation is very fluid at the moment. Everyone was hopeful of declining restrictions and a return to normal this summer, but things are not working out that way. Autumn in New York is normally a nice time. December has holiday things that normally attract many visitors. The week after Christmas is when the Met Museum is usually most crowded with lines up Fifth Ave. to get in. Snow often holds off until January. I\\'d do some planning but make sure any bookings are fully refundable *upon your request* (not at the option of the vendor) so you can monitor things and make your own final decision closer to your travel dates I’m thinking of doing the reverse trip to see my daughter’s (no longer quite so) new apartment & neighborhood, and concur with the others who’ve mentioned that this is a trip that lends itself to playing-by-ear. Flights are generally available and inexpensive (and so short that I’ve never even been offered a meal on one, maybe pretzels or a cookie). Book a cancelable hotel (if you even need a hotel), and you should be golden. There are tons of low-risk things to do here.\\nOne consideration for early November is the marathon, which is on this year (albeit with a reduced field). That may impact hotel availability and make flights more crowded.\\nHave you thought about coming earlier to take advantage of outdoor arts exhibits and activities? Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Was surprised to see more hotels with resort fees. I’m leaning towards November, eager to get back to a couple favorite restaurant, get a sandwich at 2nd Ave., etc.\\nEdited: 8:23 am, July 28, 2021 I\\'ve not been to Chicago late December but I\\'d have to imagine being from there you can apply what you know about the positives and negatives of visiting a potentially cold city around Christmas/New Years.\\nDespite not liking crowds or shopping I really like NYC around that time. But I stay with a friend so don\\'t have to worry about elevated hotel prices or availability challenges if not planning very far in advance. Many people will get a great price on a room through a site like Priceline, Expedia or one of the many other third party travel sites. Somewhere in their agreements with these hotels there must be be wiggle room for them to cancel you out at your chosen hotel and move you to another property. Most of the time you won\\'t know until you check in. They do this because if they see you have say a $99 room, and demand has since gone up and they can get much more, ie $200-$250+, they will move you to some other property for your price. Be aware of this because in NYC this happens a lot and there is nothing you can do about it. You will see comments of those who had this happen to them on this site and it happens particularly in NYC. Just beware that booking through another website does NOT guarantee that you will end up checking in to your chosen property. FYI Any specifics on who is doing this and what excuse they give for the move? Aren\\'t hotels similar to airlines in that they will overbook to avoid unused capacity (due to cancellations etc) and maximize occupancy & profits? The switcheroo.....that didn\\'t work!\\nSo back in 2004, the Boston Redsox won the World Series. I am a Mets fan but my colleague at the time was/is a HUGE Redsox fan. We are at work the day after they win and he is talking about the parade and going. I am game.\\nOur boss\\' boss(Mets fan) was in a conf room meeting and we walk in and say that we need to take a 1/2 day. Why he asks? We are going to Boston for the parade. He laughs and says....knock yourself out.\\nI was in charge of getting us a hotel and my friend was in charge of getting us there/back. He booked Amtrak and I am searching for a hotel. It seemed that every Redsox fan in the world wanted to take part in the parade as they had not won the World Series in 85 years. Hotel availability was scarce.\\nI finally was able to book a room at the Ritz aided by my Amex. That was not my first choice.\\nWe get to the hotel and they say that our room was not available and tried to push us off to another hotel not in the immediate parade area. Nope..not having any of that nonsense especially with a confirmation # in my hand and my Amex status behind me.\\nAfter some back and forth, they say that they have a SUITE available for the SAME PRICE that I had the previous room booked for.\\nLead on!\\nThe suite was basically a luxury 3 bedroom apartment with all of the sides! We walked in and could not believe what we scored. We were only staying for 1 night, but I was not going to let them push us to another lesser/out of the way hotel.\\nBonus...when we got in the cab from the train station to the hotel, the driver asked where we were going. We said the Ritz. He said, Manny Ramirez lives there. Manny was/is probably one of the greatest right handed hitters in the history of baseball and on the Redsox championship team that year.\\nMy friend and I went out that night(it was Halloween week/end) and used the line that we were Manny\\'s financial advisors from NYC(he lived and went to high school in NYC).\\nPerks! 2 years ago I booked a room in Santorini on trivago. When I got to Santorini, it seems trivago had mapped the hotel room incorrectly as the hotel didnt have me listed and now I am in Santorini without a hotel room in high season. I went to a travel agent (They have them all over Santorini selling tours, rentals and other stuff) they got me a hotel room (nowhere as good as the first one and actually facing the other side of the mountain)\\nI put a chargeback with AMex and in the end, Trivago paid my hotel room in Santorini, Even thought it was not what I wanted, for Free I am willing to be a little more forgiving It may be overbooking or it may be that someone or some people who were supposed to check out didn\\'t. I don\\'t think there\\'s much a hotel can do in a case like that.\\nYears ago, when I lived in San Francisco, a work colleague was booked into the Barclay, a hotel I think he regularly stayed at. When he arrived in the evening they had no room and wanted to send him somewhere else. He was so mad he called friends in Connecticut, walked down the street to Grand Central, and took a train to stay with them in CT at goodness knows what hour. I believe he later received a letter of apology from the manager of the Barclay, though don\\'t know if he ever stayed there again (this all happened long before the Barclay was taken over by Intercontinental). They will just say they are overbooked. It\\'s like a Seinfeld episode--they know how to TAKE the reservation; they just don\\'t know how to HOLD the reservation. So no specifics?\\nNot sure the point of this thread or why in the NYC forum. I once had a switch, but was a technical issue that caused it. I wouldn\\'t call it a \"switcheroo\" which i\\'ve never heard of before in NYC.\\nMight as well share the story.\\nI had a booking. I then changed the booking by a few days (way way in advance), when I confirmed my flights etc.\\nI get there, and there is no room in my name - it\\'s still on my old dates.\\nI show e-mails, but they are fully booked, and they\\'ll honour my booking, but have to move to me another hotel for that one night. I\\'m in Brooklyn, their other hotel is in Manhattan.\\nThey book me a car service there, and I get to the other hotel.\\nThe next day, they reimburse (by crediting my hotel bill) the cost of the taxi back to them.\\nI also got a few free drinks in the process, expensive drinks, i\\'m not stupid.\\nAll because of a technical issue on their side where one system had the booking right, but the other one didn\\'t.\\nM ^\\nNice service from the hotels. Hi all,\\nWe are driving from NYC to Watkins Glen - what are some things we could do enroute?\\nWe are think of dropping into Ricketts Glen State Park which has a few waterfalls - which is what the kids like. Not sure they are close to the parking area. Hope so or within 30 min walk or so.\\nAny other recommendations? It can be historical, nice cafes, parks, waterfalls or other things...\\nThanks! Not quite along the way, but the Corning Museum of Glass is a world class collection.\\nhttps://home.cmog.org/ -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 7:25 pm, September 10, 2021 Check out the Delawater Gap in PA.

We stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn in Corning.\\nWe hit many of the places that have been mentioned on this thread already.\\nI don\\'t recommend driving from Ithaca to Cooperstown, I believe that Siri had it in for me the route I took. TP, never hit the road, especailly on a route you don\\'t know without at least having looked at a map. I was once driving from Syracuse to West Virginia & at one point the GPS had me driving in circles so I stopped at a fast food for lunch & they helped straighten me out. Luckily I had picked up a free map in PA at a rest stop. When I got to my destination, I tried to figure out where the gps went wrong. On the way back home, I followed my own route at the problem point. My gps kept trying to get me back on its route & I ignored it. Almost as if magic, the minute I to myself this looks familiar the gps picked up an the correct route. The Delaware Water Gap is about halfway between NYC and Watkins Glen if you go west first, then north (which my google maps always recommends). It\\'s really pretty, but gets crowded on weekends. My husband I arrive tomorrow. This is his first time and I’m so excited to share it with him. I’ve been twice before but the last time was 2007. We are staying five nights split between Residence Inn Central Park and Marriott Downtown. Just looking for thoughts on the way I’ve organized our days? Also suggestions for dinner Monday evening.\\nFriday-Arrive 12:30 JFK (Residence Inn)\\nTop the Rock (5pm)/ St. Paul’s cathedral/Times Square\\ncentral park-\\nTavern on the green 7:15pm\\nSaturday-\\nEmpire State Building Sunrise/NYPL/Grand Central Station/Met\\nChez Josephine 5pm\\nSunday-(Moving day from Residence Inn to Marriott)\\nHigh Line/Little Island (5pm)/Chelsea market/Friends apartment\\nRH Rooftop 5:45pm\\nMonday-\\nStatue of Liberty/Ellis Island Battery Park/ Tenement Museum/Katz deli (lunch)\\nTuesday-\\nBrooklyn bridge (dumbo take ferry to Brooklyn and walk back). Time out market\\nYankee Game\\nWednesday- Depart Newark\\n9/11 Museum/Memorial/Trinity Church/Financial district Staten Island Ferry/ lunch\\n8:05pm flight home Friday\\nYou mean St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral. St. Paul\\'s is downtown.\\nTavern on the Green is not considered very good food.\\nSaturday\\nThe ESB is not open at sunrise. You might do sunset. BUT not if you’re dining at 5. That,s pretty early for NYers . If you’re going to chez Josephine for music, not sure it starts that early.. Have you booked your SOL/Ellis and Tenement museum tickets?\\nBook the SOL ASAP https://www.cityexperiences.com/new-york/city-cruises/statue/\\nBring your proof of vaccination for https://www.tenement.org/ Yes, St. Patricks on day 1. Your timings need some room on day 1 also.\\nMonday is packed before lunch, and yes, do you have your SOL/EI tickets?\\nI would skip the Staten Island Ferry as you would have already been to the SOL/EI and had some nice views. Loeb Boat House is also in Central Park & the food is much more tasty. I think all your days are planned well, it\\'s not too busy and you\\'ll be able to relax along the way.\\nMonday though, I\\'d have lunch at Katz\\'s before going to the Tenement Museum. It\\'s only a 5-10 min walk between the two. Or have a late lunch at Katz\\'s (and just have a snack at one of the cafe\\'s on either Liberty island or Ellis Island) which might even suffice for dinner as well.\\nThe ESB Sunrise sounds nice but very early, and they\\'re pretty pricey at $114.00 per person. You\\'ll have plenty of time for the rest of your day after that.\\nOn your final day I assume you will be going into the 9/11 Museum itself? That\\'s a very sombre and harrowing place with the exhibits in there. Be prepared to feel down afterwards. I think going on the SI ferry will be a good way to clear your head and also see the skyline from the water and contemplate the current view. For your dinner on Monday evening, after going to Katz\\'s for lunch or a late lunch, would you want a full sit down dinner?\\nIf not, you could call into Brookfield Place which is near your hotel (assuming you mean the Marriott Downtown hotel that\\'s on West/Albany St). In Brookfield Place there is Hudson Eats and Le District, offering all sorts of casual foods.\\nhttps://bfplny.com/food/ I agree, skip Tavern on the Green. It is not what it used to be. Also, you will not have time for Top of the Rock at 5:00 and St Patrick’s and Time Square and getting to Tavern OTG by 7:15. I would plan a later dinner so you can wander in Central Park for a while. The Boat House is a better option or there are many great places on the UWS/Columbus Circle area.\\nEdited: 10:12 am, July 30, 2021 Monday doesn\\'t work. You are not allocating enough time for TOTR. You show up at 5 then have to wind through security, photo opp and elevator wait. We sailed through all of that one one visit. On another, it was at least 30 minutes til we were up top. Once you get up there, there are multiple levels and vantage points. You don\\'t want to be rushing.\\nTimes Square is best at night so don\\'t bother going daytime unless you also plan a night visit. And vice versa with central Park. Were you trying to fit actually visiting CP in after TOTR and before your dinner reservation? I was a little confused with the timing of this:\\nHigh Line/Little Island (5pm)/Chelsea market/Friends apartment\\nRH Rooftop 5:45pm\\nIf this is your plan for the whole day, it\\'s a little light, if your ticket for Little Island is at 5, you won\\'t get to RH Rooftop until later...which is fine. You can also check out the Meatpacking District (RH Rooftop is right in the center of it, across the street from the Gansevoort Hotel) while you\\'re there. I\\'ve walked home from there to the Financial District, it\\'s under an hour walk and it\\'s early enough. Or walk until your feet give out.\\nI agree that your timing is rough on your SOL day...not sure what time you are starting, and when you will get to Katz\\' for lunch. You may want to grab something earlier to tide you over.\\nYou may want to go to one of the restaurants on Stone Street or to Fraunces Tavern for lunch on your last day, close to where you will be. Not a surprise, it is basically a protective measure. Fully agree with Risa, totally ridiculous. Ugh. As a frequent solo traveler I agree this is ridiculous. Seems completely inappropriate to say an individual can\\'t enter, especially given the number of individuals who travel through NYC. It\\'s discriminatory and I hope someone sues them soon. Also, it just protects them. At the risk of sounding crass and unfeeling (but it comes from the opposite), if someone wants to commit suicide, they’ll find a way. Shutting down one option isn’t a cure. If they really cared, they would commit a percentage of profits to mental health or something. It’s offensive and absurd to demonize single travelers. Yea it isn\\'t like suicides suddenly stopped in NYC when they shut the vessel. If some guy shoves his wife over the side are they going to ban all married couples?\\nEdited: 11:42 pm, May 25, 2021 Before reading the comments, the legality of this came to mind. While I have reached an age when I would not venture up it, I would most likely go alone and would now be banned. I can easily understand the concern. People on the ground could be killed by those jumping off. The liability seems immense. From the article \"Rather than install taller glass barriers on walkways of the vertical sculpture\" and \"The Vessel was envisioned as a shared, immersive design experience. Requiring visitors to attend in groups of two or more significantly enhances the safety of the experience,”\\nThis seems like a retroactive rationalization to avoid correcting a possibly fundamental design flaw. Seems like something that should have been considered as part of the development process.\\nFor anyone who has been there - how high are the railings? I have read rave reviews about Ziggy, but the website says he is no longer doing tours. Thoughts on next best? Ziggy\\'s tour would have been perfect but he\\'s not running them anymore.\\nMaybe take a look at the Free Tours by Foot food tour. They\\'re not as small group as Ziggy\\'s tours were but they might suit you. They are technically \"free\" with just a tip at the end for your tour guide ($15-$20 per hour per person in your group) and you pay for whatever food you decide to eat along the way.\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/new-york-tours/free-east-village-food-tour/\\nAnd you might want to look into the Foods of New York tours and the Secret Food Tours but I don\\'t know if the East Village is included. Greenwich Village is.\\nhttps://www.foodsofny.com/\\nhttps://www.secretfoodtours.com/new-york/food-tours-new-york/\\nThis one does do East Village food tours : https://avitaltours.com/nyc-food-tours/tour/east-village-food-tour/ For your own self-guided, carb-loaded mini food tour: Le Fournil, excellent French bakery with the best baguettes I’ve had outside of France (ok, or Montreal).

Might be helpful for visitors\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/23/travel/lower-manhatten-guide-summer.html?searchResultPosition=1 That\\'s a really good article.\\nI picked up a couple of places. I hope no one planned on the concert in Wagner Park tonight since it’s raining pretty fierce right now, although the stage was set up this morning. The River and Blues concerts are one of my favorite summer things to do, really laid back and good music. They’ve been doing them every Thursday in July for 20 years now, so it’s a good bet you can plan on next summer.\\nA few comments on the article:\\nLe District isn’t exactly a marketplace anymore, it’s turned into a crazy busy scene restaurant, if that’s your thing, but the quieter River House is in a really nice almost secret location nearby.\\nThe Seaport is morphing into a much nicer version of itself since some of the low-end stores have closed. Although there’s some emptiness right now, like everywhere else, Front Street is usually busy in the evenings with lots of street dining.\\nI think Pier 15 gets overlooked by tourists, but there’s a lively bar on the bottom level and nice relaxing vibe with views on the upper one. There have been several fun but short-lived installations on the plaza next to Pier 17, and you can sometimes see cormorants in the water there. Pier 16 is a major hangout for dogs in the mornings which is fun to watch. Thanks for adding input BPnyc. Is River House you mention same as Merchants River House? If yes, I was actually there a pre pandemic at Risa\\'s suggestion, I think. It’s a nice spot. So is Le District no longer a bunch of stations with different foci? I always enjoyed the oyster/wine bar area. According to the website, Le Bar has oysters.\\nhttps://www.ledistrict.com/le-bar Yes, I should have used the whole name to avoid confusion: Merchant’s River House.\\nOmoshiroi, Le District closed not long after the beginning of the pandemic. The grocery part made a stab at staying open but didn’t last long as the businesses were all closed and a lot of residents had left the area. They still do crepes and the coffee and ice cream places that are in the very front are open, but all those take-out stations and the wine bar are closed. The outdoor restaurant is crazy busy as you might imagine. There have been several rumors about what it will be next. I just got back from the Van Gogh on Vesey St (the “other one”). I cut through Brookfield to walk home because of the rain. Noticed a good happy hour crowd at Seamores still going strong. Despite the rain, quite a few tourists around Wall St/NYSE (helped some find their Uber).\\nI agree w BPNYC that the Seaport has reinvigorated itself (again) and lots happening Piers 15-17. I went for a drink at Carne Mare a few weeks ago. Decor is a cross between a steakhouse and an upscale version of a Jersey shore nautical design. Friends had dinner, I just had drinks. Looked busy.\\nBtw, I liked the VG Experience. It got better and better. And the virtual reality thing at the end is trippy - super fun! Exactly what I was hoping for in terms of entertainment to wake up the senses after a rough year. I went to MoMA on Tuesday to see Starry Night to get in the mood (and to see Cezanne drawings. The automotive exhibit was a bonus).\\nJust saw BP’s addition. Yeah, I’ve been one of those people at Liberty Bistro all year. I think the food is just meh. But it’s convenient and has great views. And the outdoors is covered in the rain, I’ve been there in the rain several times.\\nEdited: 8:23 pm, July 29, 2021 My friend and I are no longer going in the trip and we already paid for tickets and would hate for them to go to waste. Hi everybody\\nI’ve been to nyc a couple of times and never needed a car. However, this time I’m traveling in a group of 6 that includes me, my wife, our kids (9, 5 and a 10 months old) and a grandparent. We intend on sleeping in Brooklyn (boerum hill/slope/…) .\\nI’m just wondering with such a group, the stroller, and COVID on the loose perhaps a car would be a good idea.\\nWDYT? What are your plans?\\nWhich hotels have you been looking at and how close to a subway (which ones)? For what?\\nParking in Manhattan is expensive and traffic is awful.\\nIf your plan for the car is outer Brooklyn and Long Island then I can see where a car might be useful Unless you have a desire/need to travel to far-flung destinations that aren’t well-served by transit, I think a car is a terrible idea. You will spend a lot of time in traffic, looking for parking, paying for parking, and then walking from where you’ve parked to where you want to be.\\nCovid doesn’t change that answer. Public transit is probably the safest indoor space you can be right now: almost everyone is masked and there are powerful air handling systems. Covid concerns may be a good reason to postpone travel; they’re not a good reason to rent a car. While mass transit is generally the way to go in this city, given your party size and make up, a car can be useful, especially if the majority of your destinations are in BK/Queens. Even something like Coney Island, while well served by rapid transit, would be made a whole lot easier with a car.\\nIn that vein, why not consider hyper using car services? Let\\'s say a mini-van rental would run you $100 a day. You\\'d likely have to double uber (I never used it, but 6 people sounds like too much) so the costs would likely be more overall, but for just a bit more coin, no headaches, no parking, no getting lost. Parking cost will be substantial\\nA vehicle that can accommodate all of you is likely to be subject to \"oversize\" fees (and not all garages can physically accommodate oversize vehicles)\\nMost garages are valet only so you will spend time dropping off / picking up the vehicle\\nThere is a child safety seat exemption for cabs and car services within NYC\\nFor a rental vehicle you will need to bring or rent safety seats / restraints for some of the children https://dmv.ny.gov/more-info/safety-restraints\\nEdited: 7:33 am, July 28, 2021 I live in Boerum Hill. Absolutely no reason to rent a car while staying there or visiting NYC.\\nThe Nu Hotel on Smith Street has a garage attached to the building and that would be convenient if a car WAS needed and you had less people.\\nHowever, the subway is a few blocks away in either direction(Bergen Street, Jay Street or Borough Hall) and the time you save vs looking for parking wherever you are visiting, paying, walking to the attraction, walking back, waiting for the car/van, repeat, repeat, etc is not worth it.\\nUse the subway. I hate to pile it on but a car in NYC is significantly more trouble than it is worth. In terms of Covid - what happens when you exit the car? (and go into whatever sites you are visiting) if you are concerned about Covid, than maybe travel is not for you at this time.\\nI would also reconsider staying in Brooklyn, You have an infant and a 5 year old ! Being centrally located in Manhattan enables stops back at the hotel to rest and change. You appear to have budgeted funds for a large car. Spend it instead on the Manhattan hotel. 6 ppl (well, 5) in one hotel room can be a challenge. They are probably considering an AirBnb. Most Airbnb’s are illegal in NYC. Brooklyn is part of NYC. Unless you are on a phone, on the right are top questions. The third addresses this. The cost of parking is simply unrealistic and it is difficult to find parking in general. it is worth thinking 1000 times if you need a car there. Hello! Where is some good nightclubs with fun music to dance to in Manhattan? What places are not dangerous versus ones I should avoid? What places are fun? Thanks! Check out Club 205.\\nAnd Bar 13.\\nEdited: 7:42 pm, July 28, 2021 If you like live music, Ohmyrockness has a good calendar\\nhttps://www.ohmyrockness.com/\\nStaying safe now days is mostly masking up.\\nHave fun! Duff\\'s in Brooklyn is great for metal. Sadly, many places are temporary closed or permanently closed.\\nBut, the ones that I am familar: -\\nLe Bain NYC - https://www.lebainnewyork.com/\\nIndustry Bar - https://www.industry-bar.com/\\nA new one that I would like to try: - The Q - https://theqnyc.com/ Another example of NYC opening up and coming back stronger than ever!\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos-explore-little-island-nycs-luxurious-new-floating-park-hudson Been watching it coming since they started it, can’t wait to visit. They have free timed tickets. I just ordered 4 for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. I haven’t been into the city since Covid, so I’m very excited. I live in a northern suburb. ^\\nPlease give us you review after the visit! I\\'ve walked up the Hudson River Park walkway a lot, and it looks pretty cool. Like a bunch of concrete mushrooms arising from the River. I just read an article about it in the NYT yesterday! Definitely want to walk around it when in town for my birthday at the end of June. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/arts/little-island-barry-diller.html Good interview with Barry Diller, who spearheaded this project with his wife, Diane von Furstenberg. Also, some nice shots of the park.\\nhttps://youtu.be/bzmkVKRP-UQ I like it. It\\'s a very ambitious design but the more parks and gardens there are in the city the better imo. And even more great pictures and info. It\\'s so unusual and yet beautiful.\\nhttps://newyorkyimby.com/2021/05/thomas-heatherwicks-little-island-opens-to-the-public-in-chelsea-manhattan.html\\nAnd interesting that there is a connection to the Titanic and Capathia right there.\\n\"Along the railings by the entrance are small rectangular glass panels and a plaque titled “The Unsinkable Ship” commemorating the Titanic and the Carpathia, which rescued the 710 survivors and docked at Pier 54 in April 1912. A separate panel is dedicated to the Lusitania, which sailed away for Europe for the last time from the Cunard pier in May 1916.\" Ter, I wouldn’t say this to anyone but you on this Board. But Diane Von Furstenberg should be credited better than just “his wife.” She’s a driving force of nature, who happens to be married to Barry Diller, it’s a footnote to her extraordinary resume, which includes revolutionizing the fashion industry, philanthropy, and she is a case study for business classes in licensing and branding. I know you know this but I just couldn’t let it go at that phrasing. ^\\nI agree.\\nIf the interview was with her, I would have said DVF....with her husband BD(who is just as influential.)\\nI was just focusing/referencing the interview. Good afternoon -\\nI would like to start by saying I absolutely love the Tripadvisor community and the help that people are willing to give.\\nMy teen daughter and I will be visiting the week of Thanksgiving. We are coming from a very rural area and are NOT familiar in any way with mass transit. I am wondering if anyone could give me some directions of how to get us from the M Social Hotel 226 West 52nd Street, to where the SOL/Ellis Island tours depart from. I literally need step by step directions - not just take the subway. I would say the easiest way - but I believe that would an expensive taxi ride.\\nAnd then also - where to buy tickets for that tour - in an earlier question someone said buy direct - would that be the statueoflibertytickets.com ? or statueofliberty.org? Or something else? So many options pop up when I do a search.\\nAfter that tour I believe we are going to the 911 Memorial and I think I can figure out how to get there.\\nBut then after that - would someone mind telling me how to get back to hotel?\\nThanks in advance! I am a little overwhelmed by the idea of this. This is the official ticket seller for the boat to the SoL and Ellis Island\\nhttps://www.statuecruises.com/index.html Put the address of your hotel into google, then click on directions.

Enter your starting address and the end point and the planner will give you several options to get to/fro. I fully agree with getting familiar with the MTA Trip Planner:\\nhttp://tripplanner.mta.info/MyTrip/ui_web/customplanner/TripPlanner.aspx\\nGoogle maps is good, but for specific subway information, the official MTA site is a wealth of information. Hi, can anyone recommend a jazz club near W. 54th? Is Coney Island worth visiting (we will not be traveling with kids)? Thank you. Coney Island is fun. Well worth a visit Just FYI, don’t know when you’re traveling, but Coney Island can also be a fun summer evening destination, especially on Friday nights, when there’s a fireworks display over the beach. I also think that CI is worth a visit on a nice day.\\nYou can of course take the subway there and see the rides appear as you start to get close. Stop for a Nathan\\'s hotdog and cheese fries. Then walk around a bit before having drink at Ruby\\'s(don\\'t expect a posh interior, but well worth having a drink there) on the boardwalk.\\nThen hit the beach if only to walk a bit on the sand. You could then check out the NY Aquarium and/or walk all the way down to the heavily populated enclave of Brighton Beach.\\nFriday? As Linda said, stick around for the fireworks. Or call it an early evening by taking a different train home. Oh...go on the rides, if you choose to, BEFORE you eat. Would not want anything coming up on anyone! jazz club near W. 54th ....look up Dizzy\\'s Also look up NYC Jazz clubs and see who is performing. I would base my selection on the talent, not necessarily the location. If you go to the CBS Sunday Morning website, they did a feature on Coney Island just this past Sunday. Iridium Jazz club is near west 54 st. But won\\'t be open til October.\\nhttps://www.theiridium.com/\\nDizzy”s mentioned by Jenny is not far and open\\nhttps://2021.jazz.org/dizzys-club\\nConey Island has rides, a beach, a boardwalk and some restaurants.

Last time I came through there was Dunkin, Starbucks, Mezze and the pizza place at food court and that was all there was in Terminal 8. Assume COVID related. Coming through this time (tomorrow, mid days) with hungry teens and a 5 hour layover. T8 again.\\nIs it worth taking AirTrain to another terminal. Or\\nIs is still basically all grab and go? Any suggestions appreciated. Kids eat anything - Thanks Check what is open at the TWA Hotel/complex. You can easily kill several hours there. have you checked the official link?\\nhttps://www.jfkairport.com/at-airport/shops-restaurants-and-services Doesn\\'t look like it https://www.jfkairport.com/at-airport/shops-restaurants-and-services\\nCheck the https://www.twahotel.com/ That looks cool. Thanks! Assuming we have to come back through TSA since we are changing terminals ? Thanks. It’s sorta hard to tell.\\nSome say “grab and go” while others are listed as “restaurant” implying service. May roll the dice and hop the air train. Terminal 8 has literally 4 places open. 7 and 1 seem to have some choices. Though many are past TSA not beforehand. Gets to be a hassle to hop the train to another terminal, only tk have to go back through TSA at T8\\nBut we do have 5 hours🤪 Yes if you change terminals you will leave the secure area and have to allow time to re-clear the TSA when you return to T8 https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/air-train\\nDon\\'t think you can access anything post-security in another terminal\\nThe TWA Hotel could be fun\\nThis is a decision you can make at time of arrival - maybe scope out what\\'s available in T8 and then decide Yeah. Good call on post TSA. I read about hotel. Sounds cool. And it sounds like the Paris cafe is in fact open for\\nSit down Yes, there are some open--a student of mine is a waitress in one of the terminals and she was finally called back to work in June. I believe she works in terminal 7 or 8. I found some old posts from several years ago about filming locations for Law & Order but nothing recent. Is there a way to find out if they are filming while we are there in September.\\nMy granddaughter is named after Olivia Benson and it would tickle her to death (and me, too) to get to meet her or at least see her. Check https://onlocationvacations.com/category/daily-filming-locations/ closer to your travel dates\\nOutdoor filming locations tend to be in outlying areas that may not be easy to get to and the chances of seeing the actors is relatively small\\nYou might also want to check Mariska Hargitays\\' twitter or instagram chances of seeing actors is relatively small, but it can happen.\\nI once walked out of my hotel in Williamsburg, and nearly bumped into Donnie Wahlberg as he was filming an episode of Blue Bloods around the corner..\\nM Hi,\\nWe are a mixed group - tourists, locals, kid , teen, people in 40s. Not super active, but moderately active.\\nWe are located downtown Manhattan. Should we take the A train from Fulton Street or the ferry from Pier 11 to go to Rockaway?\\n- How well is the area around the ferry terminal kitted out? Bathrooms? Shaded areas? Concession stands? Nice sandy beach? How long a walk is it from the prime beach area and the ferry terminal?\\n- Or are we better off taking the train?\\nRelated question: Should we do Coney Island/ Brighton beach rather than Rockaway? I understand that the vibe is different...\\nThanks for your advice! Take the Ferry its a much nicer ride, the A train goes through some sketchy parts of Brooklyn, you will be OK, but The ferry is like an adventure by itself Agree w Howard. Why sit almost entirely underground when you can sit outside on top of the ferry w views of the Statue of Liberty and Bayonne Bridge (if you know where to look), a lighthouse, go under the Verrazano Bridge, the Marine Park bridge, see Coney Island beach…etc. it’s such a pretty ride. The beach is a few short blocks. I wouldn’t say it’s a beautiful beach. The buildings behind are just hideously unattractive. But sand and water is always beautiful. Thanks!\\nWhich are the best areas of the beach to perch ourselves, keeping in mind conveniences like bathrooms and concessions?\\nThere seems to be a shuttle bus that we need to take from the terminal.. does it run on holidays/ weekend? Here is info from the website: https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/rockaway-beach-and-boardwalk/facilities/bathrooms I normally take the train, but that\\'s because I\\'m starting out in Brooklyn. It emerges from underground on the far end of Brooklyn (I think around Grant, could be wrong), and you actually get some nice views of neighborhoods and Jamaica Bay (there\\'s a pair of osprey nesting by the bridge).\\nBUT the views don\\'t compare with what you\\'ll see from the ferry, by a long shot. The shuttle bus definitely runs on weekends and holidays . . . that\\'s when it\\'s busiest. And that points to the only real disadvantage of the ferry: on peak summer weekends, it can get very crowded.\\nAs far as beaches go . . . it\\'s a tradeoff between amenities and beach quality/vibe. I personally prefer the area around Riis Park and (especially) Fort Tilden. Riis has extensive bathrooms and food options; Fort Tilden does not - it\\'s a more natural setting - so it may not work for your group. But it\\'s beautiful! If you just want to go to the beach, Skip Rockaway altogether and either go to Long Island or the Jersey Shore.\\nWhile I prefer Robert Moses State park, Jones Beach is a little closer to the city\\nThere is also a nice ferry ride to Sandy Hook, NJ and NJ transit goes to Long Branch (A nice beach) To clarify - to get to Riis/Fort Tilden, you would NOT take the A train. You can get there via the 2/5 to Brooklyn College to the Q35 bus (not as much of a pain as it sounds, but definitely a pain), but I think you\\'d find the ferry MUCH more enjoyable. Howard, have you been to the beach at Fort Tilden? It actually reminds me a lot of RMSP and is much easier to get to without a car. to get to Robert Moses you take LIRR to Babylon and take a Bus to the Beach\\nTo get to Jones Beach take LIRR to Freeport and take Bus to beach\\nWhile not the best Photo Ive ever taken, This is Robert Moses (Actually about 1/2 short walk from it)\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CQXBoZ4tBsU/ Interesting from my house, While Fort Tilden is Closer, its quicker to get to Jones Beach This amazing thread was started a while back by Ztaks which highlighted some amazing events taking place in nYc.

Need a shuttle or car service to Sofitel New York hotel. Prices seem to be almost quadruple what they were about 5 years ago. Any insider info to find the best deal? There will be two of us with our luggage. Also need a return to JFK on 12/3. Third option: Take a taxi. Fixed rate to Manhattan (+ tolls and tip). Only use the official ones though. Due to the pandemic, shared ride services are still suspended - it is unclear when they might resume\\nA Yellow cab between JFK & anywhere in Manhattan is a fixed rate (~$75/cab after tip and possible tolls) https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/taxi-car-and-van-service On the right hand side of this page (not visible on phones, however), is a list of common questions. The first one is about getting to and from the airports. Here are all of the options:\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13187699-How_do_I_get_from_the_airport_JFK_LGA_EWR_to_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html I would simply take a taxi from the official taxi line outside JFK. I hate when people make comments like your (quadruple???) with no specifics. What price did you see that,s quadruple??? The shuttles are mostly not running (and were never recommended on this forum). So are you comparing a shuttle price with a private car service and claiming prices have quadrupled?\\nUBer and Lyft are options. A car service like\\nCarmellimo.com\\nis another option. Do not accept a ride from anyone who approaches you that you have not booked. There are lots of scams. You could also check with Diel 7. ***I would simply take a taxi from the official taxi line outside JFK.***\\nFully agree, taxi is the easiest way, plus it\\'s a fixed rate from JFK to anywhere in Manhattan. Sit back and enjoy the ride. I recommend using Dial 7. A month ago, I used them for an early Sunday morning flight out of LaGuardia. Uber may be a cheaper than a taxi, depending on the time of day. Price out a car service and determine the total cost. A taxi is fixed rate and you would expect to pay between $70 to $75 including toll/tip. Aside from almost certainly being cheaper than a car service another advantage to hopping in a cab is there is 0% chance of a mix up. You could find a \\'reliable\\' car service but you\\'re still dependent on one driver and one car and stuff happens. Somewhat controversial, but i agree. Indian food has been having its moment lately. So many innovative and awesome new Restaurants/ideas keep coming up and take it to the next level. Really exciting stuff for Indian food lovers in my opinion.\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-22/new-york-now-has-better-indian-food-than-london Linda E was at Dhamaka recently and loved it. I have looked at their menu (and read the article) and have experienced revulsion and nausea at the descriptions of goat kidneys, goat testicles and rabbit (I don’t eat any meat). I can’t describe my physical reaction just reading the menu. I just can’t imagine going there, no matter how good people say it is.\\nHowever, I was at Sona about two months ago. And it was probably the best meal (or one of the 3 best) I’ve had this year. I cannot wait to go back. We over ordered because it all sounded so good, and just kept eating. It was beyond delicious. I’m a fan. Great. I have tried so many lately..Baar Baar, ARoqa...Gupshup and all were so good and interesting. I will check out Dhamaka this weekend. His other rest. such as Rahi and Adda are legit awesome as well.\\nSona is also on my list. I am loving that they are bringing food from all parts of Indian and not sticking to Tomato and Cream crap in everything. \"goat kidneys, goat testicles\"\\nGoat kidneys, Goat testicles and Goat brains are very popular in Northern India :) I like Gupshop a lot. But totally different class of restaurant - it’s casual and fun, with very enjoyable food. Sona is an orgasmic experience. I can’t wait to hear what you have to say. (And hey, if you want a +1 for Sona, count me in! I’ll go back anytime!). Sweet, will keep you posted..And, that\\'s what I mean that the Indian food scene is touching all aspects of eating from casual to super fine dining.\\nHere is a good one on Dhamaka and its Chef.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29ZP8ADQJ1Y&t=23s\\nEdited: 10:14 pm, July 27, 2021 London has 6 Michelin * Indian restaurants. NYC has zero. Just saying ;) Interesting read, ISDW! You’ll love Dhamaka. My favorite dish there was actually a fish one, the pomfret. (Though as Risa pointed out, it’s a pretty meat-oriented menu, which isn’t a problem for me.)\\nI was thrilled to learn that the team’s Brooklyn venture is going to be right down the street from me. Can’t wait! I apologize for being a Debby Downer.\\nBeing Indian, growing up in the Hindu religion and having a grandmother that catered for large scale Indian events; sadly many NYC restaurant that call themselves Indian are indeed not.\\nIt is not to say that these restaurants serve bad food; for me it is just not Indian. Yes, India has many regions that have different cuisines. But, just using Indian spices does not make a cuisine Indian. It takes much more.\\nFor me, for a restaurant to be considered Indian; most items have to be authentically Indian. Yes, foods evolve and in NYC Indian food has to adapt to the taste buds of the general public. But, you will rarely find this adaptation in India. It usually occurs in a restaurant in India that has a tourist clientele.\\nI cook Indian food mostly every day of the year. My Husband (who is non Indian) learnt to adapt to my cooking style and the spices that I utilize.\\nNow when we decide to go out for Indian food; we are very selective of the Indian restaurants. We do not want an adaptation of Indian food (not that anything is wrong with it - just to call it Indian food is a stretch by way of using Indian spices).\\nSadly, with most restaurant that have authentic Indian food; I will find items that make me go; really? Indian? Indian Food?\\nI like look at a menu and say … ahh I remember that as a child. Have not had that food in forever! It would bring back memories of being a child.\\nAs in Indian culture you never cook for the number of heads in your household. You cook in large quantities. Indian food always tastes better when cooked in large quantities and not so great when you try to cut the recipe. Every Indian relative’s house visited you had to eat something.\\nI also enjoy going to Indian restaurants I favor and being asked to order for everyone at my table. I love showing people what is real Indian food.\\nOne thing to note is that great Indian food takes time to cook. Many Indians wake up in the early mornings and cook throughout the day. Indian food is also best the second day and third day. Never really on the same day it is cooked. This, of course, may not be possible for restaurants in NYC.\\nFor Indian food I recommend (to name a few): -\\n* QUEENS : -\\nTemple Canteen - https://canteen.nyganeshtemple.org/\\nSeva Indian Restaurant - https://www.sevaindianrestaurant.com/\\nDosa Delight - https://www.dosadelightnyc.com/\\nTaste of Bengal - https://taste-of-bengal.business.site/\\n--\\n* MANHATTAN: -\\nChote Nawab - https://www.chotenawabnyc.com/\\nMughlai Indian - https://www.mughlaiindiantogo.com/ShowMenu.tpl?cart=162747270552034183\\nRangoli Indian - https://www.rangolinyc.com/ShowMenu.tpl?cart=162747284552045771\\nOm Indian Food - https://omindianfood.com/\\nEdited: 8:22 am, July 28, 2021 I think everyone realizes food in a NYC restaurant is not going to be the same as Grandma\\'s family dinner. That\\'s true of any type of food even including American. \"Interesting read, ISDW! You’ll love Dhamaka. My favorite dish there was actually a fish one, the pomfret.\"\\nYes, that is something I am most excited about. I ate that dish a lot in Mumbai (where it is very popular), and I have never had a proper one in the West. It kills me when I see Salmon Kabab at rest. here. Keep in mind Salmon is not a native/popular fish in India and is not used a lot in traditional local cuisine. Hi, we will be staying in Manhattan (Central Park area) for seven nights at the end of August. What are some safe nightlife things to do beside clubbing (we are not partiers)? We enjoy comedy clubs, great food, attractions, etc. We plan to do most of the touristy things during the day, but want a couple of options for things at night too. Spend time, if the weather is nice in Greenwich Village. Washington Square Park is really nice. Lots of restaurants in the area too. There are so many places to go and things to do. Dinner or drinks cruises, walks along the River walkways, numerous kinds of entertainment, rooftop bars. And at all kinds of budgets, some free, some require advance tickets.

Your replies were very helpful. Anyone know of a decent Jazz Club? Is Coney Island worth going to? jazz clubs - Dizzy\\'s; Birdland. Since planning an actual trip is way up in the air (instead of me being up in the air - I\\'m sad) at the moment, I figured I should ask.\\nWhat\\'s your travel style - how do you typically spend your money when visiting the city?\\nFor me, typically:\\nExpensive theatre, opera, ballet, concert and / or sports tickets. I do say expensive, because generally they are. And since I\\'m VERY picky with where I sit buying discounted last minute tickets is often out of the question for me. I want to be able to pick and choose among a variety of places so I can find the seat I like - I know my preferences. I think I have once managed to get discounted Broadway box tickets, but that\\'s about it. Good thing is that this means those things are pre-booked and taken care of financially before I arrive so I don\\'t have to budget for it in my day-to-day budget when in town.\\nFood. Yup, food is important for me when traveling. Sometimes quick, casual cheap-ish hole in the wall kind of places but I do budget for spending a smaller fortune on my food budget when traveling. Some splurges, typically, too. And I\\'m by no means a big drinker, I quite often end up with a soda or water - but when I do have a glass of wine or a drink I do want it to be a good one (thus a bit higher price, but since I seldom drink a lot I figure this evens out during a trip).\\nEntrances to museums and such. And I pay extra if there is a special exhibit I want to see.\\nShopping: Very, very little. Boring ... But if I do shop, it\\'s typically in museum shops or book stores most of the time. I’ll play. I’m cheap in some ways, splurge in others. I always use public transportation to/from airport and getting around town. I have only been in cabs a handful of times, mostly if I’m going somewhere not well served by subway/bus.\\nI usually go to a couple of Broadway shows each trip. Always buy in advance because I too want good seats. I’ll use discount codes if available but not a dealbreaker. I almost always go to either a spa or get some sort of massage even if it’s just one in a chair.\\nI do shop but generally to take advantages of places I can’t go to at home. It’s not random, I will often plan in advance what I want to buy on that trip and will stick with it.\\nI am not to extravagant on hotels. As long as it’s safe, clean, and well located I’m good. I used to use Priceline frequently but I now mostly book directly, being a member of many hotel loyalty programs. Same for food. I have been to some nicer places but a corner bodega works if I’m hungry. I think I have made exactly one reservation over all my trips and that was because I knew the brunch crowd where I was meeting anotger TA’er would be unpredictable.\\nLastly, I travel light. Carry on bag only and a small backpack. I hate dealing with bigger luggage at the airport. Quickly!!!!\\nHaving only been once a lot was spent on visiting attractions, worth every cent for the experiences. And like you Maxi the gift shops took a pounding.\\nEating out consisted of diners, pizza and the shack.\\nManaged to fit in a ball game and a river cruise, not overly keen on Broadway shows and unfortunately as we\\'re music lovers no bands we like were playing.\\nOnly visited one bar but bought a few beers for the fridge at the hotel.\\nA bit of shopping was done, sunglasses, handbags and lots of t-shirts.\\nCan\\'t wait to get back and spend more. Scott - forgot to mention, I\\'m being cheap on public transport as well. A combination of subway and local buses take me pretty much everywhere. Been using the local buses more and more with each trip. I think I\\'ve taken a cab maybe twice in total. This is not counting a taxi from and car service to the airport for from Penn Station to the hotel which I sort of regard a part of the \\'travel into the city deal\\' - I usually travel less light and I\\'m not keen on schlepping a large piece of luggage on the subway. The NJ Transit train from Newark is fine though.\\nKrail - HA! It\\'s waaay to easy to spend money in NYC!\\nEdited: 2:38 pm, October 07, 2020 We spend a ton on Broadway, and usually one good meal during our long weekend (2 night) visits to NYC. Usually see 3 shows on those weekends, sometimes 4. And we rarely take the subway, so we save $2.75 each way for both of us. And we stay in TriBeCa and walk to midtown, trying to take different routes each time. Pre-COVID we spent most of our money at theatres, opera, symphonic, and dance events and restaurants. And though we continue to maintain our memberships at museums, we currently only attend \"virtual\" presentations.\\nCH 1. I usually spend the most on Broadway/off Broadway shows. I go to as many as I can - if I am in NYC for 5 nights then I try to go to at least 8 shows. Some shows are high priced, others are discounted. I follow the ticket situation pretty closely so I know when I want to splurge and when to wait for last minute discounts. If I\\'m going to several big ticket shows then I try to go discount on a few to make up for it. I will also catch the occasional hockey game and will pay for a good seat.\\n2. Hotels - in a city like NYC I usually stay in a 3-4 star hotel - nothing fancy but not too cheap either.\\n3. Drinks - I don\\'t drink much at home but when I travel I do have a few cocktails most days. Definitely miss Ayza wine bar.\\n4. Food - definitely not a foodie - I often go to casual or pub style restaurants, frequently I do end up around the theater district since I\\'m seeing so many shows there\\n5. Random other things - occasional museum or special event. Buy a 7 day metro card. Rarely do I take a taxi. Occasional clothing shopping.\\nSince I haven\\'t been to NYC since January, my bank account is definitely happier :) Thanks for the interesting topic! I am a total bargain hunter, not because I have to, but because it is part of the fun.\\nHotels- I stalk sales, opening deals, upgrade options. I rarely pay more than $200 a night, and often end up with incredible rooms.\\nDining - I am a total non-foodie and I love ethnic food. Rarely sit down for breakfast, but if I do it is diner French Toast, that I love Lunch is always on the go, very happy with Pain Quotidien or Pret type options. Dinner I am likely to be looking for a curry or some dumplings.\\nDrinks - here I might splurge for a cocktail with atmosphere. Campbell Apartments, The Met rooftop, 230 Fifth etc. Maybe a stop in a pub for a pint of something vaguely Irish along the way. But I would not sit in a bar all night.\\nMuseums are definitely the spend for me, both for special exhibitions and the gift stores. I get lots of Christmas gifts in those.\\nShopping - very minimal, and basically things I cannot get at home. Uniqlo always for Heat tech, Trader Joe\\'s for a few food items I love. BUt otherwise nothing much.\\nI use transit very little, my deal is really walking, and running, the city. Your spending style is exactly the same as mine, maxi. I am the same as Maxi & Aynot with the addition of hitting up the merch table at shows & buying smaller books associated with the exhibits I saw at museums. The larger books go on my Christmas or birthday lists. I have found Priceline and Hotwire to be helpful in finding discounts at 3 and 4 star hotels. For my latest trip, booking a hotel through Southwest Airlines website got me a room at the Hyatt Place Midtown South (a couple of blocks from Macy\\'s, just off 6 Av.) for $103 per night (plus tax, but no resort fee) AND 7,000 bonus Southwest points. There are comparable deals available right now, probably because the hotels are hurting so bad. If you are planning a trip and you are a Rapid Rewards member, this is worth looking into.\\nAlso, if you are both old and cheap, or disabled and cheap, you can get an MTA Reduced Fare MetroCard that you can use on the subway and local buses all the time. At least a couple of months before your trip, download an application and send it to the MTA (along with a picture). There is no application fee. In about 6 weeks you will get your Reduced Fare MetroCard in the mail. Bring it with you, and when you arrive in NYC, load up your pay-per-ride or unlimited ride value onto your card at any ticket vending machine like you were refilling a regular MetroCard (except that you will be getting the reduced-fare amount on your card). I did this about 3 years ago, and have used this card ever since. When I arrive in New York City, I go to a ticket vending machine at the airport and add the 7-day unlimited reduced fare in the amount of $16.50 to my card. The MTA automatically sends a renewal card before the expiration date if you have used the card within the past year. You can also apply for this card at the MTA office on Stone St. in the Financial District, but it seems more convenient to get it by mail in advance and be able to use it immediately upon arrival. At this time, the Stone St. office is open by appointment only.\\nhttps://new.mta.info/fares/reduced-fare Hey guys, hope you are well.\\nSo me and my brother are looking to travel to NY for the first time and were wondering which hotels allow for under 21 check-ins?\\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated, added bonus if it is a Hyatt hotel as we get employee discount due to our relative.\\nThanks for your time :) 18+ hotel list https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12592934-What_are_Age_18_hotels_and_hostels_in_Manhattan_and_LIC-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nDue to the pandemic, some hotels may have gone out of business or not yet reopened - so verify the current status & policies of anyplace that interests you\\nIf your relative works for Hyatt you should ask them too.\\nUnless you are American citizens non-essential travel is still not allowed at this time. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html It is unclear when it might resume\\nI wouldn\\'t make any bookings that are not fully refundable *upon your request* (not at the option of the vendor) Thank you for your message and the list provided!\\nI thought that travel was allowed for people who were not on the banned country list and had a negative antigen test upon entry. I also got my ESTA approved. Is there anything else I need to be aware of?\\nThank you for your time. Your profile lists the UK as your residence - if you are elsewhere things may be different\\nRead this to see if you might be permitted to travel https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/faq?focusedTopic=United%20Kingdom%20and%20Ireland%20Travel%20Proclamations\\nEdited: 5:49 am, July 28, 2021 My profile is correct but I have been in Pakistan(Due to personal family reasons) for the last month, which is not restricted by the US yet for travel.\\nBut thank you for letting me know, I\\'ll surely have a read. Is there anything else I need to know if I am travelling for tourism purposes? My understanding is that you need to make sure any US bound flights do not connect through currently prohibited countries (you should verify this)\\nIf you are vaccinated for covid bring proof, be prepared to wear masks and be aware of the current NY covid rules https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home\\nYou\\'re not old enough to drink alcohol but that should not be a big deal (some entertainment venues may be 21+ only but you can still find plenty of fun things to do)\\nMany tourist attractions now require timed tickets. Review your sightseeing wish list to see which do as you plan .\\nMost hotels require a security deposit for damage or incidentals. If you do not have a credit card verify the policies of the hotel you choose. (Generally it is not a good idea to use a debit card - a \"hold\"is placed on the amount of the deposit so you cannot access that money during your stay. Some hotels will accept cash deposits)\\nI\\'d also review the covid travel rules for your return home to London (or wherever) Hey, thank you very much for your message and advice again!\\nI have confirmed that my connecting flight is not from a prohibited country, its from Qatar.\\nAlso thank you for letting me know about the timed tickets and hotel deposits!\\nAnd yes I have already made plans for my travel back to London :) Aloha! We’ll be in NYC for 3 nights and 4 days. I’m trying to decipher the difference,\\nPros and cons between the MetroCard and OMNY card. We’re planning trips to Fordham University, Citi Field, Hudson Yards and 9/11 Museum. Can someone explain the difference and recommend which one would be better for us? Thee is no OMNY card. To utilize the OMNY platform, you utilize a debit/credit/smart device/etc.\\nI would recommend whichever you feel more comfortable with. If you don\\'t mind pulling out your bank, CC, device each time you want to enter the system, do that.\\nIf you want to purchase a Metrocard and use that to gain access....and have a nice souvenir after you leave, do that.\\nSame price. Where you are traveling to/from really doesn\\'t matter. If you\\'re going to Fordham (I assume the Bronx campus) you\\'re better off taking Metro North from Grand Central direct to the campus rather than taking the subway and then either transferring to a bus or having a fairly long walk. Can\\'t use a Metrocard on Metro North commuter trains. The current half-fare senior cards issued by the MTA will be converted to OMNY cards in the future. At present, OMNY charges the full fare only. The OMNY system is not fully implemented and at present only does the full fare pay-per ride @$2.75/ride (no unlimited passes or other special/reduced fares at this time) https://omny.info/faq/how-omny-works You do get the free transfers and can pay fares for up to four with the same card/device (same as with a Metrocard)\\nThe full roll out will not be complete until 2023\\nIt is my understanding that towards the end of the implementation a dedicated tap card that can be purchased and refilled with cash will be made available for the unbanked & the Luddites. P.S. Depending on how many rides you will be making the weekly unlimited can be your best value https://new.mta.info/fares\\n$33 + $1 for the physical card (separate card for each fare paying passenger) = break even 13+ rides\\nPlus you don\\'t have to worry about the balance on the card, spend any time refilling your cards and can feel free to take very short rides with no concern about extra fare costs\\nEdited: 8:23 am, July 27, 2021 I think the key difference for you is as Kaye laid out…the current lack of an unlimited ride option with OMNY. That may or may not be an issue for you on a relatively short trip, though even on a short trip, it’s easy to rack up a lot of bus and subway rides.\\nFWIW, I’m a bit of a Luddite but have now fully transitioned to OMNY. I’ve been biking more & using the subway less, so the unlimited ride option no longer benefits me, and I like the tap-and-go convenience and not needing to worry about reloading my card. My spouse, who (ahem!) qualifies for 1/2 price fares still uses his Metrocard. Assuming you intend to visit the Rose Hill Fordham campus, I\\'d be inclined to advise you use the Metro North one way and the subway the other so the prospective student (?) can get a feel for the adjacent area https://www.fordham.edu/info/20962/maps_and_directions/4657/directions_to_rose_hill\\n#6 Linda, I\\'m a bit of a Luddite and have vintage 80\\'s New Yorker habits regarding my personal possessions. I keep my phone and wallet securely zipped inside my purse and my Metrocard in an outside pocket for easy access. Removing and replacing something inside my purse would not save me time. I would not feel comfortable keeping a credit/debit card in an exterior pocket. How have you approached this issue? Kaye (and security-minded visitors): I think that as a more recent arrival I’m less security-minded than you. (Or at least differently-security-minded; I’m still more alert to the dangers of being jumped than of having my pocket picked, old habits die hard.) So I’m comfortable keeping my credit card in a pocket - which these days, when I’m typically wearing athletic gear or dorky cargo shorts, often means a zipped and/or hard-to-access pocket. On those rare occasions when I’m carrying a purse, I keep it in an interior pocket and take it out as I approach the station/stop.\\nHonestly, in some ways I’m less worried about losing my credit card - which is protected and can be canceled - than a Metrocard loaded with $20-$30, which if it’s lost, is lost.\\nI’m way too much of a Luddite to use smartphone pay apps. For foreigners an issue is a possible foreign currency transaction fee each time they use OMNY. It’s cheaper to load a Metrocard in one transaction. Hi All,\\nThanks for all the helpful information. It helps me understand the differences between the MetroCard and OMNY payment systems. We won’t have a car while in Manhattan so the possibility of unlimited Metro rides are enticing (even to just ride it a few stops).\\nThanks also for the suggestions on the Fordham Rosehill transportation ideas. We’ll definitely look into it. Hi! I have followed this forum for YEARS but am just now posting (after searching many past posts)\\n.\\nMy daughter and I are planning to visit the NYC area to tour some colleges. One of the colleges we are looking at is Pace University, so I thought staying near there in the financial district might be nice.\\nOur travel dates are July 28-31, one bed of any size is fine and I would like to stay around $500 total for all three nights. I know that is a very low budget, thus, my post for tips.\\nWe have previously stayed at the Embassy Suites near Bryant Park (which we really liked), the Hampton Inn near the Port Authority (which was totally fine and we found The Mercato, our favorite restaurant), a Days Inn in Hell\\'s Kitchen (acceptable because it was all we could afford at Christmas time), and we even stayed in Secaucus once (wouldn\\'t recommend, but again - it was what we could afford and I booked very late)\\nSome hotels I\\'m currently considering are the Artezen (a bit above my budget, but may be possible), the Hampton Inn Financial District, and Aloft financial district.\\nAny advice or suggestions are very welcome! Thank You! Take a look at the Hampton inn on Pearl St, with taxes it may take you just over your budget. Doing a hotel search on TripAdvisor, the Fairfield Inn Downtown/ World Trade Center and the Hilton Garden Inn Financial Center both fit the budget for king rooms on Booking.com. The Artezen is nicest and closest to Pace but slightly over budget. The Fairfield inn includes breakfast if that helps the budget and is not that much further. Do you want breakfast included as well? Out of the three you mention, I like the location of Artezen and Aloft. Both are near the Fulton Street subway hub (many many lines to get you anywhere else you need to be to sightsee apart from visiting Pace). Plus, very walkable to TriBeCa where there are many great restaurants. I’d highly recommend The Artezen. I stayed in the FiDi for the first time in April and stayed there. I had missed NYC greatly and enjoyed my stay at The Artezen so much that I booked another stay in May. I am returning again next week with my daughter and her fiancé. The rooms are nicely decorated, spotless, customer service top, location perfect and the rates are great for NYC. My first visit I stayed in the queen deluxe which was quite roomy for NYC. The 2nd visit I booked a petite queen to save some money. I booked a deluxe queen for my return. If you book the queen deluxe room there is a 15% discount for 3 nights or more bookings and an additional $5 per night off using promo code DIRECT. The total would be $599.43. A tad over your budget of $500. The king deluxe would be $627..18.\\nEdited: 6:23 am, July 16, 2021 We have stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn and will be there on Sunday night. It is a nice hotel Wow. Thank you so much for the responses and suggestions, everyone! I think we\\'re going to go with the Artezen. I love the location - that it\\'s close to many subway lines as well as Pace. And I appreciated the confirmation that it is a nice place. We don\\'t mind at all that there is no breakfast - we\\'ll be quite happy grabbing a bagel somewhere on the go. For the best bagels in the area (and usually on the top bagels in the city lists), go to Leo\\'s Bagels: https://leosbagels.com/\\nFor a good avocado toast and other French breakfast specialties, go to La Parisienne (which is super close to the Artezen): https://www.laparisiennenyc.com/?utm_source=GBL&utm_medium=GBL&utm_campaign=FP&utm_term=GBL&utm_content=GBL Thanks for the breakfast tip - just added it to our itinerary! I just finished a similar search for mid-November. Several Hilton and Marriott properties at the very tip of the island were downright cheap, further north around WTC was a $100 or so over your budget. I ended up at the Solita Soho for $549. Very cool and creative! I may check it out this wknd if I am around those parts.....\\n-Citrovia is located at One Manhattan West Plaza, on Ninth Avenue between 31st and 32nd streets, and is free and open to the public daily from 6 a.m. to 1 a.m.\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos-fantastical-lemon-wonderland-grows-under-some-scaffolding-ninth-avenue That looks like something Willy Wonka would enjoy! 😊 I stopped by today when I was in the area. It’s a block down from B&H. It’s really charming, with tables and chairs and the fantastical foliage and fruit. Unfortunately next to a very noisy construction site. Don’t forget to look up as the ceiling does strange things. I was there today too! https://www.facebook.com/susan.katz.92/posts/10159317425432236?notif_id=1626903379865060¬if_t=feedback_reaction_generic&ref=notif Thanks for sharing this. I\\'m adding to me \"to see\" list! Architectural Digest has a nice rundown on the development of Citrovia:\\nhttps://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/citrovia-real-estate-manhattan-west I was able to check this out this past Sunday.\\nI was actually headed to B&H for a new lens for my camera and remembered that the lemon spot was a few blocks away. I walked up to 10th Ave but didn\\'t see anything and realized that it was on 9th.\\nIt was a little smaller than I expected, but still very cool. It\\'s basically a block over from the main Hudson Yards entrance.\\nI saw people sitting and eating and just enjoying the display. I didn\\'t smell any lemon scent, but only stayed for 3-4 minutes.\\nIt is still a cool attraction to check out if you are down in that area. Very easy to pair with the Vessel and then grabbing something to eat and trying to find a seat. **Don’t forget to look up as the ceiling does strange things.**\\nI forgot! I was just about to say the same as #1. It is very clever. I accidentally walked past this and it is actually pretty impressive in real life. I am planning on visiting a friend down in Brooklyn this weekend and was wondering if it’s safe for a solo female to travel from Mt Vernon all the way down via public (Metro N then take subway down to The Battery). I will probably walk to Mt Vernon East to access the train. Are these safe areas? I am newer to the Mt Vernon Very safe.\\nWhat does your friend from the area say?\\nYou do know the Battery isn’t Brooklyn, right?\\nEdited: 6:32 am, July 27, 2021 Yes my apologies we are meeting at the battery then going over to Brooklyn together I ride the Metro North at least twice a week. I see solo adult females, solo teens, etc riding the train every time I am on.\\nThe trip down from Grand Central to Battery Park is also straightforward and safe. I’m a solo female. I go everywhere alone - Amtrak, metro north, planes, trains, and automobiles. I wouldn’t think twice about metro north or a subway ride down the length of Manhattan, of all the things I’ve done, that wouldn’t even register as something to give a second thought. Mt. Vernon has some not great areas. I’d only worry about wherever you are getting to the train station. Ask a neighbor. I work in northern Yonkers from time to time. About two months ago, I did get lost in Mount Vernon at night. Some parts are bad. https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/nyc-enlists-clive-davis-mega-concert-central-park-part-homecoming-week\\nGreat idea and will be a part of Homecoming Week in NYC!

I have not booked a hotel yet as I am hoping for some suggestions, although, from all the research I have done so far, I think Midtown is where I want to stay for out 2-nights. We will be flying in from AZ arriving early in the morning of 8/7/2021 and then we are being picked up around noon on 8/9/2021 at Orient Point Station ( I have no idea where this is in relation to everything but have found a link telling me how to get there.\\nI am not really a shopper or a foodie but we do like good food and cocktails. Suggestions of fun and somewhat reasonably priced happy hour or dining options with rooftop or great view city views would be appreciated, I have read about some and made notes, but would appreciate feedback that is not \"advertisement\". Also, since it is a stopover on another trip I will have nice clothes but am not packing any formal attire.\\nAlso, I would much rather explore and see more due to my limited timeframe than see a show or go shopping and cannot really afford the time to visit places that have extraordinarily long entry lines. I love history old architecture, city lights, and really want to see Central Park and Brooklyn Bridge. We enjoy walking and expect to utilize public transportation, I have seen some suggestions of taking a water taxi to see the statue of liberty from the water, any thoughts on this idea?\\nFor the hotel, the room is not where we plan on spending our time, but we would like it to be safe & clean, wifi, air conditioning, located within walking distance to public transportation, and bonuses would be fun/social bar, an in-room fridge is always helpful, and either historic setting or ultra-contemporary... trying to avoid run of the mill. I am hoping to keep it under $500 per night, I am not sure if that is doable or not. Parking is not a factor since we will be walking and/or using public transportation.\\nLastly, does it matter if we fly into JFK or LaGuardia Airport? I have also seen EWR Newark Liberty Airport as an option?? Sorry, this is so long, but it seems like when people try to help and provide answers, they often need more information than the person posting has provided. Thank you very much for any information you can share.\\nEdited: 7:05 pm, July 16, 2021 Orient Point Station makes no sense, thats the end of Long Island about 90 Miles from NYC.\\nYou dont need to take a water taxi to See the statue of Libert, Libery Cruise lines goes there (and Ellis Island)\\nIf you have a direct flight from Arizona, you would be going to Newark or JFK, LGA is only for shorter flights Isn\\'t Greenport the last station on that LIRR branch? http://web.mta.info/lirr/Timetable/lirrmap.htm Yes, Oritent Point is about 10 Miles Past Greenpoint\\nFor 2 Days Id recommend the following\\nStart at Times Sqaure then walk to Rockefeller Center. Go to Top of the rock and see the view of NYC . The walk up Fifth Ave to Central Park\\nDay 2 Take Subway Downtown to South ferry and walk to South Street Seaport area and See the Brooklyn Bridge , then walk back to South Ferry and take the Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty. The take Subway to 14th and 8t Ave and walk to the High Line and Walk the High Line to 34th St. The Vessel is near here so go see the Vessel While I am not the hotel expert, The Marriott Marquis is in the heart of Times Square. I think it will meet your budget easy Thank you! That is good to know, I had no idea that the Orient Point Station was that far away, but that is where I have to be at noon on the 9th to meet with the rest of our travel group.

Or just take the subway back and forth? The Brooklyn side is easily accessible by subway, as is the Manhattan side. Many people opt to take the subway to Brooklyn and walk across towards Manhattan for the best skyline view during the walk (although I saw some nutjobs walking towards Brooklyn but climbing up and sitting on top of the railing to catch great photos on Wednesday evening. That is really stupid. Don\\'t do that!). There are things to see and do all over the city, there are benefits to both midtown and downtown...right now, a lot of people are complaining that midtown feels empty, as offices haven\\'t returned to business as usual yet.\\n2. \"We will be flying in from AZ arriving early in the morning of 8/7/2021 and then we are being picked up around noon on 8/9/2021 at Orient Point Station ( I have no idea where this is in relation to everything but have found a link telling me how to get there.\" You should check LIRR schedules and make sure you leave yourself plenty of time to uber or other transportation from the last LIRR stop at Greenport.\\n3. \"Suggestions of fun and somewhat reasonably priced happy hour or dining options with rooftop or great view city views would be appreciated, I have read about some and made notes, but would appreciate feedback that is not \"advertisement\".

Or check out Bar 13 for happy hour drink specials, music, and \"bar bites\". http://www.bar13nyc.com/ The nice part of that rooftop is that it is right near Washington Square Park - no trip to NYC should be deemed complete without a little bit of exposure to WSP, which is in Greenwich Village, one of the liveliest areas of Manhattan. Formal cloths are NOT necessary anywhere except in very few places - you won\\'t be going to them on this trip, it sounds like!\\n4. \"I love history old architecture, city lights, and really want to see Central Park and Brooklyn Bridge.

Very worthwhile to see what someone else just did.)\\n5. \"I am hoping to keep it under $500 per night, I am not sure if that is doable or not. Parking is not a factor since we will be walking and/or using public transportation.\" That shouldn\\'t be a problem, but will leave it to the hotel experts.\\n6. \"Lastly, does it matter if we fly into JFK or LaGuardia Airport? I have also seen EWR Newark Liberty Airport as an option??\" Search all three airports and take the flight that fits into your time requirements and budget. LGA is the closest and cheapest cab fare (if that\\'s how you\\'re planning to travel). JFK cab fare with tip, tolls and extras comes in under $75, Newark is within $10 of that, usually. I normally make 5-6 trips to NYC per year for theater marathons (or half marathons). For obvious reasons I hadn\\'t been to the city since January 2020. I hadn\\'t planned to visit until late October when there will be a bunch of shows, but when Springsteen on Broadway announced a return, I couldn\\'t resist a long weekend in the city. I tried, I really did :)\\nThe remainder of the time was spent re-visiting some of my favorite places and just hanging out. I was a little anxious about it since I have avoided crowds of people for so long, but it turned out well. A warning - I get very wordy and I am the opposite of a foodie. Day 1 (Friday) -\\nI decided on this trip less than a month ago, so I didn\\'t get a great deal on the hotel (I usually reserve far in advance and keep checking rates periodically). I wasn\\'t sure how I would feel about taking the subway after the show so I wanted to stay walking distance to the theater (around 44th and 8th). I usually stay in Marriott or Hilton hotels. I read reviews of a couple of places in the Hilton family that weren\\'t storing luggage if you check in early, which was a deal breaker for me since I was arriving at 11 am.\\nI ended up at the Moxy Times Square. I do stay in the west 20\\'s/30\\'s near Penn Station on occasion but it isn\\'t my preference. I also prefer 7th Avenue to 8th Avenue so this was a decent compromise. The rooms are very small which was fine since I was on my own. I did miss having a desk to put things on but that was a minor quibble. The day before I arrived I received an email stating that masks were required by guests and staff in public areas. This surprised me but I was happy with it. However, only about 20% of guests actually wore masks. The hotel was probably the place that had the lowest mask use that I visited. I find it irritating when businesses make a point of informing you of their policies then they don\\'t follow/enforce them. If you aren\\'t going to enforce it - then just say masks are optional. The biggest issue I had with the hotel was the thumpa thumpa music from the rooftop club. The first night I listened to it until around 1:45 am, the next 2 nights I must have been more tired and ended up dozing off within 30 minutes of listening to it. I have a reservation for Moxy East Village in January but I\\'m starting to think I should change my reservation. I don\\'t think I\\'m cool enough for them. We\\'ll see.\\nI was lucky that I was able to check in early so after a quick refresh I headed out for a walk. I enjoy city parks so I walked up to Bryant Park and spent a few hours just relaxing and people watching. I had a snack and glass of wine at Fever-Tree Porch which was a nice setting. My favorite drink in NYC is the almond martini at Ayza Wine Bar. They currently open at 4 pm so I walked down to Ayza on 31st to enjoy their patio. Things are a little different there now - when sitting outside you go up to the entrance to the restaurant to place your order. The almond martini didn\\'t disappoint nor did the food.\\nAfter Ayza I walked back to the hotel and just enjoyed the air conditioning for about 45 minutes. Then it was time to get freshened up and head back to a theater for the first time in 18 months. Walking to the theater the sidewalks in lower Times Square were semi-busy but nothing like pre-covid. Springsteen required proof of vaccination (with a few exceptions then testing/masking). If it weren\\'t for the vaccination requirement, I would not have made this trip. When he walked out on stage and the audience started to applause and stand, it made me really emotional. I actually started to tear up a bit - didn\\'t anticipate that. Later in the show when he spoke of his parents, the tears fell for real (glad I left my mask on to soak up the tears). I\\'m more of a casual fan than a die-hard but I thought it was a wonderful show and worth the $$$. I found it even more memorable than when I saw it a few years ago.\\nWhen I emerged from the theater it was pouring rain. I headed over to 9th Avenue to grab a drink/snack and the first open place was Playwright Tavern. After about 80 minutes the rain stopped so I walked back to the hotel. As I walked I remembered that I was supposed to be scared to walk the streets of the city these days. I did keep my phone in my bag and tried to be aware of my surroundings (like I always should) but I felt completely comfortable. It was then time for sleep - at least once the rooftop club music stopped hours later. Day 2 (Saturday)\\nEvery trip I try to spend at least an hour or two in Central Park. I took the subway up to 72nd street, then walked toward the Boathouse, passing Strawberry Fields and Bethesda Terrace and Fountain. I\\'ve never eaten at the Boathouse but it looked like there were lots of open tables so I decided to go in for brunch. It was disappointing to be given a table in the third row when everyone else was in the front but still a great view. I thought the food was yummy and it was a nice stop.\\nI then headed out to explore some more - seeing Alice in Wonderland, Conservatory Water, around part of the Reservoir, to The Pool, The Loch, Central Park Waterfall, Lasker Rink and finally the Harlem Meer. I have visited a lot of the park but had never seen the Pool/waterfall before so I enjoyed seeing something different. I sat on a bench for a while deciding where I wanted to head next.\\nI really wanted some shade and a cold drink so took the subway from 110th down to 72nd. I ended up at Pomodoro on Columbus Ave. at a nice shady outdoor table. I spent way longer here than I intended - there was a mix up with my order so I didn\\'t get my food for over an hour but to be honest I didn\\'t mind. I was enjoying sipping on a glass of wine, watching the world go by and chatting with a couple of locals. While i have walked this area several times in the past, I was speechless when I was asked if I thought it was better to live on 62nd or 67th. They both seem nice to me!\\nI had planned to walk back through the Mall and the Pond and then catch the subway from there. However, I spent too long just relaxing so that I had to change my plans. My niece, nephew and his girlfriend were riding their bikes on the Empire State Trail from Buffalo to Battery Park. My sister and her husband were the \"support crew\" in their RV. I got a text that the kids (who are really adults in their mid 20s) were in Yonkers. I started to worry that I didn\\'t have enough time to walk the park and I really didn\\'t want to miss their big finish. I took the subway back to the hotel for a quick refresh and change of clothes, then back on the subway to Battery Park. The latest update was the I was in good shape but the support crew had some delays and were likely to miss the finish (they were staying at a park in Jersey City). After about an hour I was surprised to look up and see the kids. It was really cool to see them accomplish their goal of biking 538 miles in 5 days. We hung out for a while looking out at the Statue Of Liberty waiting for their parents to catch up. They enjoyed some ice cream and then they were starting to flag a bit. We walked up to the Oculus so they could catch the PATH train to their RV and I jumped on the subway. When I came out of the subway it was raining again so ducked into the Pig n Whistle near the hotel for a quick night cap then time for sleep. Day 3 (Sunday)\\nIt was a lazy morning - checked my phone and it was raining, so I took my time this morning and I got a late start. I read on here about a mural in Chinatown (thanks to whoever posted that) so headed down on the subway. Unfortunately it was hard to see the whole mural due to all of the dining tables on it but still cool to see. My plan was to walk to the West/Greenwich Village for lunch but I was hungry so decided not to wait. Walking by Mulberry Street I thought the outdoor dining in this area was very cute so I decided to eat at Gelso & Grand. I know Little Italy takes a beating on this forum but I enjoyed the pizza and the setting (though I did think the pizza was over priced).\\nI headed out again to Washington Square Park. I love to sit in the park and listen to the buskers. It was quite busy but there were still some open benches to soak up the atmosphere. The Greenwich/West Village is my favorite area and I really wanted to just stroll the streets, stop at sidewalk cafes, parks, etc. but I had a reservation for Little Island at 2:30. I debated skipping my reservation but I decided to stick to the original plan.\\nI walked through part of the Village to get to the new park, Little Island. While the park was pretty enough, I just wasn\\'t feeling it (maybe because my heart wasn\\'t really in it). I walked up to the Lookout which offered nice views and one of the only spots with a nice breeze so it was popular. As I walked down from the Lookout a show at the amph let out and I was caught in a stampede of kids, parents and grandparents headed for the Lookout (I actually slipped my mask on because I was being over run with people!). I spent about 45 minutes here and had enough.\\nI had planned to hit up the Brass Monkey after but their downstairs was packed and crazy with Euro Cup watchers, so I kept walking. I headed up 9th Avenue looking for a shady seat at a restaurant/bar that wasn\\'t so busy that they would mind if I didn\\'t order food. I ended up around 22nd sweet at a Mexian restaurant, Fonda. I sat in their \"hut\" on the street which had fans to keep you cool. I had a couple of tasty margaritas and a some tortilla chips and again really enjoyed just relaxing and people watching. There were plenty of extra tables so they didn\\'t seem to mind that I was lingering.\\nI then walked over to Chelsea Piers and sat on a bench looking out at the Hudson. At 6:30 I checked in for my sunset cruise on the Yacht Manhattan. I\\'ve never done a sunset cruise because I\\'m usually at a show. I thought this was really well done. They are following covid protocols and I was really impressed with the lengths they went. Each party was assigned a table inside and they had plexiglass separating the tables/parties. The ticket comes with a drink and then the bar tender bought another round, so it was 2 glasses of prosecco (didn\\'t plan on that). The weather was prefect for the cruise even though the sunset was not the most spectacular. We went down to the SOL then turned around and came back a little above Chelsea Piers when we headed back to the dock. Don\\'t forget to tip!\\nI walked over to 10th Avenue and had dinner at a nice outdoor spot at Pepe Giallo. Good pasta but had to turn down the wine since I\\'d had enough on the boat! I debated walking back to the hotel but I was tired and when I got to 8th Avenue it looked like the train was coming soon so I hopped on the train for one whole stop! Quick walk back to the hotel and time to pack up for a 6;15 am check out and the short walk to the new Moynihan Train Hall.\\nIn summary - NYC is still great, I felt fine on the subways, be aware of your surroundings but go and enjoy the city! One other note on the subways - some trains had about 90% mask usage but I was on two that had several groups of 5-6 young adults that thought they were above the masking rules. Brilliant trip report - thank you My daughter and I are due to visit from UK in December??\\nOur 12th annual trip with of course none last year .\\nWashington Park is one place we have never been so was interested to hear about the buskers. Thanks for the report george00. I enjoyed it very much. All the details were interesting. Specially loved the details of Central Park, Washington Square Park/ The Village, your considering what you might do and what you did do, finding a shady table ect… A Visual read.\\nYour writing really makes me want to visit even more. I’ll be there at end of August early September. What a great trip. So glad you shared your Trip Report. Springsteen on Broadway? Clearly appealing to this Bruce fan ;) Lots of fun! And I\\'m super impressed (and a tad envious) with your tolerance levels. Wine then a martini? Margaritas and prosecco? I would be laid out flat on a gurney! Good for you ! What a way to watch the world go by!\\nAnd yes, Bruce. I haven\\'t seen the new version yet. Can\\'t wait! Thanks for the comments.\\nRisa- Haha. I actually don\\'t have great tolerance - I rarely drink alcohol at home and if I do, one glass of wine and I\\'m asleep. When I\\'m in the city though I do make up for it :) My secrets are to drink slowly, drink lots of water and nibble on something too! I have learned not to have a drink before a play, otherwise I\\'m asleep when the lights go down. I knew I wouldn\\'t fall asleep on Bruce though! Thanks for a wonderful trip report! Thank you for allowing us to tag along on your trip. Sounds wonderful.\\n...” It was disappointing to be given a table in the third row when everyone else was in the front but still a great view..”\\nNext time ask for a different table. Since they don\\'t take reservations for brunch, they couldn\\'t have said it was taken.😉 We arrived yesterday and spent the sunset to dark hours at Domino Park. It was my second visit, first was in the spring, and my daughter’s first. Families, couples, friends, even pooches were out enjoying this perfect spot on the waterfront. The sunset views of the Manhattan skyline (including the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings) and the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges made for a stunning scene. (There was a bit of haze due to the wildfires). As the sun disappeared and the darkness approached, the lights on the bridges and in the buildings lit up the skyline. Ferrying back from N. Williamsburg to Pier11/Wall Street on the dark, moonlit river with city lights that looked like twinkling stars in the sky was the perfect end to our first day. Moments like this make us realize how darn lucky you New Yorkers! Yes, I loved it too even though it was a freezing November day a couple of years ago when it was still very new and undiscovered. Hardly anybody was there but that was fine with me.\\nQuestion about Tacocina...was it open? When I was there it was manned by one sole staffer with no customers around at all. I guess tacos and margarita\\'s out on a freezing cold terrace isn\\'t exactly appealing in November. I can imagine summer would be very enticing though. Glad to hear you had a great time! Domino Park and nearby Brooklyn Bridge Park are some of my favorites for enjoying a good sunset. 1 AUGUST -\\nHarlem Gospel Walking Tour:\\nHarlem Gospel Walking Tour visits one of Harlem’s most historic churches consisting of soul stirring gospel music and the power of prayer, followed with a multimedia cultural Harlem sightseeing walking tour conveying the overall history of Harlem with emphasis on contribution churches and religious organizations make to Harlem regularly - more than just wonderful gospel music.\\nhttps://www.harlemheritage.com/tour/harlem-gospel-walking-tour-3-2019-06-30-2019-07-21/2021-08-01/\\n--\\n2 AUGUST -\\nGeneral Harlem History Walking Tour:\\nGeneral Harlem History Walking Tour will be accompanied with portable pictures, video and sound along the way, imagine walking the streets listening to Billie Holiday at the club where she once sang or watching video of Malcolm X at the very spot where he delivered speech in 1963 – we bring the history to life.\\nhttps://www.harlemheritage.com/tour/general-harlem-history-walking-tour-2-2017-06-26/2021-08-02/\\n--\\n5 AUGUST -\\nEast Harlem Farmers Market:\\nhttps://local.aarp.org/event/east-harlem-farmers-market-2021-08-05-new-york-ny.html\\n--\\n6 AUGUST -\\n\"The Early Set\" at Room 623, Harlem\\'s speakeasy:\\n\"The Early Set\" offers a high energy, spontaneous \"Jazz party\" vibe with top notch musicians from around the world and around the corner!\\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-early-set-at-room-623-harlems-speakeasy-tickets-117799137391\\n--\\n6 AUGUST -\\nHarlem Hospital Market:\\nhttps://local.aarp.org/event/harlem-hospital-market-2021-08-06-new-york-ny.html\\n--\\n7 AUGUST -\\nHarlem Hafla:\\nHarlem Hafla is a day of M.E.N.A.

Since the COVID outbreak: during 2020, approximately 12 Manhattan hotels permanently closed, and approximately 19 other hotels have not set a date to reopen.\\n2. Approximately 109 Manhattan hotels closed, then reopened, between April 1, 2020--February 16, 2021.\\n2. Approximately 11 Manhattan hotels are scheduled to reopen between February 17, 2021 and March 31, 2021.\\n3. Approximately 52 Manhattan hotels are now tentatively scheduled to re-open in April 2021; expect this figure to drop, perhaps considerably. Approximately 25 more Manhattan hotels are tentatively scheduled to re-open during the remainder of 2021.\\n4. For new Manhattan hotels, expect approximately 9 to open during the first 3 quarters of 2021. Approximately two dozen additional new hotels had been tentatively scheduled to open during 2021. This number will be substantially reduced; some may not open in 2021, or at all.\\nComments:\\nHotels have re-opening or will re-open slowly, especially during the 5 months from November 2020-March 2021.\\nMany hotels have delayed re-opening dates, often more than once.\\nCurrently, 31 Manhattan hotels have closed, either permanently or without-announced dates yet to reopen. Expect this number to increase, perhaps considerably, during 2021.\\nWith careful research, highly-competitive rates are available. This is especially true for stays longer than one week with a substantial or non-refundable deposit; such opportunities should be explored with the Director of Sales or Revenue Manager of a particular hotel. Following historical trends, rates overall should be especially favorable in January-February 2022.\\nFor visitors, the use of the above is qualified by any travel restrictions, COVID conditions and personal choices at the time of planned travel.\\nEdited: 6:47 pm, February 17, 2021 LittleBiffOne, do you have a list of the 12 hotels that have closed permanently and the 19 that haven\\'t set an opening date?\\nAnd do you know the names of the new hotels that are due to open this year?\\nYour interest in hotels and statistics is really interesting.

Aynat: You’re welcome.\\nIn addition to visitors, there are a number of implications for hotel investors, hotel managers and NYC tourism.\\nEdited: 4:46 pm, February 19, 2021 Also closed is the AKA hotel that I believe is known as the AKA United Nations, or something similar, on E 46th. I happened to be walking by the other day and was annoyed to find they hadn\\'t shoveled the snow off their sidewalk. Then I looked and realized the place was dark, with the front doors chained shut. Another place in that area that remains closed, don\\'t know about scheduled reopening, is the Lexington, at Lex & 48th, an Autograph Collection hotel. That stretch of Lex in hi 40s has gotten sort of dark and creepy at night with so many big hotels closed. For months the Doubletree Metropolitan at Lex and 51st has looked about to reopen, but so far no sign of it. Think they may be taking advantage of this time to do some work on the hotel. Re: Posts 8 and 9\\nGrandrue, your comments are very helpful.\\nYou are correct that the AKA United Nations is permanently closed.\\nThe Lexington and Doubletree Metropolitan are tentatively scheduled to reopen April 1.\\nThus the Manhattan hotel totals are:\\n1. New hotels with opening dates, 2021: 10\\n(No change)\\n2. Permanently closed since COVID: 12 (+1)\\n3. Temporarily closed without date to re-open: 18 (no change)\\nThe hotels in Items 2 and 3 are similar in that they cannot be booked now.\\nEdited: 7:20 pm, February 19, 2021 The price of a tasting menu dinner will be $800 at Per Se and Masa.

They only got a measly $ 5 million. Oh, thanks for that. It seemed like an awful lot if money, for any business >\"will keep its regular nine-course menu at $355 per person\"\\nMy wife and I splurged when we took out her parents for their 40th anniversary. Nice place, right on the water. Threw care to the wind and ordered recklessly. Ate and drank well to our hearts content. One of the best times we\\'ve had out. For a week the two of them gushed on the phone to family, friends and anyone who would listen. With tax and tip it was $300 for all of us.\\nNaturally, to each their own, but spending $355 per person (I guess tax/tip ratchets that up to $470 pp. not sure if that includes booze) to me is so far out of my orbit that its more like a theoretical construct than anything that approaches reality. At the world famous Radio City Music Hall from November 2021, tickets are now on sale.\\nThis is a very festive and happy show for all ages. Kids will love the Christmas themes and Santa, and adults will love the high kicking Rockettes and their choreography.\\nhttps://www.rockettes.com/christmas/calendar/ However, many of us will recommend you wait until discounts are available as the space is huge. Unless you either are very particular about where you sit or want holiday weekend evening tickets, there will be discounts galore. I agree, but they\\'re on sale for those that are keen. I don\\'t know exactly what the language on Radio City website says, but I suggest anyone interested read it carefully. The NYC Ballet website is very careful to point out, regarding the Nutcracker, that it is CURRENTLY THEIR INTENT to present Nutcracker on such and such dates, with tickets on sale late Sept. The fact that performances have been scheduled and tickets sold is not a guarantee these days that the performance will actually take place. Yes, things are not progressing well with Covid-19, and wearing masks and other recommendations/restrictions may be forthcoming. I went down to the Jersey Shore Sat. and between the subway and train, it was 3 hrs. in a mask per regulation each way. However, when I arrived in Ocean Grove, no one was wearing a mask in town. Here is Flushing, everyone wears a mask and stores still require them for entry.\\nEdited: 10:07 am, July 26, 2021 This website has an image of the hall from the stage that gives a better impression of the interior than the seating chart.\\nhttps://www.cruiselinehistory.com/social-history-radio-city-music-hall/ Yes, Shakespeare in the Park recently resumed performances after 3 days of canceled performances following a crew member\\'s testing positive for COVID. Even if things don\\'t get horribly worse, just go along as now, I suspect that once Broadway reopens in Sept. we may see more of this -- i.,e., short-term shutdowns when someone connected with the show tests positive. Welcome to the new world unfortunately. Hi all,\\nWife and I are flying into JFK and probably exiting the airport after midnight. We will have 4 pieces of luggage and 2 carry on bags. What\\'s the most cost effective/convenient way to get from JFK to the Penn station area.\\nAirtrain plus LIRR is cheapest, but still out be hell getting out luggage on and off the trains? Do we have to worry about stairs?\\nWill a regular taxi be be able to handle our luggage?\\nHow much should I expect to pay if we spring for a private shuttle?\\nThanks in advance for any assistance. Taxi is fixed rate from JFK to anywhere in Manhattan. Expect to pay between $70 and $75 with tip/toll included:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page\\nObviously more expensive than taking mass transit, but based on your luggage and time of day, a taxi would be cost effective to me. There are elevators for the LIRR platforms if you know where to look. Be advised that the whole LIRR concourse at Penn Station is under reconstruction with all the shops removed. Whether this would affect elevators is uncertain. Getting from the LIRR concourse up to street level is another matter. There are new escalators and at least one elevator near 34th St. Use this map to locate things.\\nhttps://jasongibbs.com/pennstation/ Is there any possibility that you could reduce the amount of luggage? Ten pieces is far too many for two people to handle Taxi, but make sure it is from the OFFICIAL TAXI LINE ONLY.\\nIgnore anyone offering a chance to skip the line. Oops, I should have said in post 3 that 6 pieces of luggage -- 4 suitcases or trunks and 2 carry-ons is too much for 2 people to handle easily Whether a regular taxi can handle your luggage depends on the size of the taxi and the size of the luggage. There is no way I can see you managing your luggage on your own to use the train. The issue is not stairs but wheeling all that luggage between 2 people. You can try getting a quite from\\nCarmellini.com How are you getting to your originating airport? Are you able to take public transportation with all of that luggage? If you can\\'t do it on your start side, you certainly can\\'t do it upon landing in a strange place. I would absolutely take a taxi (I take a taxi if I have a suitcase large enough to be checked). I suspect you will be able to fit it all in, but one person may be riding in front with the driver. Be prepared with masks! Carmellimo.com\\nNote with Covid, not all car services will allow passengers in front with driver. Where are you coming from? Thanks for the advice all. Understand it will be difficult to wheel around luggage, unfortunately not much choice in the matter as we are moving countries and want to maximize our luggage.\\nSuspect we will take our chances with a taxi. ***Suspect we will take our chances with a taxi.***\\nNo chances, use the official taxi line and you\\'ll be fine. See the link I provided in post #1. Sit back and enjoy the ride. Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice please.\\nMyself and my girlfriend will be in NYC from 9th - 19th August. This is our first trip to the US and we’re keen to go to a sports game.\\nI’ve seen that the Yankees are playing the Red Sox and also the Giants are playing the Jets in a warm up game while we’re there. I know it’s a difficult question but wondered what people’s thoughts are on which would be the better option.\\nIn soccer, warm up/pre-season games can tend to be a bit of a non event with lots of changes to lineups and wondered if baseball might be the better option in this case.\\nAny advice/opinions would be much appreciated.\\nMany thanks! Go see the Yankees/Red Sox. Football games in August are pre-season games so that the teams are not playing to win. Its a time for coaches to evaluate players that have not secured starting positions. No one wants to risk a serious injury to a starter in pre-season so they play very little. Baseball is within NYC, while football is in NJ. There are special trains from Penn Station for the Meadowlands stadium at times, but you would have to check New Jersey Transit to confirm these. The baseball venues in NYC are both easily reached by subway. Go to the Yankees vs Redsox game. Not even a close choice. Yankees/Red Sox is a classic rivalry The Yankee game no doubt. The Yankees/Red Socks rivalry is great and these games are usually packed.\\nPre-season football would be a waste of time in my opinion. The rivalry between the Yankees & Red Sox usually means a lively experience For me, footballl is a much more lively experience than baseball. However, I agree that the players will not have as much skin in the game as baseball. In addition to this particular baseball game being much better than the particular football game; Maybe it\\'s just me but despite being a football fan I think watching it live actually makes it more boring as compared to TV. And in person the TV time outs are excruciating.\\nIn seriousness even if it was the superbowl I\\'d rather see it on TV.\\nBaseball on the other hand I love seeing live. Baseball has plenty of down time too but it\\'s part of the natural flow of the game. I fully agree with Hank. I have been to many football games, both pro and college, that were televised and the frequent time outs for commercials was maddening. You don\\'t notice it so much watching from home on TV. Televised baseball is very different and easier to watch in person.\\nGo Red Sox! You don\\'t notice the breaks when the outfielders throw the ball around for 5 minutes because the commercials are on? The game is slow paced and it gets even slower. Like watching the grass grow in left field. I\\'m looking for recommendations on the best shoes to wear in New York during December when I am there for Christmas. I have foot issues so I need something supportive and comfortable for lots of walking. Where are you from? Do you have cold/winter like conditions there? Do you do a lot of walking?\\nIf yes...bring what you would wear at home. Sneakers or whatever walking shoes you like.\\nIf it is rainy/slushy/snowy, I like Sperry duck boots. tell me if it will be warm or cold, and wet or dry, and I can give advice\\nWe go to NYC every year in December or January and pick our footwear the morning we leave home Trail shoes tend to have good support and work in about any conditions.\\nStrangers on the internet can not tell you brands or models that you will find comfortable. This question gets asked fairly frequently. Here\\'s the most recent with lots of ideas\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13574034-Shoes_for_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html For me I need low heeled ankle Boot, a good quality boot like Born brand. I want a walkable waterproof boot that’s warm and be stylish (to me) at the same time.\\nFor my winter vacations in New York City I bring two pairs of boots. I wouldn’t be comfortable in anything but a boot, my feet would be cold. but that’s just me. If it’s 45°F or under, I’m in a boot.\\nIt’s the same thing I would wear here (some days) in Santa Fe where I live.\\nOur winters have cold temperatures as we’re in the mountains ,7500 feet, but no humidity and snow.\\nYou will be walking a lot in New York City, it can’t be helped. it could be wet and slushy or it could be milder.\\nhttps://www.zappos.com/p/born-kerri-black-full-grain-leather/product/8614059/color/4082 LLBean makes something called \"snow sneakers\" Totally waterproof and insulated. Comes in both high top and low profile. If it\\'s cold and wet out these are great. Timberlands are also great too. They come wide so that\\'s nice. I need a lot of arch support and often add arch cookies to my shoes for additional support. I guess it would depends on your tolerance for cold weather.\\nI wear sneakers most of winter. Unless it snows then I wear my snow shoes.\\nIf you want to wear sneakers and you are not cold tolerant; then pairing the sneakers with Thermal Winter Socks is not a bad idea. Wear what you would wear now for a long walk in wet weather.\\nIf you don’t have shoes for that now, see your doctor. We can’t diagnose your podiatry issues. I wear sneakers all year. However, many models have ventilation panels that will admit water if you step in a puddle. A period of melting snow could be a problem for them. Snow tends to hold off until January. I am 63 yo female traveling to NYC alone.I am staying on Mulberry St during the Da Gennero festival. I am looking for a good place and time to people watch and enjoy the festival. I am also looking for the best cocktail bar to sit and enjoy people watching, maybe good entertainment and food if there is any such thing in Little Italy or within walking distance. Also is there any information on the Italian American museum opening? Little Italy is something of a contrived place as the Italians moved out to East Harlem, then the Bronx, nearly a century ago. It is currently a section of Chinatown with Italian restaurants of debatable quality. The festival tends to be rather crowded and some find the smell of cooking oil too much. It is popular with tourists.\\nEdited: 1:38 pm, July 25, 2021 If you want to have a good day of food shopping and tasting, I recommend going up to the Bronx, to Arthur Avenue: https://www.arthuravenuebronx.com/\\nVisit the Botanical Garden while you\\'re up there. I wouldn\\'t count on San Gennaro being in its normal form if it is held at all. The pandemic is coming back faster and stronger. I\\'m not sure what restrictions will come back in place, but I don\\'t really see a scenario where an event like this is allowed to happen in its typical form. It\\'s on city streets with people packed shoulder to shoulder, eating and drinking etc. Just don\\'t see it happening in 2021 given the direction the country is headed. The times that I have been down to the SG Festival, I never took note of how the local restaurants were set up. It was so crowded that I never thought of sitting outside at a restaurant.\\nI was down in that area yesterday. With all of the outdoor seating set up, people watching is not an issue. Just about everywhere has access.\\nI know Seamore has some entertainment. I head the singer yesterday as I walked by. It\\'s sort of a seafood place that I haven\\'t tried. Also can\\'t co-sign the entertainment.\\nBut if the event happens, you can sit/eat anywhere and watch the world go by. Thanks everyone. I have watched the world go by in Time Square, at the Macy\\'s parade and at the Statue of Liberty on separate trips to the city. This time is for me. I do worry about the new surge of the virus. I will check out Seamore. Any Idea on the new Italian American museum? Is it open yet? So we were planning on driving from Delaware to a train station in Jersey then taking the train into Jersey and do ferry to Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. Then I was thinking well since we\\'re there we might as well spend the night and do New York City with our teenage kids since it\\'s been 5 years since we\\'ve been. I think it will be too much to do both all in one day and take the train and drive back home again. My question is what\\'s the best way to do SOL and NYC with one hotel night? We would have our bags and I don\\'t really want to carry them around all of New York or Ellis Island and you can\\'t check in until 3:00. We could stay on the jersey side if it\\'s easier. I\\'m not really that familiar with New York as far as what stations to get off at and where you would get left off at if you\\'re taking the ferry from Statue of Liberty. Any information or ideas or clarification you could give me would be great. Or feel free to tell me if this is a terrible idea. Take a train or drive into the city, leave your bags at the hotel, park, go explore. Come back later in the day/evening to check in. Make your reservations for the SOL/EI for the next morning, the first ferry. Checkout of the hotel in the morning, but leave your bags, go explore and when you return, grab your bags and leave the city.\\nIt\\'s easy enough to find a garage within close distance to a hotel. Also make your Statue of Liberty reservations ASAP as that is arguably one of the most popular attractions & you don\\'t want to get shut out. There are lots of options. The 2 major choices are\\n1) stay in a hotel in Jersey City or Hoboken near a PATH train. You can drive to Liberty State Park and park there and go to the Statue from the NJ side. Then stay in NJ and use the PATH train the following day to sightsee in Manhattan,\\n2) park the car in NJ either near a PATH train or one of the ferries, stay in Manhattan. I have tickets late September to 2 Broadway shows and need outdoor dining options pre-theater. Have checked out the Perfect Pint, but would like other suggestions.\\nThank you, in advance, for recommendations.\\nJ I think reason you haven\\'t gotten responses yet may be that with theaters closed nobody has been eating in that area. Bumping this up in hope someone who has some ideas will see it and respond. I was in the area, and we ate at a Jamaican restaurant called Jasmine’s on west 46th. The food was good, and they had outdoor tables, as did other restaurants on this street. I imagine that once shows open again, this will be a pretty festive street for dining. Thank you. I will keep exploring.\\nJ Marseille (French - at 9th Av & 44th St) has outdoor seating. There\\'s a picture on their website that shows a covered structure for outdoor dining.\\nWhile I\\'ve eaten there several times and enjoyed it, the last time was about four years ago, so not recent experience.\\nhttps://marseillenyc.com/\\nYou might also take a look at \"restaurant row\", 46th St between 8th & 9th Ave. It\\'s lined with restaurants and has been designated one of NYC\\'s Open Streets - open to pedestrians and cyclists. Although I haven\\'t been since the pandemic started, my expectation is that many or most of the restaurants along that block would have outdoor dining. You could check their websites or call to confirm. A lot of places in the area haven\\'t reopened. You can go to\\nOpentable.com\\nand search theater district and outdoor dining. Thanks. I actually did that before I posted, but there wasn’t anything I found to book outdoors. Maybe just too early.\\nJ Hi. I’m looking for advice on a restaurant in NYC for 1 year anniversary. We would love fine dining/ steakhouse food with high energy atmosphere. Something sort of like Taboo in Cancun/Tulum. Or maybe just live music. I haven\\'t been to Tulum in 13 years so I have no idea what you\\'re talking about...but in any event, a restaurant that is popular in another country and in a resort area is not likely to be a good reference point for NYC. You need to be more specific. There are literally thousands of restaurants in NYC, and many are fine dining, and/or steak houses. \"High energy\" and \"fine dining\" often don\\'t go together as fine dining usually means more sedate. Everyone will start throwing their favorites at you for steakhouses, but I\\'m trying to get at what YOU want - a sedate, elegant restaurant or something with a youthful or energetic spirit? Or more of a boys club steakhouse? Live music and restaurants in NYC does not equal \"fine dining\". What\\'s your budget (in dollars, not something vague like \"not too expensive\")?\\nIf you want something \"fun\" and different, maybe try Tokyo Record Bar. Or maybe something like Tao. Or if you want something that has a bit of a young scene, and want steak, I would consider Catch Steak, that may be fun for you. The new Buddha Bar in Tribeca? Buddha Bar also jumped into my mind when I read the request.\\nIn addition,\\n- STK - NYC - https://stksteakhouse.com/venues/nyc-downtown/\\n- TBar - www.tbarnyc.com We will be in NYC for 5 days, want to do the city at a leisurely pace. We are not a lot into museums, can do one if it is a must see, we enjoy trying out different food and are up to walking.\\nPlan to explore Central Park, Ellis Island and Times Square.\\n1. We are going to be driving from Boston so any suggested places to check out along the drive? Upstate?\\n2. Can someone suggest a 5 day itinerary in NYC?\\n2. What would be the best location to stay?\\n3. Would you recommend getting a city pass?\\n4. Would you recommend getting a hop on, hop off?\\n5. Where are the best views of the skyline from?\\n6. Celebrating a special wedding anniversary, any reasonably priced restaurants to dine, maybe with city view, rooftop?\\nThanks in advance. No one will make a complete itinerary for you. There is no one itinerary that fits all. However, once you\\'ve narrowed down things of interest to you, it\\'s possible getting help tweaking how to group things together. If you\\'re on a laptop, there are some very helpful topics there, including one that covers some must-sees and must do\\'s.\\nWhat are your interests? What made you choose NYC?\\nDon\\'t buy a city pass and then plan your stay to get your moneys worth from it. In general, passes aren\\'t that great particularly for places that require timed tickets (there are more of those now due to the pandemic than it used to be). For example, it\\'s much better getting tickets to Statue of Liberty directly from the official seller than by using the passes. If you have decided what you want to do, and done the math of the costs you could check to see if the passes save you some money. In general, my take has been that I haven\\'t got my money\\'s worth from buying a pass but that\\'s me based on the things I\\'ve done when in town.\\nDo you have any food preferences? I. What route are you taking?\\n2. I agree with maxi that no one can create an itinerary for you as we do not know what you like and dislike (except for museums) and we don\\'t know if this is your first trip. Here are some of my go to: Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick Cathedral, Grand Central Station, New York Public Library, Bryant Park, Washington Square Park, and a cruise around the island whenever possible.\\n3. I also agree with maxi about the city pass\\n4. I would not recommend the hop on hop off bus, you will walk faster than the bus goes in traffic\\n5. There are observatories: Empire State Building (beautiful at night), Top of the Rock (beautiful during the day you can see Central Park), One World Observatory (I haven\\'t been yet but I hear the view is beautiful and the elevator experience is unmatched) and the Edge at Hudson Yards which opened after my last visit.\\nA little more information about your likes and dislikes will help Theater\\nShopping\\nDining\\nNature!\\nPeople watching\\nBoat tours\\nAmusement park\\nHistory\\nKayaking\\nObservation decks\\nGalleries\\nCycling\\nSome or all the above should fill your time.

We’re unpaid volunteers. If you’re willing to pay, there are services that will develop an itinerary based on your interests. I will say if you want to take a hop on/off bus tour, best to do it at the beginning of the trip and just stay on the bus to get the lay of the land.

Those 2 areas are about 20-30 mins away from each other by subway.\\n-Most first time visitors stay in midtown and many are convinced they must be in/near Times Square which is not true.\\n-Being near a subway stop is important. Being near multiple subway lines is even better.\\n-Google maps shows subway stops with a blue \"m\"\\nMaps.google.com\\n-Hotel prices fluctuate dramatically by date based on supply and demand and budget usually rules hotel decisions. Some people like to stay near where they plan to spend their evenings whether that be theater, jazz clubs or good dining while others want to be near Central Park for running. The financial district has become a popular place to stay lately as prices tend to be better value and it\\'s near many of the things people want to see (ferry to Statue and Ellis a island, 9/11 memorial, Wall st., etc.\\n3) there\\'s a build your own pass that allows you to pick and choose what to include.

Take a cruise.\\nSail-nyc.com\\ndoes great ones in small boats. They do brunch, jazz sunset etc. and have both sailboats and small yachts. Great views.\\n6). The Chart House in Weehawken, NJ is one idea for views and nice food. You\\'d take a ferry to get there.\\nhttps://www.chart-house.com/location/chart-house-weehawken-nj/\\nOn the right side of this page is a column titled “Top questions about NYC.” Lots of good information. The problem with having anyone else plan your vacation is that no one knows what you like the way you do. If you plan your vacation, you can make all the decisions not someone else who may or may not know what you really want to do or who may have an idea of what you should do that doesn\\'t fit you. Thanks you all for your wonderful mdetailed responses, gave me a good idea on thing sto do and not do. Hi\\nI have booked a trip to NY as a surprise for my husband’s 30th birthday. This falls over Super Bowl weekend and we are both American football fans.\\nIt will be nice not having to watch it with a massive time difference next year, and just have wondered if people have any suggestions or recommendations of where we can watch it.\\nI’m open to anything, sports bars, bars where you pay an entry fee. Anywhere that will have a good atmosphere.\\nI should add we are staying at the Hotel Edison but I’ve visited NY before and I’m quite happy to travel to a good spot!\\nThank you all in advance! I would wait to see which teams are in the Super Bowl before choosing a location. Why? There are \"team\" bars all throughout NYC where you could really experience the atmosphere that evening.\\nIf that may be too much, the majority of bars in the city will be showing the game. You will see Super Bowl ads on windows and signs outside.\\nYou can stop into 2-3 that Sat and ask what they are doing and how early you have to arrive to try and get a seat. Do know that the popular bars/spots fill up/are reserved very early. Hi\\nThank you so much for this! I didn’t know about the Team bars so that’s something good to look into.\\nI thought most places would get booked up quite quickly so thought if I start to get some ideas together now I can start to plan ahead.\\nThank you so much again! When I say that the bars get booked quickly, I mean during the mid/late playoffs. The SB is in mid Feb. I am talking late Jan/early Feb. Not that I\\'d be able to help anyway and I know you said you\\'re open to anything but you might want to define \\'good atmosphere\\' a more specifically. That can range anywhere from cheap bad beer and what\\'s about like a Frat basement on Saturday night to places where you can sit down and get some good food and good beer depending what you are looking for.\\nAgree it depends who is playing but pretty much any bar with TVs will be a unique to the day atmosphere. Kind of hard to predict in some ways because you never know if the people around you will be cool or total jerks. Hi Hank!\\nSo for me a good atmosphere is where you can sit and watch a game, have a couple of drinks and food, burgers and fries is good with us even just wings to be honest. People are getting involved with the game i.e shouting at the tv and it not being frowned upon by other guests at the bar.\\nWhen I watch English football, I like to hear the commentary or have background music but commentary is preferred.\\nI’ve only ever watched the NFL and College football at home, or in person at Wembley or one occasion we watched it at the Sports Bar on Boardwalk at Disney. These places are unlikely to get \"booked\". If you want a seat with a good view you should be prepared to show up 60-90 minutes before game time. Shorter time for larger and less specialized places. >>.You can stop into 2-3 that Sat and ask what they are doing and how early you have to arrive to try and get a seat. Do know that the popular bars/spots fill up/are reserved very early.<<<\\nI agree with this advice this is what I would do. Staying at the Hampton Inn Times Square South (Sept. 25 - Sept. 29) with 2 grandkids (10 and 14).\\nWe should be at the hotel by 2 pm or so. Plan on seeing the Lion King that night at 8:00.\\nThe other things we want to do for sure are:\\nStaten Island Ferry to see Statue of Liberty (or should we actually go to the Statue of Liberty)\\nEmpire State Building\\nMuseum of Natural History (kids are Night at the Museum fans)\\nCircle Line Cruise\\n9/11 Memorial (maybe Museum, too)\\nSea Glass Carousel\\nWe will have three full days so which of these would work on the same day without wearing us out?\\nWhat stores do you think a 10-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy would like? She is into softball, some video games, horses, unicorns. He plays baseball and football and is into video games.\\nOh and she definitely wants to see the Friends building. That is a must for her.\\nSorry for all the questions. Staten Island Ferry, Sea glass carousel, 9/11 memorial (and if you add the museum) can be grouped together. They\\'re within walking distance of one another.\\nYou could also look into Classic Harbor Line for cruises, their boats are smaller - all seats will have good views.\\nYou could do ESB on your first afternoon, in between dropping of your luggage at the hotel and the musical. The SOL/EI is one of the top attractions and in my opinion, it\\'s definitely worth visiting. I would discuss it with the kids and see how they feel. I look at it this way, the Staten Island Ferry is free and gives you views of the Statue and lower Manhattan, but you\\'ll spend an hour to an hour and a half going and coming. Put that time towards actually going to both the SOL/EI. Yes, you\\'ll spend more time overall, but you\\'ll have taken in so much more. They are timed tickets and you should only buy from Statue Cruises, they\\'re the official seller:\\nhttps://www.cityexperiences.com/new-york/city-cruises/statue/\\nConsidering the short stay, you could combine the SOL/EI with the 9/11 Museum and Memorial. It will make for a long day, but you will take in so much.\\nI would add Central Park on the day you visit the AMNH. If you take a sightseeing cruise the SI Ferry is probably redundant\\nSee if any of these arcades are of interest https://www.timeout.com/new-york-kids/things-to-do/the-best-kid-friendly-arcades-in-nyc You should look at a map of Manhattan, it will become obvious what should be grouped together.\\nManhattan is long and narrow, the Museum is Uptown, on the West Side of Central Park, your hotel, the Lion King (Broadway Theater District/Times Square) and ESB is all in the midtown area (ESB is approx 15 blocks south, depending where you start). The \"Friends\" building is further south, in Greenwich Village, in between \"midtown\" and the Financial District/Battery Park where 9/11 Memorial, SI Ferry, SoL/EL ferry both leave from.\\nIIf you stop to see the Friends building, you should also consider going to Washington Square Park, and may also want to go to the Meatpacking District and walk the High Line and/or Little Island. There is also some kind of \"Friends Experience\" going on https://www.friendstheexperience.com/new-york/tickets With kids that age, I would definitely go to Ellis Island. It is a great way to learn how out great country was built. If you can arrange for the Staten Island ferry trip to be just before sunset and the return to be after dark, you get both views of Manhattan—daytime, and with the lights on, which is spectacular. There’s an outlet mall near the terminal on Staten Island if you need to fill some time, although it’s not all up and running yet. Also, the Seaglass Carousel is more dramatic at night with the lights on. Depending on which day of the week you’re doing this and if the weather is good for outdoor dining, you can have dinner at The View in Battery Park (they’re closed Monday and Tuesday), or Lovelace nearby, or at the Seaport (many places to choose from). The Staten Island Ferry passes the statue, but at a distance. Some people like to get closer, but that was not the intended view. The ferry is about 30 mins. each way. One must get off in Staten Island and rush around to the waiting room for the return boat. The boats are not coordinated and you may have to wait. The 9-11 Museum might be rather strong for the children as it is for some adults. The 9-11 Memorial is a peaceful place. The Natural History Museum is one of the largest in the world and you can spend much time and shoe leather there. They recently opened a rebuilt gems and mineral gallery that has rather spectacular specimens. There are also meteorites that I believe one can touch. The Theodore Roosevelt bronze statue in front of the museum may be removed by your visit. There were objections ro the African and Native American figues. Be aware that some aspects of the film such as the ancient Egyptian characters are not displayed here, but may be found in the Met Museum of Art. Thank you so much for all your answers. Especially the Friends experience. She can quote Friends word for word. I can\\'t wait to surprise her with that one.\\nI think we will skip the 9/11 museum and just do the memorial. Since you\\'re only visiting the Memorial, you will have time to explore more of downtown if you choose. Maybe a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge for example?\\nHere is a great site for things to see/do downtown:\\nhttps://downtownny.com/ if we reserve the Empire State Building at 4:00 will that still give us to time to get to the Minskoff Theater by 8:00? EWR\\'s main runway closing for rehab:\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/newark-runway-construction\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/newark-airport-runway-mess/?utm_source=TPG%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2637185&utm_usr=9e594564580372016592cac97c9beb137cdcdbf814ce05cfdb43095b9c0df7f1&utm_msg=df2712dbec7547c98546b6a4584cdf91&utm_date=2021-07-25 While all of United\\'s international and many domestic long haul flights use EWR, they recently returned some California flights to JFK, so that is an option for people headed there who don\\'t want to risk EWR. Also, I believe UA flies as far west as Denver out of LGA. But as far as international flights are concerned, I wouldn\\'t risk EWR and would look for alternatives out of JFK. Note, as points guy mentioned, if a UA flight to Rome is canceled because of these issues, then the inbound flight from Rome the next day is also canceled, and there aren\\'t that many other options on which to rebook people these days, meaning it may take several days to clear up backlog. I think that article said this is expected to last until at least Oct. 1. My apologies if this question has been asked. I\"m looking at coming into NYC from White Plains then using the subway while in NYC, then the Metro North back to White Plains. I\\'m assuming I can buy a round trip metro north ticket that can be used on separate days. But can I also add subway fares onto the same Metro North ticket or do I need to buy a separate Metro Card for the subway? https://new.mta.info/mta-etix\\nhttps://omny.info/\\nYou can get an app for metro north tickets. Might save you some time. You don\\'t need a metrocard you can just use a credit/debit card to tap and go for the subway. I believe the machines in grand central at least used to let you buy tickets and put money on a metrocard at same time. I think that was an option but it may only be an option on specific ticket machines if I recall correctly. I rarely used that feature as I always had an independent metrocard and nowadays with all the changes I don\\'t see why you would even need something like that eve if it is still offered.\\nEdited: 5:32 pm, July 25, 2021 You do have an option to purchase a Metrocard when buying Metro North tickets at the machines. I\\'m from Texas and my husband and I will be in New York for 4 nights in September over Labor Day. We are going to the US Open ON Labor Day... our other days will be spent exploring all the \"touristy\" things. Not sure where the best place for us to stay is. I want to be where we have lots of options for bars/restaurants in the evening... I though midtown would be our best bet but now I\\'m 2nd guessing myself. I know we want to see Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Top of the Rock, and Central Park. But I also want to see the 9/11 Memorial, Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn Bridge. Looking for suggestions for hotels and areas to stay.... and any other tidbits of helpful information would be great! We also have never ridden on a subway before so looking forward to experiencing that! We also have no problem walking places either. Thanks for any input! The #7 train that runs under 42nd St. is the route to the US Open in Flushing. It is not necessary to stay in this location as there are transfers to this line from others at 5-6th Ave., Times Square, and Grand Central. The ride is about 30 mins., a bit faster if the express is running in the afternoon rush. If you want to stay somewhere in between all of those sights you might like Union Square, Flatiron, NoMad, Greenwich Village, East Village, Lower East Side.\\nThese are less touristy than Midtown with lots of local restaurants but you\\'d need to subway (or bus) between the uptown and downtown sights.\\nStaying in Midtown is not so bad, the west side area of Hell\\'s Kitchen has heaps of restaurants and bars, and then subway downtown to the 9/11 Memorial, SOL etc.\\nMidtown East has quieter areas yet it\\'s still walkable to many of your listed sights. The subway will take 20 mins to half an hour to get right downtown from there. I\\'ve stayed a few times in the downtown/financial district and really liked it there as a home base. There are multiple subway lines within 3 blocks of each other since Manhattan narrows in its width. This allowed me to easily get anywhere in the city and when I got off the subway, my hotel would be close by. I look for different deals but have stayed at the Fairfield Inn WTC and the Holiday Inn WTC. Both had nice rooms and very easy access to transportation.\\nAnother area that can have some good deals is Long Island City. It is one stop from Manhattan and very easy to jump on the 7 to go to the US Open. If you like walking I would suggest a hotel close to Bryant Park. I did stay there during one of my many trips and was able to walk up to Central Park and also down to Battery Park. It\\'s close enough to Times Square without being in the middle of it.\\nNothing against the subway just an absolute fear of missing out.\\nEdited: 9:22 pm, July 23, 2021 Midtown is okay for tourists. Consider Greenwich Village/East Village and that area.\\nDefinitely experience the subways! Cabs can be so slow and expensive! I absolutely love NYC and visit a couple of times a year (in normal times). The subway system is challenging. I often wonder if it\\'s a game to stump the tourists! If you\\'re confused at any point just ask someone. I have found locals to be friendly and helpful. They change the rules-- especially on the weekends.\\nHave fun! As you realize the sights are spread out - what that means is you could stay in pretty much anywhere in downtown/midtown and even uptown Manhattan and you\\'ll be close to lots of places while lots of other places will be a subway/bus/long walk away.\\nHaving said that I personally would recommend LES/East Village or Greenwich Village/Chelsea/Flatiron. Though absolutely no problem staying around Midtown. Public transportation is efficient and frequent. Consider the area near grand central, great subway connection for the open, 911, Statue of Liberty, etc ***If you like walking I would suggest a hotel close to Bryant Park. I did stay there during one of my many trips and was able to walk up to Central Park and also down to Battery Park. It\\'s close enough to Times Square without being in the middle of it.\\nNothing against the subway just an absolute fear of missing out.***\\njcmtl, I know you enjoy walking, I do as well, but it\\'s nearly a 4 mile walk from Bryant Park to Battery Park. For some, that is just not possible. I agree with you about walking and not missing out, but sometimes the ability to get to different neighborhoods in minutes as opposed to hours allows people to take in more in terms of what they want to see. Nothing wrong with getting lost in the walk, it just depends on the person and their plans.\\nAs far as hotel choice, you have attractions in midtown and also downtown. You could choose either area and subway to the attractions outside of where you stay. Or, you can choose a neighborhood and then take the subway to the attractions. Union Square, the Village, and Soho for starters is where I\\'d suggest. >>Not sure where the best place for us to stay is. I want to be where we have lots of options for bars/restaurants in the evening...<<<\\nThe Flatiron District comes to mind as my choice for you. Its well located for uptown, downtown sites and getting to the US open. This neighborhood has many hotels of different price points and is a lively, pretty neighborhood with restaurants, bars and Madison Square Park. It’s kind of in the middle so to speak of Manhattan.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Neighborhood-g60763-n7102347-Flatiron_District-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nI also suggest that you download CItymapper transportation app. Try using it in when choosing a hotel ,so you will know how to get to sites from hotel choices or if things are walkable before you book.\\nI learned the subway system just by using this app, now I get around the city like a pro.\\nI never choose a hotel without first Checking my hotels location with this app. Planning on booking a trip to NYC in March. It is our first time and wondering how long we should do?\\nDon’t have a budget so please recommend hotels that are pretty much close to everything!\\nWhere to go shopping? Is designer items actually cheaper than the UK? Things are spread out, there is no one area that is \"close to everything\".\\nI would come here for at least a week, it will give a nice overview.\\nEdited: 5:25 pm, July 13, 2021 Youneed to aquire a guidebook as there is far too much to see & do to give you a one size fits all itinerary. As for how long you should stay, you should build a draft itinerary & we\\'ll be happy to criti que it for you. As for hotel recommendations we need your exact dates of travel as hotel rates vary daily, your budget in US$ (there.s no sense in our recommending a hotel you can\\'t afford) and your prefered bedding configuration. I am not a shopper so I can\\'t help you with that except to say that there are clothing choices at all price points.\\nus\\nEdited: 5:27 pm, July 13, 2021 One thing to be aware of when shopping for designer clothing: There is a NYC sales tax on all clothing items over $110 of 8.875%. If you\\'re buying high end designer clothing, that adds up. And no, you don\\'t get that back. I believe Macy\\'s has some kind of discount for tourists, but that\\'s not my destination for \"designer clothing.\"\\nIf you catch Bloomingdales, Saks, or Bergdorf Goodman on sale, you can do very well. There are \"friends and family sales\" of 20-25% off in early spring and early fall, then around Thanksgiving, sales go to 40% off, and then 70% off right before or after Christmas (if you can do pre-sale - find a good salesperson to help if you\\'re in town at that time)\\nThere are also many discounters. They will NOT have this year\\'s merchandise, it\\'s last years or even way earlier (I\\'ve seen items that I bought 5 years earlier), and it\\'s often more expensive than the last markdown of the current season at the major department stores. If you need basics, go for it. (Saks Off Fifth, Nordstrom Rack, TJ Maxx, Burlington...places like that.) But be aware that it is not current season.\\nMajor designers that ship around the world have standardized pricing on new items. Tax will be a factor as will timing of sales. Also, not every item in every designer line is available in every store. You may see different versions of different colors of items by the same designer that you find in the UK vs what you find in NY. To me, shopping on vacation is one of the joys of travel. It\\'s not really the bargains that get me (although I would like to think I\\'m a genius at finding the \"best\" price...I\\'m probably fooling myself), it\\'s finding something you won\\'t find at home. Or buying it as a way to remember your vacation. We all have different reasons for shopping. There will be no hotel near everything. Tourist sites are grouped around midtown and the financial district which are about 20-30 mins. apart by subway. Some people prefer staying near where they like to eat or nightlife. Others want to be near theaters. Price usually leads hotel choice.\\nAs for shopping, American brands will always be cheaper here but European brands may be the same price or possibly more here. What designer names interest you? Compared to the rest of the country where things are truly spread out, if you stay in Manhattan you will not be that far from anything. Public transportation is easily accessible.\\nMidtown can be noisy but that is probably the \"heart\" of it all. I really like the Murray Hill n\\'hood.\\nFor my daughter (now an adult) who doesn\\'t like big crowds, it is a bit residential. When travelling with my mobility impaired hubby, it\\'s usually easy to find a taxi.\\nFor most it is walkable to Times Square. It\\'s a short walk to Grand Central where several subway lines cross and from there you have the subway shuttle to Times Square.\\nIt\\'s not for everybody but I think it is a great location for first timers. Jersey Gardens outlet mall in Elizabeth, NJ is great for cheap shopping and no tax on clothes in NJ. I believe buses run there from NYC. If you choose to go to any of the outlet malls (whether Jersey Gardens or Woodbury Commons), be aware that the same admonition about last year’s clothing (or items specifically manufactured for the outlet stores) applies. Check the list of stores before you go to figure out if it’s what you’re interested in. Hi! I\\'ve been to NYC many times (used to go at least 3 times a year) but I have back issues now that prevents me from travel where a lot of walking is necessary. But walking is the best way to see NYC in my opinion. Normally I would stay at a friends place across from Central Park but this particular year she had moved to Florida so we got a hotel. I was meeting my best friend there and she\\'d never been so she wanted to do a lot of touristy things and we stayed in Times Square. We LOVED it. The view from the room was beautiful especially with the 25 inches of snow we got that trip! What a treat for me since I live in Charlotte and rarely see snow more than 3 inches! She is from Maine so I’m sure my little girl excitement was amusing to her 😊\\nAnyway, we thought our hotel was perfectly located...we walked everywhere because they shut down the subway due to the winter wonderland storm. The hotel closed during covid I believe but it’s was Novotel-Times Square and I’m sure it’s another one now. I think it’s broadway and 52nd. Hope this helps!! Majesty318, just a note that clothing made of fur is taxable in NJ, as are sports team uniforms and a couple of other items. Jewelry is taxed. What’s the Price of an Uncleaned Hotel Room? https://nyti.ms/3iEPYCU\\nThis story is in NY Times travel section this weekend. Though it doesn\\'t concern NYC hotels specifically, some of the (occasionally stomach turning) comments do. I highly recommend reading them, in addition to the article.\\nBottom line, some US hotels and US-based hotel chains are adopting permanently changes temporarily put into effect during lockdown. It made me think of some of the questions I probably need to get answered before I book a hotel room again. Like does the rate quoted include daily housekeeping and in-person check in and out? If not, is there a supplemental charge for those \"services?\" If housekeeping is only upon request, how much advance notice is required? (One commenter said that when they asked for housekeeping service they were told they could not have it because they had failed to book it on time -- 24 hour advance booking was required).\\nThe \"experts\" seem to think the trend is for hotels to go the route of the airlines and offer some \"services\" on an a la carte basis. So just as it may cost you $30 or $40 to check a bag and $15 for a snack, it may cost you $30 or $40 to have your room cleaned, $15 for a breakfast bag and another $15 if you elect in person instead of online checkout. Also, several commenters complained about the resort fees that continue to be charged by hotels that are not currently providing \"services\" allegedly covered by resort fee. Also, I believe it was a Hilton spokesperson who said these new a la carte policies would not affect their luxury brands, like Waldorf Astoria and Conrad.\\nEdited: 5:59 pm, July 25, 2021 For two nights only at the Radio City Music Hall, on August 3rd and August 5th, see this pair perform their final duo together, with a compilation album expected out later this year.\\nThey are a great pair together, I saw them when they performed last at the Radio City Music Hall (2015 I think it was) and it was a surprising and enjoyable show.

Unfortunately the backstage tours are not on at this time but they would have been good to do if you had the time in your schedule. What is the subway fare for paying via OMNY? I understand it\\'s $2.75 if you have a metrocard Yesterday we needed a cab from 5th Ave & E. 72nd St down to E. 34th St. Ferry. I got a cab to stop for us and he asked where we were going. He then said it would be cash only, his “meter” wasn’t working. I’m thinking he meant the credit card reader wasn’t working, but the meter not working would be an even bigger red flag. Once we refused the ride, you could see he was angered. I’m almost 100% certain he was trying to screw us over. The next driver to stop said CC were accepted and he received a 25% tip from us for his honesty. This has happened to me a handful of times, not only in NYC but other places as well. I’m sure many newbies fall for this. I wonder what fare the first guy would have given us if we had accepted. Probably happens in every city in the world that I have visited. Had a \"broken meter\" last week. I took a picture of the license plate and reported him. ***Probably happens in every city in the world that I have visited.***\\nSo true.\\n***I took a picture of the license plate and reported him.***\\nThat\\'s the way to do it. I once had a driver ask how much we wanted to pay for the ride. I said \"whatever the meter tells me to pay\". When he pushed more my husband said \" $3\"\\nHe turned on the meter and drove. Yes, definitely report shady cab drivers they need to be identified and weeded out. Unfortunately dirty cab drivers are a problem in many places and NYC is no exception. The difference is in NYC it is pretty easy to report a cab driver that pulls this nonsense ***I took a picture of the license plate and reported him.***\\nThat\\'s the way to do it.\\nHow did you report it? ***How did you report it?***\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/file-a-complaint.page I once took cabs more often than I do now (having decided that subway and walking are a superior combination of transport), and had a few experiences at taxi court when I filed complaints. I won all of them, including one on appeal when the driver’s lawyer and the judge were obviously in collusion. That complaint involved a ridiculously out-of-the-way route from the airport and a large overcharge, which I recovered. I was once chatting with a good driver about taxi court, and he said that it usually favors the passengers. The system has changed since then but it’s still worthwhile to file a complaint.\\nIn my limited cab experience during and since the pandemic (figuring exposure to one person was better than exposure to many people), I was impressed with the service I received. Some of the drivers had rigged up barriers to protect passengers and themselves. Yes, I\\'ve had shenanigans with taxi drivers happen here in SF. Like cancelling a pickup or not showing up because it\\'s a neighborhood that\\'s a bit out of the way. Or the classic \"card reader isn\\'t working” if they only want to accept cash. I don\\'t think I\\'ve had ”meter\\'s not working” excuse to charge whatever they feel like yet.\\nI was hoping the spankings that taxi drivers got from Uber and Lyft would make them try to shut down some problems in order to compete, but not sure it really has. Lots of them are good in a hard job, but you get the occasional ones like that. We\\'re a group of 7 with 10 bags, What\\'s the safer way and best prices to go to JFK from Manhattan? Do you mind splitting up or do you want to travel in one group? Are you willing/able to wrangle your luggage so you could consider public transit? Regular yellow taxis are a fixed rate with certain add ons from Manhattan to JFK. There are some larger taxis, but not as large as you would need. Some car services might offer larger vehicles, but I imagine they would not be the most economical. Just to be clear subway is the most economical but it would mean schlepping luggage up or down stairs & I can\\'t imagine all of your party getting seats in the same subway car. I would probably break up into 2 or 3 cabs for the conveniece after a flight where some in your group might be too tired to deal but I don\\'t know how young & fit you are (& therefore better able to cope with the hassle. Time and cost efficient. Doesn’t require “schelpping up stairs.” Escalators and elevators are available:\\nAirtrain: JFK to Jamaica Station\\nLIRR (train): Jamaica Station to Penn Station\\nBest of luck!\\nEdited: 2:42 am, July 25, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 11:26 am, July 29, 2021\\nEdited: 11:26 am, July 29, 2021 Yellow cabs between JFK and Manhattan are a fixed price (~$75/per cab after tip and possible tolls) Cabs can hold 4 (a few can hold 5) so your group would need to split up into two vehicles. https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/taxi-car-and-van-service\\nTransit is $10.50/person ($7.75 Airtrain + $2.75 subway) https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/public-transportation\\nWhile the transfer points between the Airtrain & subway have elevators, do not assume the destination subway station has an elevator https://new.mta.info/map/5256\\nIf considering public transport, verify the route options, proximity of your hotel to the closest subway station(s) and existence of an elevator by using the MTA trip planner https://new.mta.info/ IF your hotel is within walking distance of Penn Station the Airtrain / LIRR commuter train option is worth considering but the transit fares will cost a bit more As long as there are 2 adults, I think two yellow taxis are the easiest. I will be driving from Manhattan to show my family Coney Island. Does anyone have info about parking in that area?\\nMany thanks,\\nJoefromLynn You can certainly find parking.\\nTaking the train is the better experience in my opinion especially when you get close and start to see the rides from the elevated tracks. I attempted to find parking a few weekends ago, after about 20 Mins I gave up and went home The weekends are always packed. OP is going during the week. A little less hectic.\\nEdited: 9:09 pm, July 20, 2021 If street / metered parking is difficult there are parking lots https://www.coneyisland.com/tourist-information I echo Ter\\'s recommendation on taking the train. Finding free parking is doable, but does require some patience. 20 minutes on a weekday is acceptable to me. If it only took 20 minutes to do it on the weekend, I\\'d give thanks to Parkamithius (the Greek God of Parking).\\nIf it\\'s during the summer months, finding parking is heavily affected by beach traffic. A less than stellar day for the beach can make it easier. A closer walk is to the west (sometimes well) past Ford\\'s Theater. A farther walk is Brighton Beach, but I feel more comfortable with my car there and added bonus of experiencing the cultures of the ex-Soviet states. While you are there do visit the aquarium! Can someone please recommend a restaurant for our anniversary dinner tonight? Coming into the city from Westchester and will be going to Washington Square park first. Would like a place that is on the quiet side. Not too expensive, but nice atmosphere. Thank you! You may have a problem finding a table you can reserve at such short notice on a Sat. Night.

As a traveler who needs a certificate and who will paying out of pocket rather than using insurance, I doubt I qualify for a free one anywhere, but I\\'ve googled galore, and everything seems to be at least $200. Any suggestions appreciated. Thanks. I\\'m not sure which tests they do, or whether it would be in timeframe required for your flight, but I don\\'t believe the public hospitals (like Bellevue & Harlem in Manhattan) and clinics charge or make issues about citizenship. Anyway, might be worth checking their website. Thanks. I think I\\'m going to pay for it at the airport. More expensive but much faster. Does anyone have any experience with the virtual line at the Harry Potter store on a Friday or Saturday? I\\'m wondering how long it may be for our turn to enter, after we get in the line? Do we have to get there right at 7am? Are people waiting even earlier? There isn\\'t a lot of stuff we want to do around that exact area, so we are trying to figure out how to get there, join the line, go somewhere we want to visit, and then make it back when we are told it is our turn. Any insight would be appreciated. No experience here, virtual lines, that\\'s a new one, LOL.\\nHave you checked reviews? I\\'d start there, also, call the store, I\\'m sure they have the best information about their system.

Like the many restaurants that will text you when your table is ready instead of 20 people clogging the entrance or sidewalk. This Park in Canarsie came up in another discussion and I thought Id visit it today. Its a very nice park and a pretty solitutde experience on the beach. Its right under the belt Parkway.\\nThis area is about a 15 min Cab ride from JFK, You can walk on the Bike/ Hiking path to the Canarsie Pier.\\nSolitude like this is rare in NYC\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/KZkSOHF Howard, I just went to that park a couple of weeks ago, and loved it! I’ve been to the Canarsie Pier a number of times, and always thought that the park was just the scrubby/marshy area on either side of the pier. Then I looked at a map (duh) and realized that the actual park was much more extensive. I loved the nature path that goes into the small hills and eventually takes you to the beach. Great place to see herons, egrets, oystercatchers, ospreys, etc. The park was very clean & well-maintained, and I ended up chatting at length with some Canarsie birders.\\nIt’s a hike to get there by public transit, so I don’t know how often I’ll do it, but it can be done: L train to the end of the line, then the B42 bus, which you get right in the train station, then a short(ish) walk.\\nEdited: 7:16 am, July 13, 2021 I didnt start at the Canarise Pier, I started at the other end , Seaview Ave and E 80th St\\nThe Bike/Hiking path was in mint condition and the beach area (Obviopusly I wouldn\\'t swim there) was deserted by fairly clean. Its about a mile and a half walk from where I was to the Canarsie Pier.\\nIt was a bit noisy due to the belt parkway, but it was still a spot of Solitude\\n(IMO the quiet parts of NYC are the most uninteresting, residential neighborhoods in Eastern Queens , Certain Parts of Brooklyn (Like Mill Basin) or Staten Island >>> I didnt start at the Canarise Pier, I started at the other end , Seaview Ave and E 80th St<<<\\nSame for me on my recent visit; there’s a bus stop at Seaview, and I walked from there. Nice pics Howard! The one which shows the rocks under the bridge and the turf behind is where I take my mid-ride break when I bike down to the beach at Belle Harbor. It is hard to see from the pics, but that turf is a wonderful, cool, quiet spot.\\nIn this packed, frenetic city of ours, with just a bit of snooping, we can find our treasures of quiet solitude. My favorite spots are Mt. Zion Cemetery, the Naval Cemetery Landscape and the Columbia Street Pier in BK. Wow, takes me back to childhood. I\\'ve spent time at that park and the pier as a child. Even went to a boot camp workout My grandparents lived on the other side of the canal in the Georgetowne neighborhood. >>>Mt. Zion Cemetery, the Naval Cemetery Landscape and the Columbia Street Pier in BK.<<<\\nI know & love the last two, so I guess I need to look up Mt. Zion.\\nThe Naval Cemetery Landscape is a particular treasure IMO, a tiny patch of meadow in an industrial area. I always peek in when I’m running or biking to/from Williamsburg, and feel lucky when the gates are open (the hours are rather limited). I\\'ll be spending a long day in the Flushing Meadows Corona Park area (botanical garden, Queens Museum, Met\\'s game) and am looking for a quick (takeout or food truck) and inexpensive ($10 or so or less) lunch. I eat all genres and will be basically travelling the globe gastronomically this trip. Any suggestions? Where would you grab lunch? I thought about going to the New World Mall food court but I was looking for something closer to the park. But if the food court is highly recommended, I\\'ll go there. There is a permanent hot dog stand at the bottom of the ramp as one enters the park from the subway/stadium. Other than that, there might be an ice cream truck further in the park near the soccer fields. The park is rather isolated with major highways on both sides and non-residential areas to the north. There are some South American places on Roosevelt Ave. west of the park, though they are not of the best quality. East of the park is Flushing whose main activity is food, both fresh and prepared. There are many restaurants though they tend to be Asian with Chinese of various kinds predominating. If you know where to look, there are Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Other than burger places, the only western restaurant is an Italian one in the Marco Hotel at Northern Blvd. and Farrington St. called Magna.\\nThe New World Mall food court pre-pandemic had perhaps 25 stalls in a noisy setting with long shared tables. Upstairs are nicer places to eat, but I have never had the experience as their menus were not in English.\\nI suggest either the subway to go the one stop or the bus from LGA into Flushing. The Roosevelt Ave. Bridge, the largest fixed trunnion bascule bridge in the world when built, is under repair and the walk is not pleasant. Thanks for the advice! I may end up eating a large breakfast and then have an early dinner before the Met\\'s game since it\\'ll be a Saturday and the Queen\\'s Night Market will be up and running. If you don\\'t want to travel out of your way, there are plenty of options at Citifield. The grilled cheese pinwheels look disgustingly delicious. I have a distant memory of those arancini balls being decent. The fish and chips uses to be good but I don\\'t see that they\\'re still there. https://www.goodfoodstories.com/mets-citi-field-food/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=webstories&utm_campaign=citi_field citifield is known for food It’s been a while, and it may be farther than you want to walk - but IIRC, there are a number of Central and South American food vendors & small restaurants along 111th St between the 7 train and the park. Thank you everyone. I guess I\\'ll play it be ear. I\\'ll have dinner at Citi field and then get something at the night market after the game. If I find myself needing lunch, I\\'ll jump on the train. If I find anything different like a new food truck or decent cart, I\\'ll report back. I leave for NYC a week from tomorrow. I\\'ll drop some trip reports. My recommendation is Leo\\'s Latticini which is a 10 minute walk from the Hall of Science on 104th Street. It\\'s also know as Mama\\'s of Corona. They are one of the last old school Italian places around. Family business in its third generation (while they make your food, check out the pictures they have up. The wonderful woman who runs it loves two things in life: Her family and the Mets, and pics of both are over the place, right along with the schoolkids drawings from nearby St. Leo\\'s. You can take your food to go or sit down in their peaceful backyard in their bakery two doors down. If they have the artichokes (its not everyday), they get them!\\nIf you do that, a nearby bonus is the open air market at Corona Plaza, which is 5 minutes away on foot, right next to the 103rd Street stop. The market sort of materialized during COVID it\\'s definitely one of the more unique things in the city now. It will definitely help if you have some knowledge of Spanish.\\nEdited: 6:33 am, July 24, 2021 I’m a local, but I’ve bookmarked #7 for future reference…thanks, Bendico!\\nEdited: 7:31 am, July 24, 2021 I would venture into downtown Flushing. There\\'s many authentic Asian eateries. Maybe even going on a food crawl. Maybe have two or three smaller meals at different places. Hello\\nI will be visiting NYC in August and i really enjoy cycling. Im interested where are best places to practice it rides around 50 miles long. I heard about Empire State Trail, is it good? Take a look at the Hudson River Greenway Trail, it\\'s part of the EST:\\nhttps://empiretrail.ny.gov/map You didn\\'t mention your specific dates.\\nIf you happen to be in NYC on the 22nd - consider doing the 5 Boro Bike Tour - a really cool way to see the city and get in a 40 mile bike ride. Disclaimer - it starts pretty crowded - but if you arrive early and/or are willing to work your way towards the front over the beginning miles, you can keep a good pace for most of the ride.\\nThe event is sponsored by Bike NY https://www.bike.nyc/\\nEven if you don\\'t do the event - check out their site - as it\\'s a good resource for information on biking in NY.\\nAnd - to your original question - yes, the Empire State Trail is a good option - but you\\'ll either want to get out early - or be prepared for lots of people around - many of whom will not be paying attention to you on your bike - so you\\'ll need to ride with caution. BTW - I should have noted - if you want more \"serious\" rides - check out the routes on Strava (the 9W might suit you).\\nOr even consider taking a ferry to NJ (Sandy Hook or Highlands) for a pleasant boat ride and a lot of route options. If you want to give the latter a try - direct message me - and describe the type of route you want (e.g., flat and along the ocean? Hilly and past horse farms? Are you comfortable with traffic, or do you want more \"country roads\" etc.) and I can suggest a route or two.\\nEdited: 10:58 am, July 18, 2021 I was going to mention 9W in my earlier post, there are so many riders on that roadway, especially on the weekends. And yeah, some serious riders, full tights and all.\\nI believe there is a way to get from the Hudson River Greenway to be able to walk across the GWB, then connect with 9W once in NJ. Yes 9W is common for longer distance bike rides. The Empire State trail is great, but that\\'s not cycling in NYC, that\\'s cycling away from the city. Are you just looking for a place to train, covering ground as quickly as you can, or are you also interested in using the bike to see more of the city? Depending on your comfort level when it comes to sharing the road with cars and your goals, there are many different options for doing so. If you are interested in doing mountain biking check out mtbproject.com or trailforks.com - lots of trails upstate you can get to via Metro North. Hi All,\\n3 of us have 6 nights during Christmas to visit daughter. Realize it\\'s peak season and everything\\'s expensive. C\\'est la vie. Target location: Upper East Side (63rd/6th or Upper West Side)-- nearby museums, restaurants, galleries & the Park with plenty to do as daughter works 24/7. Quiet, with kitchen, and would prefer adults vs. screaming families and kids crying. Times Square-no thank you. Tried for vacation rentals, but too much chance of being a scam Air BNB is pricier than a hotel w/ot amenities, plus never know what you\\'re getting.\\nNeed 2 rooms. Or one suite one room.\\nAffinia & Beacon sounded good but get terrible reviews, sounds quite shabby, bug infested even though location sounds great. I keep seeing that there are \"many more options than Beacon & Affinia, but I can\\'t find them. Any suggestions? Thank you!!!! Trump International is probably the most upscale option in your target area. I don\\'t know which Affinia you looked at but Affinia Gardens is ok. The Marmara Park Ave is probably the newest, most luxurious apt hotel but it’s in Murray Hill. The Surrey on the upper east side is another option but very expensive. I\\'m curious where you saw reviews where these hotels get terrible reviews, sound quite shabby, are bug infested etc because here on TA the most recent reviews are not all bad. Most are quite good. Nothing is perfect but I don\\'t know if those hotels are as bad as you think.\\nIf you\\'re willing to travel a little further south, the AKA properties (Sutton Place might work, and the Central Park one is just south of Central Park) might be worth looking into.\\nThe Residence Inns offer kitchens and some have separate bedrooms.\\nIf you\\'re willing to travel way downtown, Mint House at 70 Pine might be an option There are quite a few nice options in Murray\\nHill. It’s a quick subway ride or taxi to most sights. Best Western Hospitality House might work even though a different location. \" I keep seeing that there are \"many more options than Beacon & Affinia, but I can\\'t find them\"\\nWhat price range? I caught a bit of a story on the local news tonight about the Manhattan marriage license bureau reopening for in-person visits -- that is, both for getting licenses and getting married. However, you can\\'t just show up; you have to make an appointment online through the city\\'s \"cupid\" website. Hi guys, i\\'m planning to travel in January to New York.\\nI have never traveled anywhere. I\\'m from Germany and i\\'m 20 years old, do you recommend New York for first time solo traveler? Thanks. I definitely recommend it. There is so much to see/do/experience in NYC! It is one of the top travel cities in the world.\\nI would start by mapping out how long you can spend in NYC. Then start making a list of attractions/places/things you wish to see & do.\\nThen ask more questions here on Tripadvisor and also do your own research.\\nGood luck! Probably among one of the easiest destinations in the US for an international solo traveler assuming you have some experience with large cities. Just be aware that some hotels do not allow singles under 21 to check in. The biggest problems may be the age restriction at hotels and the inability to legally drink alcohol if you like a drink or two. You must be 21+ to drink alcohol in establishments such as restaurants and bars. You should be used to the cold weather in January seeing you\\'re from Germany and will have proper winter clothes with you. Everything else is good to go.\\nThis is a list of hotels that accept under 21\\'s to check in, with the lower age limit being 18 years old. You\\'re OK in that regard (check directly with any of the hotels you\\'re considering in case of changes due to covid):\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12592934-What_are_Age_18_hotels_and_hostels_in_Manhattan_and_LIC-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nSightseeing in January is a much quieter experience with less crowds. You might also want to plan lots of indoor time with a few outdoor sights. Museums are good and there are plenty in NYC. On a clear and sunny day things like Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge would still be lovely even if it\\'s cold. I highly recommend but when will you be 21? I\\'d wait until then just for the freedom of choice. If I was in Germany, 20 years old, and had the budget of a typical 20 year old then no I would not pick NYC as a first place to travel.\\nThere are several European cities that would likely be a lot cheaper flight, much cheaper hotels and while subjective I\\'d say no less interesting. Sure, but January is winter, so understand that and be prepared for a different type of trip than say now. While I can\\'t speak of the international components, I travel if NYC at least yearly solo. It is a great city if you are solo and I\\'ve never felt out of place here by myself. Doing my research ahead of time about transportation and making a plan really helped me when I started visiting the city. >>Just be aware that some hotels do not allow singles under 21 to check in.<<\\nWhat does single have to do with it? Yes I agree with others if you can wait until you are 21 that would likely remove some of the complications and make the trip more enjoyable since you will have more options. We are spending one or two nights in September and this hotel fits our budget and location desires. Unfortunately, there are no reviews of it on Tripadvisor which makes me nervous to book it. Does anyone know anything about it? Thanks. It\\'s a brand new hotel that might not even be open yet. Hence no reviews.\\nEven though you\\'re not going until September I would have a backup hotel just in case. I tried a dummy booking and no dates would work until late September. Sometimes hotel openings take longer than planned and they might have to put you up somewhere else. Hmmm, that’s strange. I just went to their website and tried to book a couple of nights in August and there was still availability. Where did you find out that it was a brand new hotel? Says accepting from August 27 and beyond:\\nhttps://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/new-york/hyatt-place-new-york-chelsea/lgazc Whenever I choose any date between now and end of September I get a message “this hotel is unavailable during those dates, please select another hotel below.”\\nIt suggest Hyatt House Chelsea which is different to Hyatt Place. I just read a TA thread on vacation rentals on TA--several responses said there is no guarantee of authenticity, that they could be illegal, that TA does NOTHING but post them. This is astounding to me...If this is all true, then TA is willing/not liable for being an accessory to a crime.\\nHas anyone had any experience with TA vacation rentals?\\nI found a 2 bed/2 bath in NYC for 6 nights; beautiful but no reviews available, has only listed it since 12/20. Doesn\\'t this sound pretty fishy to you? If the owner responds to me, I will definitely require some kind of authenticity and will discuss with my bank.\\nWould very much appreciate all comments and suggestions. If it sounds fishy, I’d trust your instincts.\\nDo you know the laws per short term rentals in New York City ? they’re complicated.\\nTA isn’t doing anything illegal posting them I believe, dont they tell you it’s up to you to figure out if there legal listing or not? So it’s all on you. I would give up the idea entirely.\\nAren’t you out and about most the time when you’re in New York City? In my I opinion nobody needs luxury but I know some people want luxury in Accommodations.\\nI would save yourself some stress and find a legal hotel that you can afford One with many reviews and is 100% refundable within two days of your booking. The majority of vacation rentals in NYC are illegal. Many are scams. It doesn\\'t matter if you find it on TA, Airbnb, etc.\\nYou need a hotel.\\nWhat type of \"authenticity\" do you think an unknown owner will give you? They can send you anything via the inter-web! Be aware that the majority of AirBnB Style short term apartment rentals are illegal in all of NYC\\nThey are illegal in any residential building with three or more units. The only potentially legal ones are in one or two family houses - which are uncommon in areas that are desirable or convenient for visitors https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/articles/liz-krueger/answers-new-yorkers-concerned-or-confused-about-illegal-hotel-law and https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/about-illegal-short-term-rentals.page\\nThe source of the offer does not matter - the legal classification of the building does. No internet middleman, even otherwise respectable or well known ones, vets listings for compliance with local laws, leaving visitors vulnerable.\\nThe internet middleman companies preferred to spend money on lawyers to make sure they are not responsible (beyond the occasional refund) and as far as they are concerned the responsibility is on the \"hosts\"\\nWhat sort of \"authenticity\" do you think could be provided?\\nUnlike SF, there is no registration / verification system. \"I just read a TA thread on vacation rentals on TA--several responses said there is no guarantee of authenticity, that they could be illegal, that TA does NOTHING but post them\"\\nAnd you\\'ll read the same thing again here. Nothing has changed. If it had a lot of reviews, it would still probably be illegal (if in Manhattan or the denser parts of the outer boroughs).\\nWith zero reviews, it increases the chance of it being an outright scam.\\nEdited: 10:02 am, July 23, 2021 No reviews is tough, I\\'d stay away from any rental that had no reviews.\\nBut here, there are so many hotels and most rentals are illegal. Sure, many are still engaging in that activity, but you\\'d be going down a long, dark road. There is a long history in NYC of phony rental scams -- both long term and short term. Sometimes people just grab the photos of an apt that is or was for sale and make \"for rent\" ads out of them.\\nI don\\'t know if it still happens often, but there used to be a scam where someone who had access to a vacant apt. would \"show\" it to multiple people, agree to rent it to all of them, take security deposits and first month\\'s rent from all, then disappear. On moving day they all would show up, then start screaming and calling the cops. Anyone know of any? Something with like a nice interior Are you planning to eat the scenery? Are you planning to dress up? Why must your restaurant be in Little Italy? NoLiTa (North of Little Italy) has some better Italian restaurants, if Italian is what you\\'re after. Even throughout Manhattan there are really good Italian restaurants. Little Italy is more a tourist destination. If you like that, no problem, maybe Da Nico is what you\\'re looking for.\\nNoLiTa has Pasquale Jones which is good. Rubirosa is often mentioned on this forum that has a good reputation. This can start you off with places to look at. Little Italy in Manhattan is not necessarily going to be the best Italian food in NYC. None of my favorite places are located there, but if that is the area you want to dine in hopefully this helps.\\nI will note that although I have not eaten there Aunt Jake\\'s opened a second restaurant in my area (their original location is in Little Italy) and people really enjoy it. It is on my list of places to try.\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/maps/best-restaurants-little-italy-nyc Geloso’s on Grand and Ferrara Bakery for dessert; Casa Bella, Paesano’s and Gennaro’s are all on Mulberry if you’re looking for something more ‘touristy!’\\nFor ‘Italian’ we prefer Villa Mosconi or Carbone’s in the West Village, or Bellini’s on the UWS! Patsy\\'s on 56th is also ‘fancy’ and a favorite! In Little Italy the restaurant with the most Ambiance ( not fancy, but cute ) IMO is Da Gennaro. Its on a corner and has good people watching. I’ve been to a couple other ones that were really boring and nothing special.\\nhttps://www.dagennarorestaurant.com/\\nIt doesn’t have the finest Italian food .. ( id call it Italian American ) or the great service, but it has a nice outdoor seating area & Specially nice on a Sunday. Pre covid the street in front was closed to traffic.\\nFor example, one time I ate there with a friend who wanted to eat in little Italy. This was our first time traveling together to New York. She had the ravioli and she said it was just OK, I had the seafood risotto it was a good dish of rice with lots of good well done seafood in it, but it wasn’t risotto, it was a nicely cooked white rice. . Why they tried to pass it off as risotto is beyond me. It wasent a bad night and we talked to some nice tourists from Houston who were pilots for American Airlines ( i think it was) and that was interesting. But, neither one of us have ever wanted to go back to Little Italy to eat again since. Although we do always end up walking through there and maybe getting a coffee or a pastry at Ferrara’s\\n. http://www.ferraranyc.com/ While the decor might not be fancy; this place certainly has history: - Benito One - http://www.benitoone.com/\\nMost of the Italian places I enjoy are on the Upper East Side. Similar to Benito One they make you feel as if you are in someones dining room/living room. A very homey feel.\\nEdited: 2:13 pm, July 22, 2021 I haven\\'t been to Benito One but reading reviews, people describe it as a hole in the wall. I don\\'t think that\\'s what you want although food sounds good.\\nThe first and last places on the list red posted are old school 50’s type places when dining was more formal, but neither is what I\\'d call fancy. Forlini\\'s became a fashionista hangout when Vogue rented it out in 2019. Not sure if it still is.\\nhttps://guestofaguest.com/new-york/restaurants/forlinis-the-old-school-italian-eatery-thats-become-the-hottest-spot-on-instagram My family of 8 girls will be NYC midtown Thanksgiving and would love to have a traditional Thanksgiving meal in the city. Any suggestions? Here is a discussion from the past. One would need to check that a particular restaurant is still in operation.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12943017-Thanksgiving_2019_in_NYC_What_to_Do_Where_to_Eat-New_York_City_New_York.html Good link in post # 1.\\nMenupages.com usually has a big Thanksgiving list of restaurants with their menu\\'s about a month out. You need to be quick when reserving a table at some restaurants so be willing to reserve as soon as you can. there are so many travel insurance companies out there wondering if anybody has used one for international travel with coverage for covid 19 that was good. Not sure if any company is good.\\nBefore pandemic I had travel insurance for a trip to brazil (scheduled to go after pandemic came) and when i called insurance company to cancel they said they did not cover pandemics!!!\\nso many articles online that list of top travel insurance companies, but different websites have difference top choices, so wondering if any one has actually used anything had covid and actually had to use it and if they covered for hospitalization or quarantine hotel costs and flight back. Maybe post this in a general travel forum or maybe the forum for the country you wish to visit. I know some policies cover different countries, so it always gets a bit tricky Many don\\'t cover pandemics unfortunately. (From Australia anyway).\\nSome airlines offer cancellation coverage if you have to cancel due to covid, but that was at the beginning of the pandemic, I\\'m not sure what has evolved now. They may just offer a travel voucher for a later date. Check what your airline says about cancelling due to covid restrictions. Health concerns overseas due to covid are a different matter. Visit or call insuremytrip.com. Tell them what you want. Are you looking for coverage for medical expenses you incur if you get COVID in another country? Are you looking for coverage if your airline cancels your flight because of a border closing? Are you looking for coverage because of quarantine expenses after testing positive on your way back into US? Are you looking for reimbursement of all your trip expenses after you just decide to cancel because you are nervous about another country\\'s rising infection rate? It all depends on what kind of coverage you are looking for.\\nNote SOME US insurers did cover COVID related cancelations last year -- but only for people who either (1) bought \"cancel for any reason\" (CFAR) coverage or (2) bought their coverage before a pandemic was declared on a specific date in mid-late Jan. 2020.\\nEdited: 8:05 pm, July 02, 2021 i was looking into a cruise from miami, carnival, cruise line does not offer travel insurance for new york residents!!! cruise is in august and goes to curacao, aruba, st thomas, bahama if i recall correctly.\\ni wanted medical coverage in case i got covid and had to be hospitalized, and also evacuation coverage if in a foreign country.\\nperhaps it is dumb to travel now, not even know why i bothered even looking one for august (MSC which got concelled in june 6 right after i made final payment may 22). still waiting for cruise line to let me know when i can get my refund, online says can take 90 days, so waiting until last minute to book cruise since airline offers only credit and no refund.\\nmy hobby is to travel, and was a fool to try to book a trip to have my money tied up. i guess i could travel without insurance, but would be dumb if i did and got covid even though vaccinated. It would also be dumb if you went and had a heart attack or slipped and broke your ankle -- unless your normal medical insurance would reimburse you for \"international incidents.\"\\nAnd it is dumb to think your insurance is limited to that offered by a cruise line. Actually it is not wise to buy trip insurance from a cruise operator, airline, tour operator or third party booking outfit, whose policies are generally designed to benefit them, not you.\\nGo on a website like insuremytrip.com, where you can compare policies from a number of different companies, and then call insuremytrip if you have questions. Also, read contract language on evacuations carefully. You don\\'t necessarily get flown home in an air ambulance just because you want to. The docs and insurance company generally have to agree that it is in your best interests. They could decide it\\'s not necessary, that a local hospital is sufficient for your needs. Hi all--\\nApart from the usual caveats about preferring first-row seats, not getting view of the whole stage, etc., I have a question on the side boxes in Parterre, Grand Tier, Dress Circle.\\nDo any or all have the anteroom with coat storage that the Center Parterre boxes have? Might be a nice perk in the winter not to have to wait downstairs for your coat. I am afraid only the parterre boxes have the coveted anterooms. These have self-locking corridor doors and an usher has to let you in each time you return. It is best not to leave without your ticket to verify you belong in the box. The red velvet anterooms have a small sofa and coat hooks. Boxes 1 and 2 lack the anterooms.\\nchrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metopera.org%2Fglobalassets%2Fseason%2Ftickets%2Fseat-map%2Fmet.seating.charts.feb2019.pdf&clen=2816365&chunk=true\\nEdited: 1:07 pm, July 23, 2021 Thanks.

Another thank you Nycforever. My vacation dates do not coincide with restaurant week but I am saving this post for my trip in September. My plans include Harlem. Im willing to drive up to 3 hours to see them. What are multiple locations that I could go and see the Perseid? Adirondacks, Thats the darkest spot in New York State (Its more like 4 hours not 3 to get there) We usually aim for a dark beach facing the right direction for meteor showers for unobstructed views to the horizon. The breezes keep the night insects away, too. CT shore might have some options For . best sky warching of any kind you need have clear skies & be away from any city lights. I might try the middle of Central Park if you can find a clearing in the foliage. A few years ago, NY adopted the Dark Sky Initiative that requires exterior lighting not to shine up in the sky. Seemingly every street light in NYC was replaced with recessed LEDs and I have noticed greater darkness when I look out the window. Still, stars are few to be seen. I agree with Fox. The general \"glow\" from Manhattan (and from New Jersey, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx are going to make seeing meteor showers from Central Park difficult. That plus the lack of a clear view to the horizon . . . This map shows light pollution ratings and will tell you the best spots to view the night sky.\\nhttps://www.lightpollutionmap.info/#zoom=8.72&lat=40.8925&lon=-73.9016&layers=B0FFFFFFTFFFFFFFFFF\\nDiane\\nNYC Photo Safari Hello everyone. In November a friend and I are coming to NYC for a Broadway show. We arrive into Newark around 1000, and plan on leaving our hotel in Times Square to visit the Stonewall Inn and surrounding area (in memory of my brother). I can Google how to get there on the metro, but to make best use of our very limited time what else should we see in the area? We both love history, art, bookstores. We come from a boring area of Ohio where good food is rare, so is there a really unique place to eat? No seafood though, my BFF won’t touch it, but we’re open to anything fun and exotic. Thank you!!! That is the heart of some of the best restaurants in Manhattan, at all price points. You may want to indicate your budget (in dollars, \"moderate priced\" or something like that has no meaning - \"moderate\" means different things to different people. Stonewall is adjacent to a cute little park worth walking in, interesting sculptures. Jefferson Market Garden, on the grounds of a former prison (among other things) with beautiful plant life is nearby. https://tclf.org/jefferson-market-garden. You will also not want to miss going to Washington Square Park, you will recognize the huge arch from many tv shows and movies, there are usually street performers of various types and a wealth of people watching. I believe my favorite bookstore on Bleecker is closed - I was there a few weeks ago, there were still books on the shelves and in the windows, but no signage was out when they are open.\\nBar Pisellino is kind of diagonally across the street (in view of Stonewall) on Seventh Ave, an Italian bar. Via Carota (same owner) is across the street on Grove St (next to Marie\\'s Crisis - if it\\'s open, you may want to check it out. Last I checked, it hadn\\'t reopened yet). There are a number of fun restaurants on nearby Cornelia St at various price points (including Tacombi for inexpensive tacos and Silver Apricot for modern Chinese), and Rosemary\\'s on Washington St is great. Morandi for good Italian (the lemon pasta is yummy) is not far. You can also check out Boucherie for French bistro or Taboonette for takeout middle eastern. https://taboonette.com/\\nIf none of those work for you, there are exactly (count \\'em) 14 gazillion restaurants in the immediate area.\\nYou will not go hungry in this area, or be bored. This is fantastic. Thank you so very much. Budget for food isn’t an issue. I will pay whatever for a good meal, but want to avoid anything on a Top Ten list, if you know what I mean. Want to eat where someone who lives in the area would eat. The walking tours here might be worth a browse for historical sites, etc https://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html Well, I eat at The Clam with some regularity but that won\\'t work for your BFF , obvs. But you can try The Little Owl, same owners. Or any of the restaurants I mentioned above. If you want more of a big deal Italian, try Il Cantinori - an oldie but still goodie. Or you can try Babbo, also an institution. While tourists may go to both, they are neighborhood restaurants to the locals, where people may be greeted by name. It also would be helpful if we know your food likes & dislikes. As for a budget for food, the reason we ask for a budget for food (& I would add would add per entree) is that it does no good for us to recommend a meal you can\\'t afford. Like Fraunces Tavern, the Stonewall Inn is a recreated historical site. The original place closed shortly after the notorious riot and the building was used for various things including a bagel shop, shoe store, and a Chinese restaurant. Taim is a counter service middle eastern for a casual falafel sandwich if you like that. There\\'s a couple of locations, the Waverkey Place one is in a very cute area.\\nKish-Kash is a little further but has house made couscous with meats and chicken and veges etc.\\nVia Carota is very good. If they have the tonnarelli caio e pepe pasta dish then I recommend that. They also had a delicious chicken dish.\\nBar Pitti is an Italian place known for celebrity visits in a very casual setting. Their blackboard specials are worth looking at. Pastas are very good.\\nAnd for sweet treats, Dominique Ansel bakery is very creative with some yummy treats. The Stonewall Inn has been remodeled so much that nothing remains of the 1969 interior.\\nCheck the narrow parklet outside the Stonewall Inn between Christopher St. and Grove St. It\\'s the Stonewall National Monument honoring those who fought for LGBT rights.\\nA block east of the Stonewall Inn at 15 Christopher and opposite the appropriately named Gay St. was the Oscar Wilde Bookstore, a fixture of LGBT books and literary events for decades. It closed about 10 years ago.\\nGo back toward Stonewall and cross 7th Ave. Walk along Christopher past Bleecker St. to Hudson St. Christopher from 7th Ave. to Hudson was the Main St. of NYC LGBT life in the 60s to 80s. There are still a few stores left from that era.\\nLeslie Lohman Museum at Wooster St. and Grand St. has LGBT exhibits. It\\'s about a mile south of Stonewall Inn.\\nNorth of Stonewall at W. 12th St. and Greenwich Ave. is the NY AIDS Memorial\\nHere are some lists of LGBT sites in NYC:\\nhttps://www.nycgo.com/itineraries/new-york-citys-lgbtq-landmarks/\\nhttps://www.nyclgbtsites.org These are all great suggestions. I appreciate the thought and effort. I will look into the places suggested. Just re-read your post - you said “fun and exotic”. Go to Llama San. It’s Sooo good! And it’s close to Stonewall. Really excellent, don’t know why I didn’t suggest above. My wife and I are driving from Michigan in late August 2021. We will coming in on a Friday afternoon/early evening and we need to know if it’s best to park near our hotel at a vallet garage or find a spot outside the city and either ride the ferry or subway/train into Manhattan….. Suggestions!? There is no one size fits all answer to this question\\nThere are several variables to consider to help you decide\\nDriver comfort\\nHow many days you need to park\\nProximity of your hotel to transit options for a reasonably convenient arrival / departure\\nWhether suburban parking + transit costs saves you a worthwhile amount of money\\nDeparture time and direction Where would you be coming from and where do you need to go after NYC? That will impact public transportation options.\\nI\\'ve taken a bus into NYC many Friday afternoons/early evenings and based on that I\\'d avoid driving myself at close to any cost and I\\'d want to take a train that was further out than the subway.\\nPerhaps traffic isn\\'t as bad as I\\'ve experienced now due to office work being down, I don\\'t know, but if you really want to drive in yourself trying to go mid-day rather that later would help. Traffic is really bad on Friday afternoons. Logically you might think that\\'s only leaving the city but in my experience it\\'s quite bad going in also.\\nEdited: 8:24 am, July 22, 2021 \"...and we need to know if it’s best to park near our hotel at a vallet garage or find a spot outside the city and either ride the ferry or subway/train into Manhattan\"\\nThis type of question comes up regularly and I\\'m always stymied by it. I started driving in Manhattan as soon as I got my license as 17 (grew up in NJ), so I never understood the fears. I also am not sure what you mean by \"best\". As someone who lives in Manhattan, I\\'ve parked my car in garages close to my apartment (wherever that was), the last garage being $525/month, which was pretty consistent across all of the garages in walking distance to my home. For me, as crazy expensive as that sounds, the whole point of having a car in the city is convenience, and if I have luggage or bags or whatever, I want to be able to walk the least amount with them.\\nFor a visitor, I never understand the idea of spending extra time parking in another location, schlepping bags to a different transportation method, and then having to get to a hotel with them. Obviously, I don\\'t do that in Manhattan. But when I drove all over Italy a few years ago, I found parking garages as close to my various hotels as possible, and the costs were just part of the costs (and inconveniences) of travel. With limited vacation time, I wanted to maximize touring, not garage-hunting. But others may have different goals and expectations. So the question of what is \"best\" really depends on what YOU mean by that. If you want my view of \"best\", plug in your hotel address to your GPS, and look for nearby garages and park in the closest one (WAZE has that feature). That\\'s my opinion of \"best.\" But if \"best\" to you includes a fear of driving in Manhattan, or includes an analysis of the least expensive option, then you need to provide a lot more details about that, including what highways you\\'re coming from, as there is no one way to enter Manhattan. Prior to a couple of years ago I never drove into the city, thought it was way too stressful. But we would come down and just stay overnight on a Saturday and driving just made things easier. Also we would arrive in Manhattan on a Saturday morning and leave on Sunday, midday. It was easy and honestly quick, we could make it from midtown to Albany in under 2.5 hours.\\nWith the pandemic, starting in September 2020 we have driven in exclusively for the half dozen times we have been to NYC, without incident and without an issue.\\nFast forward to this past Sunday to Monday, driving was a bear! It wasn\\'t anything remarkable, but just took a lot longer this time around.\\nAs for parking, I use bestparking.com and look for the lowest prices. But I agree with Risa, I\\'m not finding a cheap garage in midtown when I stay in the Financial District. I do a quick look for garages around my hotel, there can be quite a difference in prices for garages in a few block radius. I would drive to/as close to the hotel as possible and park there. I would never park outside of the city and lug my luggage to the hotel.\\nI also never get the apprehension that some have driving in NYC. Maybe it\\'s me. Friday evening typically means more traffic coming into Manhattan.\\nWhere is your hotel and how are you coming into the city?\\nIn my opinion, if you\\'re driving from Michigan, it makes no sense parking outside the city and adding another layer.\\nFind a garage near your hotel, Icon has a lot of locations, take a look:]\\nhttps://iconparkingsystems.com “Maybe it’s me”.\\nWell in that case, me too. ^\\nTotally agree.\\nAlso, when it is time to leave, you jump in your car....locally...and prepare for the drive home. If you park elsewhere, that is another trek with luggage. I\\'ve made the drive from Ohio before and parked at Weehawken and took the ferry in. I found that fairly simple and easy. It was $20 a day for parking. There were free busses waiting outside the ferry terminal. My hotel was on their route so it was easy with my luggage. If I drive to the city again, I would definitely opt to park there again as I drove in Manhattan once and vowed never to do it again! I would like to take advantage of Restaurant Week.\\nLooking for the best ambiance, decor and great food.\\nOpen to all cuisine suggestions but of all the Steakhouses on RW which one would be best: Morton’s, Benjamin’s, Ben and Jack’s? This are the only ones I saw with Wedge salad and Filet mignon options. I only see the $125 dinner menu for Wayan, anyone knows the $39 one? I can\\'t answer your question about the 3 steakhouses since I haven\\'t been to all 3. I noticed your other post about disappointing experiences with previous RW meals and I think most would agree with you. Given how difficult it was for restaurants during the pandemic, I don\\'t know whether this year is the best time to try again (although how bad can any of those steakhouses be for $39 !!??). The best RW meals I\\'ve had were in places that are either permanently closed or temporarily closed.\\nI think for the big 80th birthday meal, I\\'d pick something not on RW. We have lived in NYC for 50+ years and whenever we are celebrating a milestone (or have any excuse for a celebration) we like the Gramercy Tavern & Restaurant as it is one of our neighborhood favorites; it is a community “institution” with a tremendous LOCAL following at 42 East 20th Street and has excellent food and great wines, and even better beers. The Restaurant is a little more “dressy” than the Tavern. Reservations are recommended for the Restaurant, and the Tavern is usually first-come, first-seated.\\nhttp://www.gramercytavern.com/\\nCH I agree this may not be the best year for Restaurant Week. Also wonder whether someone\\'s 80th birthday is best time to try to economize. Note that the reopened Smith & Wollensky steakhouse has a more casual part called, I think, Cafe Wollensky, which you enter at back, off 49th St, and which may have more reasonably priced options, even if not on RW.\\nI have had only one memorable -- as in I can still remember what I had and how it tasted -- RW meal and that was the tastiest chicken I ever had at a now closed French restaurant. I have to second Whiz\\'s astute analysis. A steak restaurant that is normally well over $100pp doesn\\'t seem like a likely candidate for a GOOD RW meal. Also isn\\'t there a Morton\\'s in LA? Is it necessary to eat at Morton\\'s in NYC when you can do so at home? Would that feel special enough?\\nBest restaurant week meals I\\'ve ever had was at Milos and Il Cantinori. But that\\'s not steak, if that\\'s what you\\'re set on. Actually, the casual part of Smith & Wollensky is Wollensky\\'s Grill, not what I said. Not a fan of Restaurant Weeks in NYC or at home, for a regularly outrageously priced $39 6oz petite filet mignon, your getting mashed potatoes an iceberg wedge and a piece of cake … ok, maybe a little fancier but they’re not really giving you anything substantial, add on a baked potato for $8 or more and you’re better off ordering from the regular menu. Restaurant week is suppose to lure you to places you’ve never tried before, look beyond the fixed price fee it’s not always what it seems to be. Thank you all. Yes, certainly RE would not be appropriate to celebrate such milestone celebration. I was trying to get the recs for the birthday and the rest of the week in one post but I didn’t clarify. The birthday boy has never been to Morton’s nor lives in LA, that’s why I was looking at it as an option for one of our meals. :) If Steaks is what you enjoy most then these are fine. Some other places unique to NYC with great views are One Dine at OWO, Gigino’s Wagner Park (with views of the Statue of Liberty), and Central Park Boat House (Loeb Boathouse)\\nHave Fun! Of the three steak places, I would go with Benjamin\\'s. The bacon appetizer there is some of the best bacon I\\'ve ever had. Steak is perfectly respectable. No reason ever to go to a Morton\\'s other than you want a steak and that\\'s the only steakhouse, both your ankles are broken, you have no car or other transportations and its the only one within hobbling distance. Ben & Jack\\'s is ok too. None are in the upper tier of NYC steakhouses though.\\nDO NOT go to any of the RW places for the $125 option. At all of the restaurants that have that option, you would be hard pressed to spend that much on the regular menu. If you are willing to spend that much, there are so many better places. From the previously mentioned old guard Gramercy Tavern to brand spanking new spots like Joomak Banjum. Hello, we will be 6 of us flying into Newark. We will be touring everything in Manhattan.\\n1. Should we stay in Manhattan or Jersey City?\\n2. How hard is it to get from Jersey City to Manhattan?\\n3. Is it safe to do so?\\n4. ! have found that Jersey City is a little cheaper. However, I just need to know if this would be a big hassle. I found 2 rooms at the Hotel Edison. Would this be a better option?\\n5. I also have found the Hyatt Regency on The Hudson in Jersey City. Any advice on either hotel? It depends on how big the savings are. The best option is to stay in Manhattan. Factor in the cost to travel back and forth to New Jersey so you know how much your actual savings will be. Also factor in that once you are in the city for the day(if you stay in NJ), heading back to change for the evening/refresh/etc is another expense.\\nIf NJ is \"a little cheaper\", stay in Manhattan. Jersey City can be a viable option *IF* your hotel is in convenient walking distance to the PATH train (Similar to but separate from the NYC subway system . It runs 24/7 and costs $2.75/ride) Yes it\\'s safe. The hotel you mentioned is near the Exchange Place PATH station. https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/index.html\\nThe question is how much you might save and the value of your time.\\nIMO the convenience of staying in Manhattan and in easy walking distance of some sights is usually worth paying some extra\\nEdited: 8:20 am, July 10, 2021 depends on the savings, for $10 a night I would not, but for $50 I probably would stay in Jersey City. Its actully very close to Manhattan, 10 mins away. Its just an extra $2.75 train fare per person I stayed several times a few years ago at the Hyatt Regency in Jersey City. It was a good hotel with large rooms. It\\'s best feature is the amazing views -- the Hudson River, Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty. But it\\'s not cheaper than comparable hotels in Manhattan, especially when you add in the cost and the time required of travelling to and from Manhattan. I thought the hotel was quite nice, but recent reviews on Yelp have been mixed Well normally I would say stay in Manhattan. But the Edison is an old hotel that tends to get big tour groups and not that great while the Hyatt JC is a nice newer hotel where many rooms have great views of Manhattan. It is near a PATH train that takes you to Manhattan. The PATH is $2.75/ ride so for 6 of you, it adds $33/day to your costs. I would try to find something nicer in Manhattan.\\nBtw, are you saying you\\'d get 2 rooms in Manhattan but that Hyatt will sleep 6 in one room? I think it makes a difference if you have small children. With kids, it\\'s nice to be able to go back to the room midday to rest or change clothes etc. being in Manhattan makes that easier. Is your child who is currently living out on Long Island still a factor in your plans?\\nIf yes, have you comparison priced flights into LGA or JFK? Arriving in NYC gives you a different choice of airport transit options as well as the possibility of finding a good choice of hotel in convenient parts of Queens or Brooklyn Jersey City works if the savings is substantial.\\nStaying in Manhattan is typically the best route to go. Now seeing that you have a daughter on Long Island, this is a terrible idea. I agree with Kaye, you should try to fly into JFK or LGA. If that\\'s not an option, just stay in Manhattan. Has anyone been able to make a reservation for Momofuku Noodle Bar, specifically the uptown location? The website says reservations can be made 30 days in advance, but when I tried today, Resy only showed dates through Aug 3 as options, and none of those dates showed any openings. I’ve messaged them via their Facebook page, but haven’t gotten a reply yet. I can see that their website says they allow reservations 30 days in advance for their uptown location (Columbus Circle) but the system still doesn\\'t show availabilities that far in advance. It\\'s more like 14 days.\\nhttps://momofukunoodlebar.com/reservations/\\nAre you looking at a resv for 1 person? There are availabilities for dinner for 2 people all of the dates I looked at. This is an issue that annoys me as a solo visitor. You can book for 2 people but not for 1 person. When this has happened to me in the past I sometimes make a resv for 2 people on my chosen date and time then I contact the restaurant later to change it to 1 person. There has been no problem doing this.\\nI know with that Columbus Circle location it was never busy when I was there last, though that was when it was in the first few months of opening, so maybe it hadn\\'t established a clientele yet. Things could be different now.\\nThey say they welcome walk-ins, so this could be an option too if you fail to make a resv. I called the restaurant earlier today, and spoke with someone that was able to make the reservation for me! He was so helpful, and I had my email confirmation by the time I got off the phone! He couldn’t tell me why the system wouldn’t let me make the reservation online, but he said he was happy to enter it for me. Glad you sorted it out. Enjoy. This is long-sorry! Would love feedback on my projected itinerary. I will be traveling with my 3 daughters ages 17, 14 and 11 in late Sept. We like food, people, culture, shopping and outdoors and aren’t big museum or Arts people.\\nWhat am I missing? Is this realistic???\\nItinerary:\\nSat-fly in: Taxi to hotel-Roommates Grace; drop luggage and come back for check in, see Times Square-FAO, Melt or Adels Halal for lunch, Hershey/M&M, Bibble and Sip for an iced latte, walk past Rockefeller center, big city bus tour(btwn w 50/51st at 6th) 5:30-10pm-has a quick dinner stop, 20min tour thru Grand Central, Edge Obs(buy ticket)\\nSun morning/Afternoon-Central Park(SE corner) 9am-breakfast @Pick a Bagel, Central Park bike rental- 2 hour bike rental 10-12, The Rumble, Balto, lake, Strawberry Fields, the Belvedere Castle, do Roosevelt tram(use Metrocard), lunch-Junzi Kitchen or Urbanspace, Bryant Park, back to hotel to rest/freshen up\\nSun Evening-subway to Little Island(get timed entry),The High line, Hudson River Park, vessel, Chelsea Market for dinner or: Pisillo Italian Panini take subway back to hotel\\nMon-7am-check for 911 free tickets on website, later breakfast(10am)- Andrew’s Coffee shop or The Harold, Staten Island Ferry to see Statue of Liberty 11am?(runs every 30min, on the hour or half hour)grab lunch at the battery restaurants\\nMon afternoon/Evening:\\n2:30-911 memorial\\n3:30-911 museum(free tickets or prepurchased), walk Brooklyn Bridge, Dumbo, Brooklyn Park, eat on Brooklyn side, take east river ferry back to Manhattan, Uber back to hotel\\nDinner: Grimaldis, Juliana’s(pizza row/Old Fulton St), Spimoni Gardens**\\nTuesday-Greenwich/East Village- take subway to Washington Square station, quick breakfast-?, see NYU, see Grove St/Christopher area for homes, second hand vintage shopping tour thru Free Tours by Foot(10:50)-maybe?\\nLunch-In the Village or East Village: Paul’s Da Burger Joint, Rays candy, Molly’s cupcakes, Matchaful, Washington Square Park, head toward Little Italy/Chinatown to shop,\\nTues evening-head back towards hotel, low key dinner-??\\nWed-breakfast-??, check out(10am)leave luggage at hotel), subway to the Color Factory(11:15 tickets), lunch-?? by 1pm, subway or walk back to hotel, Uber to airport by 2:15, 4pm flight home Rather than walk the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, I would opt for the opposite. Take the ferry from Wall St./Pier 11 (an easy walk from the 9/11 Memorial) to DUMBO. Explore the Brooklyn side then walk back to Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset if possible. The views of the Manhattan skyline are beautiful. Agree with first reply and do know that you will be walking your bikes to every place on your Central Park hit list. None of these places are on the biking roads. Do you all do lots of hilly biking through crowds at home? Will let others deal with the rest of your itinerary but am eager to read your trip report. Saturday:\\n-What time are you arriving?\\n-I think Grand Central deserves more than 20 minutes.\\n-I think Times Sq has more \"pop\" in the evening.\\nSunday:\\n-This day is extremely busy. Extremely!\\nMonday:\\n-I usually advise people to budget 3+ hours for the 9/11 Museum. I have been twice and could have easily spent more time there.\\n-If you follow that advice, you won\\'t get into Bklyn until close to 8pm. I think DUMBO and the park is best seen earlier in the day...even in late Sept.\\n-Spumoni Gardens is nowhere near the DUMBO/Brooklyn Heights area so I would scratch that off of the list.\\n-Do know that the Photoville exhibit in the DUMBO usually starts in mid Sept so that may also be an option when you are in the area.\\nTuesday:\\n-There really isn\\'t much shopping to be had in Chinatown/Little Italy if you ask me. If you are looking for I Love NY and NYPD T shirts, then you can find that stuff there. I\\'d have a plan B for the HOHO bus. I\\' was taken by a friend on a HOHO bus trip when it was cool & fainy & both of us agree that it was a miserable experience. I’m no expert, but I have been there enough to know that I am just exhausted by reading your itinerary.\\nIt’s nice that you have tried to break everything down by time and are allowing yourself a certain amount of time, but I can promise you it’s not going to work out that way. Getting around the city is not like getting around in your hometown. It takes a while to get from one destination to another.\\nI do not recommend a HOHO bus. You will waste more time on that and hope that you can get a seat when it comes back around and pick you up. If there is nothing available, then you will have to wait for the next one. Very much a waste of time!\\nI’m speaking as a tourist and I think you are trying to cram in so much that you are not going to enjoy yourselves. I think you have WAY too much planned, especially on the last day. I was not familiar with the Color Factory so I looked it up. I lol\\'d when I read \" remind people what it means to slow down and be present.\"\\nThe faqs say it will take 60-90 minutes inside. But you plan to visit AND eat lunch between 11:15 and 1, then make your way back to the hotel, pick up your luggage, find a taxi/Uber and get to the airport by 2:15.\\nYou need to realize that you cannot always time everything to the minute. You want lunch at 12:15 ... it\\'s a busy time. Even if you go to McD\\'s it can take 15 minutes to get food. You get to your hotel, and there may be 3 other hotel guests waiting to pick up luggage too, so you wait your turn. Going to the airport, you might hit traffic. And so on and so on.\\nI think you have some great stuff planned, just too much. I know this is your first pass. Do not be discouraged, you\\'ll get there. It would help if you did this with your daughters. Find out what\\'s important to them. Do things you want to do and not because they come \"free\" with whatever pass you bought. While the bicycle rental might be in the south East corner of Central Park, most of the things you want to see aren\\'t. https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations Unless there is some disorder, it is the \"Ramble\" in Central Park. This is a natural area with winding paths. It is possible to get lost there, though some friendly New Yorker would likely point out the way. As mentioned, bikes are only allowed on perimeter roads where you can see little of the park. Only use the human-powered pedicabs with great caution and a full understanding of the price beforehand. They too are limited to the outer roads. Belvedere Castle is on the top of a steep hill and carrying a bike up there would be a real pain. We will be in Poughkeepsie, NY mid October and want to take the train into NYC to visit the Memorial. Have no idea which train to take, if we need to make a connection, etc. Would greatly appreciate help for these two Floridians who have never traveled by train in this region. Thank you so much! Take the Metro North from Poughkeepsie down to Grand Central. Then take the train/subway(4 or 5) to Fulton Street and walk over. Note that the Metro North is not the NYC subway. The arrival/departure times are pretty accurate. So you should be early to make sure you catch the train.\\nI was on that GC > Beacon(a few stops before Poughkeepsie) this past Sunday and saw at least 5 people left on the platform after running to catch the train. Info https://new.mta.info/\\nSit on the right side of the southbound MN train for scenic Hudson River valley views\\nPurchase MN tickets before boarding to avoid an on-board surcharge Also, you are REQUIRED to wear a mask on the Metro North and the subway regardless of vaccination status.\\nThere are several announcements on the Metro North and the staff will ask you to wear one. The subway is much more lax, but that should not play a factor ins earring one.\\nI believe that masks are also required at the 9/11 Museum.\\n(Just some additional info re travel and the museum.) Note that there are also long distance Amtrak trains from Poughkeepsie to New York (Penn Station.) But they\\'re MUCH more subject to delay than Metro North, have higher fares, and require advance reservations. Just don\\'t get on an Amtrak train by mistake if that\\'s not what you\\'re intending. Here\\'s info and a map of other things to see downtown https://downtownny.com/explore/plan-your-trip/must-see-downtown/ I\\'m just a bit confused by \"train/subway (4 or 5)\". Can you explain that in more detail, please. Also, we exit at the Fulton Street stop and then walk from there? Thank you! I\\'m just a bit confused by \"train/subway (4 or 5)\". Can you explain that in more detail, please. Also, we exit at the Fulton Street stop and then walk from there? Thank you! After you arrive at Grand Central, take the DOWNTOWN 4 or 5 subway/train from inside the complex down to Fulton Street. You don\\'t need to exit Grand Central to catch the subway/train. Just ask or follow the signs for the subway. You will need to purchase a Metrocard at GC or when you purchase your Metro North ticket.\\nWhen you exit at Fulton Street, look up and find the tallest building in the area(One World Trade). Head in that direction to the Memorial/Museum. Do give yourself some time to check out Grand Central either when you arrive or when you are leaving. Do look up and take in the ceilings. Walk around and just experience the amazing complex.\\n(If anyone needs to use the restroom after you arrive at Grand Central, they are located downstairs.) Where is the best place to park if taking ferry over to Liberty and Ellis Islands? I’m leaving from NJ Liberty Park. Is parking hard to find? How expensive is it. The entrance to the parking lot is on Audrey Zapp Drive, which runs along the northern edge of the park. If you look on Google maps, you\\'ll see it.\\nhttps://parking.com/nyc/parking-near/40.70943760/-74.04743830/?lot_id=12080 There is plenty of parking there, Its a decent sized park How can we travel to Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey from midtown Manhattan? We are two active women in our 60’s and will have one piece of luggage apiece and a backpack. Not sure exactly where you are going but you can take a bus from port authority to englewood cliffs. You could also arrange a car service. You can take the NJ Transit 156 bus from the Port Authority to Englewood Cliffs:\\nhttps://d2g63oyneaimm8.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/bus_schedules/T0156.pdf Thank you, red259. Do you have any hotel suggestions close to Port Authority? (Less than $250 per night.) There are a bunch of hotels on W40th, between 8th and 9th, but one or more of them may still be housing homeless people. I would avoid staying near the Port Authority. Having looked more into this area, I agree with you. Will someone pick you up there? A local cab could be expensive. It is not a compact town, it sprawls. Bus from PABT is frequent and easy, but may stop one mile from your destination, with no sidewalks, It is unclear why Englewood Cliffs is your starting point\\nPerhaps parking a car for free at the home of a friend or relative? If yes, ask them about travel options.\\nThe https://www.njtransit.com/ bus is probably the way to go. You could also look into having a car service take you down to one of the Hudson River ferry docks https://www.nywaterway.com/ferryroutesschedules.aspx (A memorable way to arrive)\\nOnce in Manhattan you can take a cab, transit and possibly even walk to your hotel. https://new.mta.info/\\nTo get hotel advice start a fresh thread with a title that will get the attention of the hotel experts\\nSpecify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired and 3) hotel budget. Kaye, I think you have it reversed. Maybe they\\'re coming to town via Manhattan, and then going to stay with someone in Englewood Cliffs. I would think whoever\\'s in Englewood would be able to give transit options though. Linda you may be correct . They did ask about transit to NJ but have also asked about Manhattan hotels. We are flying into NYC to spend a few days before we go to Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey to pick up my new car at Parkway Toyota, 50 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, NJ. (I am buying a 2021 RAV4 PRIME here because my state is not getting any allotments for this car.) Hi! My husband and I will be visiting NYC in late August. We are going to see Springsteen on Broadway and are planning to make it my 50th bday long weekend trip. Planning to fly in from Detroit on a Thursday and stay until Monday or Tuesday. I\\'m a little overwhelmed because there\\'s so much to do and see, but here are some ideas I had. Looking for input and help!\\nArrive on Thursday late afternoon. Get to hotel (not sure which one yet) and have dinner/relax. A friend recommended the Millennium on Broadway.\\nFriday early morning: Take a guided tour (6 hours) to see the main sights. Yes or no? Any particular company? Friday night: concert.\\nSaturday: Head to Jersey, Ocean Grove Beach, check out Asbury Park, Stone Pony, etc. Should we stay overnight in Jersey or is a full day enough?\\nSunday: Not sure, maybe more NYC exploring or another beach\\nMonday: open for ideas\\nWe don\\'t really care for museums, we are more into outdoor sight seeing and nature. I don\\'t want to drive anywhere so I will be looking at the MTA site to figure out how to get where we want to go. This is also a bit overwhelming but I have time to study it and figure out routes!\\nWe don\\'t have anything set in stone, except for the concert, so any input would be greatly appreciated! The things I know we want to see: Central Park, 9-11 Memorial, Brooklyn Bridge, Top of the Rock and/or ESB, Statue of Liberty, Coney Island, and spend time on a nice beach in Jersey and/or NY.\\nThanks in advanced for any input!\\nEdited: 2:39 pm, June 19, 2021 If you want to go to the Jersey Shore, Id recommend Long Branch . It easy to get to from NYC via NJ Transit or Sandy Hook which is accessible via a ferry that goes in NY Harbor (Ive never taken this ferry but the views should be awesome)\\nIf you want to go to a Long Island Beach, Id recommend Watch Hill on fire Island. Take LIRR to Patchouge and an amazing Ferry Ride to Watch Hill (for a one time trip Id recommend this because of the Ferry Ride)\\nId recommend the Little Island a new attraction and The High Line In the hot days of summer, we can get into a pattern of late afternoon thunderstorms. These often do not last very long, but you would have to seek an indoor area.\\nOcean Grove, and \"Beach\" is not part of its name, is noted for its many Victorian cottages, perhaps the most in the US. The town is very quiet with a two-block business district on Main Ave. and nothing along the boardwalk. Asbury Park is in the process of reviving and is very different from OG where alcohol is prohibited. It is a more \"hip\" place with more eateries and shops. However, it still has a ways to go and crime remains a problem. I am making a trip in early July and found the hotels in OG to be almost entirely sold out. Be sure to read the reviews of the hotels as some may not be up to your standards. I would add that Ocean Grove uses the same rail station as Asbury Park. The trip is about 2 hours with a transfer across the platform at Long Branch. Walk towards the front of the train at the station and turn left at the highway that runs into Main St. Ocean Grove is on the right (southern) side of the lake and Asbury Park on the Left. Cookman Ave. is the main business street in AP. The nicest houses in OG are in front of the Great Auditorium. You might hear the sound of the immense organ there several blocks away. There are also tents there as well that are picturesque. I admit to not being a big fan of Hop On Hop Off buses. I prefer van tours like OnBoard or High Quality. I’d say the two most time-consuming things on your NYC list are Coney Island and the Statue of Liberty (assuming you want to take the ferry to Liberty - and Ellis? - Islands themselves, and not just see the statue from a distance). The general consensus here is that to visit the statue, it’s best to book the first ferry of the day to avoid crowds/delays. I wouldn’t really know as (true confession!) I’ve never done it, and with tourist numbers still down, it may not be as big an issue these days.\\nConey Island is as (or more) fun during the evening as during the day, assuming your main interest is the rides and boardwalk scene rather than swimming on a very crowded beach. I mention that because it may help as you’re piecing together your itinerary. Depending on where you’re leaving from in Manhattan, it’s about a 45-minute to 1 hour subway ride to Stilwell Av. The good news is, the D, F and Q trains are all elevated much of the way (including spectacular views from the Manhattan Bridge on the D and Q, and a panoramic view of the city and harbor from the F), so you’ll have a birds eye view of south Brooklyn neighborhoods. I consider the subway ride a treat in and of itself.\\nRe: guided tours…I’m not a big fan myself, but it really depends on your travel style. I think just visiting the places you’ve listed - and walking around interesting neighborhoods - will give you a good taste of the city. But if you think you’d enjoy a narrated overview, then go for it! Monday, seeing you like outdoor sightseeing and nature, take a ride on the 5 minute ferry over to Governors Island. The ferry leaves from the pier on the left hand side of the Staten Island ferry and it\\'s only a couple of dollars.\\nGovernors Island is a little retreat from Manhattan with bikes for rent (the best way to get around and see everything), hammocks for relaxing, food carts, exhibitions, The Hill for 360 degree views of NYC, and guided walking tours (no tours on weekdays though).\\nIn fact, I would swap this to do on the Sunday so you can do a tour, and you can take advantage of the free ferry on weekends before noon.\\nhttps://www.govisland.com/ Thank you so much everyone for your help! I had not thought of the ferry right to the Statue of Liberty so thank you for that idea.\\nThese all are a big help in planning! It is not difficult to visit the top attractions in NYC on your own via mass transit. Easy to do it yourself at your own pace, so a tour is really not necessary unless you simply must use a tour. I note that you referred to Springsteen on Broadway a few times as a \"concert.\" It is most definitely not concert style, it is a one man show of Bruce telling his story, punctuated with his songs (and a cameo by Patty). Early in the run, he had to educate the audience that he does NOT want people singing along, it\\'s his performance (except at the end for Dancing in the Dark and BTR). If you\\'re expecting a concert, you\\'ll be disappointed, but I think it\\'s beautifully written and told, and I saw it 4 times (and will be going again). I cried every time, at least once. Perhaps read some reviews so you know what to expect.\\nI once did what you describe, drive down to Asbury Park to see some of the places he refers to in songs like Sandy and Tunnel of Love, and I\\'ve gone to the Stone Pony a few times. It was fun to do. You may want to check out what\\'s at the Stone Pony and other music venues around if you stay over.\\nYou may want to consider some walking tours, like Free Tours by Foot. https://freetoursbyfoot.com/new-york-tours/, choose a neighborhood. I wouldn\\'t want to be on one tour for more than an hour....you can easily self explore. A guidebook may help you. Or read other people\\'s trip reports on this forum for more ideas. Hope you are able to see the concert you are wanting to see. I am visiting New York as a tourist. I have researched and found an Airbnb that I checked is LEGAL (I am aware about New York laws). I am staying for over 30 days. I am staying at a place in Harlem which is at W 134th St. between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd. and Malcolm X Blvd. (Lenox Ave.)\\nI know New York and Harlem are safe in general. But is this specific street safe to stay in?\\nAlso what about the neighboring areas in Harlem. Are they safe to walk? Especially at night? (I should be back by 10 pm most of the days). Any streets I should avoid? I would not stay there, I would ask by private message (or perhaps he will see this) destination expert for NYC - Nycforever -he lives somewhere in Harlem or East Harlem.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newyorkcityforever?tab=forum\\nEdited: 11:45 am, July 20, 2021 It is safe.\\nNobody advising you otherwise lives in Harlem, and are likely offering you advice by stereotypes.\\nJust exercise basic street smarts, and you\\'ll be fine. Here is the official NYC crime map. If you set the map type to \"crime location map,\" the crime to say \"robbery\" and the time period of perhaps a year, you will find that the area in question is not particularly worse than the rest of Manhattan and better than parts of the Bronx.

Plan to Uber to my hotel (Doubletree Hilton Metropolitan), and either drop my bags or check in if my room is ready. I created a custom Google map to plot out places I want to go/see, to try and help logistically plan out my days, but trying to determine if having 1 main sightseeing/photo op day is best, or splitting it up into 2, and moving around my museum visits slightly. Here is how I initially thought of arranging my days. I\\'ve since tweaked it, and moved some things around, but would love any input on how to make the most efficient use of my time.\\nWednesday- (after getting to hotel)\\nMOMA (will reserve a time slot for around 2:30-3:00)\\nSt Patrick\\'s, Rockefeller Center, Times Square (photos/general sightseeing)\\nDinner-Joe\\'s Pizza\\nMagnolia Bakery for dessert\\nThursday-Main Sightseeing/Photo op Day\\nLeave hotel around 6-7am and take subway to Brooklyn and walk back across into downtown\\nStop by the 9/11 Memorial (just pools, no museum)\\nWalk up to the Ghostbusters Firehouse\\nBreakfast at Dominique Ansel Bakery\\nFriends apartment building\\nWashington Square Park\\nFlatiron Building\\nKleinfeld\\'s-just a photo from outside\\nStarbucks Reserve/Chelsea Market-may grab lunch there, depending on the time\\nSubway up to the MET (will reserve ticket for 1pm)\\nDinner at Jacob\\'s Pickles\\nDessert at Levain Bakery to take back to hotel\\nFriday-\\nBreakfast at Ess-A_Bagel\\nWalk up 5th Ave (need to drop off jewelry at TIffany\\'s to be cleaned)\\nLunch at Halal Guys food truck\\nNeue Galerie (really only to see the Woman in Gold)\\nGuggenheim\\nWalk through Central Park\\nDinner at Momofuku Noodle Bar\\nSaturday-\\nGrab bagels from Ess-A-Bagel to bring home\\nLeave for airport around 1030-11\\nFlight home from LGA at 1\\nAfter thinking about it, I am considering splitting my sightseeing on Thursday, and doing some on Wednesday when I arrive, instead of going straight to MOMA, and moving my visit to MOMA to Thursday (late morning).\\n2nd Itinerary Option:\\nWednesday-\\nAfter dropping bags at hotel, walk to Grand Central and ride down to the Friends apartment\\nLate lunch at Little Owl (saw it recommended on here, and it sounds delicious!)\\nWashington Square Park (photo op of the arch)\\nFlatiron Building\\nKleinfeld\\'s\\nChelsea Market/Starbucks Reserve\\nWalk up the High Line\\nDinner at Joe\\'s Pizza or Shake Shack\\nTimes Square (just for the obligatory pic)\\nDessert at Magnolia Bakery\\nThursday-\\nSubway to Brooklyn, and walk back to downtown\\nWalk to Ghostbusters Firehouse\\nBreakfast at Dominique Ansel Bakery\\nSubway back to Midtown\\nMOMA (opens at 1030am)\\nLate Lunch at Halal Guys\\nGuggenheim (closes at 6pm)\\nWalk back through Central Park\\nDinner at Momofuku Noodle Bar\\nFriday-\\nBreakfast at Ess-A-Bagel\\nSt Patrick\\'s, Rockefeller Center\\nShopping (Tiffanys, mainly)\\nNeue Galerie\\nMET (closes at 5)\\nDinner at Jacob\\'s Pickles\\nDessert at Levain Bakery\\nMy Saturday would be the same, either way\\nI\\'m well aware that it\\'s a TON of walking, and I\\'m fine with that-being on my own, I can move fairly quickly from place to place, and if I get tired, I can always drop some things from my sightseeing list. Museums are the only non-negotiables.\\nIf anyone has any suggestions to make the best use of my time, please advise! I\\'m really just looking forward to 3-4 days all by myself! My job is spent talking on the phone for 8 hrs a day, so being alone in the city, and not having to talk all day sounds like heaven right now!\\nSo sorry that was such a long post! Both options are extremely busy to me. Especially Thursday, there is a lot of walking involved and it all takes time.\\nWhen you plotted it all on google maps did it give you timings to get between each place?\\nYou might want to investigate the public buses to get around as well. It will save your feet (sometimes it\\'s the same amount of time as walking but it saves your energy) and is included in the metrocard. Hi Aynat, yes-I entered stops on the map 2 at a time to get the distance between them, and most seem to be about 10-15 minutes apart (walking) from each other. But I\\'ll definitely look into buses if my feet tell me to! A friend of mine looked at my initial Thursday setup, and said her feet were tired just reading it! I tend to over-plan when I travel, and usually end up dropping something along the way. I\\'m planning on starting really early on Thursday, either way, so I can slow down if I need to. Another thing to remember is you do a lot of walking at museums as well. Even if you sit down for a while your feet can still get tired. The you have to walk to the next destination.\\nGood idea to plan to drop things on the day if you do get tired or overwhelmed. Make a list of your \"Must do\\'s\" and stick to those, and anything else will be a bonus.\\nThis is a map of the public bus routes. The crosstown buses are a godsend sometimes when the subway doesn\\'t cover the route.\\nhttps://new.mta.info/map/5391 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum posting guidelines with prohibiting self-promotional advertising or solicitation.\\nWe ask all of our members to keep their forum messages free of self-promoting advertisements or solicitation of any kind - members affiliated with any tourism-related business should not include commercial contact information or URLs in their forum messages.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 2:50 pm, July 28, 2021 I have nothing to add with your itinerary, its been too long since I visited. BUT I have been solo and I am planning a return trip in 3 months also solo. Enjoy! it\\'s the best city to just do what you want when you want! I agree too that you tend to move faster while alone but definitely wear comfortable shoes! IT sounds like the taxi rans are back terminal side at LaGuardia. If that is the case, then I would take a taxi and not bother with Uber. I have rarely had long lines. It was a bit inconvenient when you had to ride a bus to get your taxi, but on the positive side you were virtually out of the airport by the time you got in the taxi so the charge was lower. I think that in general, the taxi is actually the cheaper option in NYC from LaGuardia.\\nI do agree with everyone that you have a packed visit. You can come visit again sometime. :) I map out my itineraries on Google Map as well, however, I usually double (even triple) the walking times between 2 locations to take into account foot traffic and just general stop and go because I see something shiny in a store 😁 (I travel solo as well so I can stop anywhere anytime I want) I appreciate all the advice so far! I\\'ll rethink things and try and reorganize my days. With my only non-negotiables being museums (MOMA, MET, Guggenheim), are there any suggestions on how to best organize the rest of my \"wants\" to see as much as possible? Brooklyn Bridge can be scratched, as I\\'ve done it a few times before. While the Neue Galerie isnt necessarily a priority, I\\'d like to see The Woman in Gold. I was thinking I could combine it with the Guggenheim, and it wouldnt add too much time to that part of my day.\\nI tend to \"hit the ground running\" on my city vacations, and don\\'t spend much time just relaxing (I can do that at the beach!) My other trips to NYC, I\\'ve averaged walking around 8-10 miles a day, and I naturally walk pretty quick. I\\'m definitely more of a \"I\\'ve got places to go and people to see\" type walker! I\\'ll meander through Central Park, but other than that, I\\'m on a mission!\\nEven though I wont be in the city for a full week, I plan to go ahead and buy the 7-day unlimited metro card, just to make things easier, so if I need to jump on the subway or a bus to rest my feet, I\\'ll be covered.\\nI have tentative plans to be back in early 2022, but it will be a different type of trip, and the people I\\'ll be with don\\'t necessarily enjoy the same things I do (we\\'re mainly coming back for Broadway shows), so I would love to check off as much as possible on this trip while I\\'ll be by myself. Tried to edit my last post, but it timed out. Having been to the MET and MOMA before, I have an idea of how long it will take me to see each of them. I budgeted about 3-4 hrs for the MET and about 2-2.5 hrs for MOMA. You could certainly combine the Guggenheim with the Neue Galerie especially if the NG may just be a quick visit (but I bet you stay longer because of the other paintings and items on display). Make sure take a good look at the Mada Primavesi painting as well (a young girl), it should be near the Woman In Gold. It\\'s much better than in pictures and the face is very real. Her stance is very much like the Fearless Girl down in the FiDi.\\nAllowing 3-4 hours for the Met and 2.5 hours for MoMA should be fine, some people spend less while others spend more.\\nA tip when planning is to have one big sight then one or two smaller sights, each day. So a big museum and then something smaller or outdoor sights will work. Eg a big museum then Central Park.\\nSince you know you\\'ll be back in 2022, there\\'s no need to panic if you miss something this time. My husband and I have booked tickets at the early show of the rescheduled (twice) show \"Charlie Parker Centennial\" at Birdland. I have read on TripAdvisor reviews that the food is not good so we plan to eat early (it is a 7 pm show). We want to get good seats, and the seating is first come first serve. I have also read that queueing is confusing and some ticketed people waited in line with people who had no tickets so they missed the first 10 minutes of the show.\\nWhat is the seating like? (Not interested in bar seating.) Are they all round tables on the floor?\\nHow early should we plan to get in line to have a good chance at a close table? How do you tell the difference between lines for people with tickets and those without? Any other tips? Seeing no one has answered, I,ll tell you what I think...it,s been some time since I was there...\\nI\\'ve seen both round and square tables. (Google photos inside Birdland Jazz). Don\\'t ever stand in a line in NYC without asking someone in charge what it\\'s a line for! You can stand in the line while your husband checks or vice versa. \"Don\\'t ever stand in a line in NYC without asking someone in charge what it\\'s a line for!\"\\nThat\\'s absolutely hilarious. Reminds me of the silly minor plot point in the Gilmore Girls reboot, about New Yorkers who will stand in line for anything (ummm, no, we won\\'t...that\\'s the visitors). I was there for a very early show (5pm I think) on the main floor in March 2019. Seating was first come/first served but not a free-for-all.\\nWe got there about 20 minutes before the doors opened and waited in a short line. When the doors opened people were checked off a reservation list. We were just 2. Then seating options were briefly discussed with a hostess and we were walked to a table.\\n(A nearby table was set for a group of 10 or 12, that group clearly went directly to their table with no discussion.\\nThere is a section of tables on the floor. Then there is another section a step or above that with a rail I think. Our table was on the raised section at the rail. We loved it because we could see the performers. Acoustics were good there, too.\\nHave fun!\\nEdited: 2:16 pm, July 20, 2021 I\\'ll be headed to NYC in September for a quick overnight trip (fly in Tuesday, fly out Wednesday) to see a couple shows. Originally, we booked a flight leaving EWR at 8:10, so we felt comfortable buying tickets to the 2pm performance of Little Shop of Horrors. The show is 2 hours and would let out in time for us to be on a 4:30 train out of Penn Station, plenty of time to make our flight. Even the 5pm train would be fine.\\nWell, that flight has been cancelled. We were moved to a 3pm flight and are looking to change. Our options are a 7:35 out of LGA, 7:25 out of JFK, or 6:55 out of EWR. These are the latest flights out of each airport that will get us home (we both have to be at work Thursday).\\nCan we make any of these if we are on 43rd street at 4pm? We shouldn\\'t have trouble getting out of the theatre, we bought aisle seats and it\\'s a very small venue. We don\\'t need to stop to grab luggage or anything.\\nWe are not concerned about cost. If taking a taxi to an airport will be the best/fastest option, we will pay what we need to pay, but I\\'m not sure that\\'s really a good option at 4pm on a weekday. Google maps and the citymapper app say we should be able to get to either LGA or JFK by 5:30ish via public transport. Is it too risky? Let\\'s say we don\\'t get there til 6 - is that cutting it too close? I\\'ve only ever experienced EWR security lines, which were horrible at noon on a Monday pre-Covid, but beyond that I have no experience with NYC airport TSA.\\nIf you were in our shoes, which flight would you pick, or would you abandon the whole thing? We desperately want to make the show work, we are starved for live theatre and have really been looking forward to this.\\nThanks! I would take the LGA or JFK flight as those airports are closer and the flight times are not all that different. One thing I would do is pack your bags, check out of your hotel & ask the bell captain to hold your bags (note, there may be a charge for this.) One thing that might be helpful is where your hotel is located (near what intersection) so that you minimize cross town travel. Thanks. We will actually not need to stop at the hotel. We\\'ll just have small backpacks and can head straight from the theatre to the airport. So I don\\'t have any worries about that eating time. Just trying to determine if 3.5 hours from door of the theatre to takeoff will be a long enough window. I would go JFK. Just go to Penn station and take the train to Jamaica and hook up to the air train. I wouldn\\'t mess with taxis during rush hour. You also got the added 30 minute time buffer over newark. Are you certain you\\'ll be allowed into the theater with your backpacks? I\\'d definitely confirm this with the theater in advance (preferably in writing so you can bring it with you.) Is the LIRR more dependable/less risky than taking the E to get to Jamaica? LIRR is a faster ride than the subway and you can check the schedule online. To save time, you can download the app and pre-buy tickets. LIRR won\\'t be as crowded. You could also take the LIRR to Woodside (closer than Jamaica) and get the Q70 bus to your terminal. I\\'ll double check with the theatre about max bag size. Obviously haven\\'t brought one in post covid but I\\'ve never had an issue before\\nIsn\\'t the Q70 for LGA, not JFK? I\\'m not opposed to a bus but wouldn\\'t it hit the same traffic a taxi would? 7 train to 74th St - Q70 is for LGA\\nLIRR / Aitrain is for JFK Yes, LIRR to Woodside and then the Q70 bus is the route to LGA, not JFK. There are fewer terminals at LGA so less time potentially circling the airport and Woodside is a slightly shorter LIRR ride than Jamaica. I\\'m planning on coming into the city on Wednesday with a friend for the day and have an early dinner with my daughter who\\'s in town from the pacific northwest. We\\'ll take metro north from CT and head to Chelsea for lunch and then visit Little Island and maybe a bit of walking neighborhoods and shopping. Looking for an indoor (AC option) for a couple of hours. We\\'d love to visit a museum but most all, including the Whitney, seem closed on Wednesdays now. Any ideas? -Moynihan train station\\n-Check out the Oculus\\n-The library on 5th Avenue\\n-Peruse the Essex St Market MoMA is open on Wednesdays.\\nhttps://www.moma.org/visit/\\nEdited: 3:02 pm, July 19, 2021 Also the New Museum\\nhttps://www.newmuseum.org/visit\\nAnd the Morgan Library and Museum\\nhttps://www.themorgan.org/visit Wonderful! I knew I\\'d get some suggestions here. I adore the Morgan and have been there many times and didn\\'t realize MOMA was open on Wednesdays. But I completely forgot about the New Museum and that\\'s somewhere neither of us has been. And I\\'d love to get a look at the new Penn train station if there\\'s time. Thank you all! The Natural History with its new gems and minerals display is open on Weds., but one has to reserve a time slot beforehand. This may be out of the way for you.\\nhttps://www.amnh.org/plan-your-visit Gems & minerals sound fascinating but I do think we\\'ll spend what time we have further downtown. Same with the City Museum of NY which is also open but much farther uptown. The weather is looking pretty unsettled so we might be seeking more indoor activities. Other suggestions welcome! Something like small like Intl Center of Photography.....spontaneously discovered that and loved it. I\\'ve been researching this too for my upcoming trip. Possible museums for a Wednesday include Fotografiska, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Queen\\'s Museum. You could also do the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Museums as well. Just looked up Fotografiska which looks super cool! I\\'ve never even heard of it. I love the NYC panorama at the Queen\\'s museum but too far afield for my short day in the city but you should go. I\\'m planning on parking on Lexington Ave near 87th to take subway to a Yankee night game on the 4 train. The parking signs on Lexington in that area say 2 hour parking 10 am to 7 pm. If I park my car there at let\\'s say 5 pm and pay for 2 hours parking, will my car be ok if it then continues to stay there until let\\'s say 11 pm? I always thought that once you pass the \"paid meter time\", i.e., 7 pm, you could still park there and after 7 pm, it\\'s free. I just wanted to make sure that\\'s the correct interpretation in NYC. Thank you. Just make sure you read the signs carefully. No one who has a car in NYC gets away without getting a ticket from time to time for failure to read every sign. They’re designed to mess you up I think! But a regular sign that has hourly parking between certain hours is fine to park after those hours. Will do Risa. Thanks again. \"Just make sure you read the signs carefully. No one who has a car in NYC gets away without getting a ticket from time to time for failure to read every sign.\"\\nGreat advise and absolutely true.\\nAs a car owner in Manhattan; I have seen my share of parking tickets.\\nTo the OP: a good back up option is parking in an area of alternate parking. This way you do not need to worry about the meter and/or if you cannot find available metered parking.\\nYou usually will find alternate parking streets around 86th street and Lexington avenue on the residential streets.\\nDuring the summer months I have found parking to be easier. Many locals have left the city for the summer. Especially, on Thursday, Friday and the weekend.\\nEdited: 2:59 pm, July 19, 2021 What does alternate parking mean and how would I know I\\'m in that zone? The signs say things like, \"No parking this side of the street 8 a.m.-11 a.m. Monday Wednesday Friday.\" It\\'s ostensibly to allow street cleaning. Opposite sides of the block will have different parking restrictions.\\nOne good approach is to look for blocks which will become illegal the next morning. There\\'s somewhat less demand for those spots. In the Upper East Side neighborhoods just mentioned there are a lot of private schools, where parking is often banned until 4 p.m., and then again beginning the next morning. Anything that\\'s past the \"illegal\" time where the ban begins early the next morning are also good places to look. Some of these zones may be only part of a block, while \"alternate side of the street\" rules are normally for the entire block. The Street Cleaning rules (AKA Alternate Side of the Street parking) covers most of the city https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01026\\nIn that area you might cruise the residential side streets for a spot as well In Manhattan (currently) you need to move your car to the other side of the street. This is to allows for street cleaning. This usually occurs on Thursday and Friday MORNINGS. Thus alternate parking.\\nTo identify the alternate parking streets; the signs on the residential streets will say \"no parking\" between specific morning hours.\\nSo basically on the alternate parking street if you find parking AFTER the \"no parking\" hours (usually mornings); you are free to park.\\nHere is more information\\nhttps://www.spotangels.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nyc-street-parking/ Hi, Has anyone stayed here recently with Kids? How big are the rooms and how safe is the area in the middle of the night? Our flight lands around 12 so we will be checking in at 1am. I like the hotel considering the location. In the absence of any direct feedback, have you taken a look at the recent reviews?\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g60763-d23155544-Reviews-M_Social_Hotel_Times_Square_New_York-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThe latest one from July was not very good and that was a family group. However, most of the previous reviews are Excellent. It can also depend on your own tolerances when travelling as to whether a hotel is to your liking or not.\\nYou can also ask questions directly on the Q&A page.\\nYelp also has reviews: https://www.yelp.com/biz/m-social-times-square-new-york\\nRoom sizes seem to be large for NY standards. 25sqm / 280 sqft is pretty good for a room in NYC.\\nOn your arrival I would be taking a taxi straight to the hotel, that will be safe and the sooner you get there the sooner you can all sleep.\\nThe location is quite good, not right in the TS madness but you could walk there. You could also walk to many other midtown sights and up to Central Park. There are a couple of subway lines nearby which is ideal.\\nEdited: 6:31 pm, July 19, 2021 One thing I would also suggest seeing that you\\'re arriving so late, make sure the hotel knows the time you will be arriving and to make sure they keep a room for you. If you don\\'t they may think you\\'re a no-show due to the late hour and cancel the whole reservation. Hello, have anyone stay at the hi hostel and is it a fun place to stay? Can it be dangerous?I believe I want to stay here because of the cost. With this place, I could stay 2 to 3 days in new york. I have never been there, but its been recommended many times in this forum. The HI is in a reasonably convenient location. However, due to covid, you should make sure you are comfortable with a dormitory style accommodation and their reduced activity programming https://www.hiusa.org/find-hostels/new-york/new-york-891-amsterdam-ave\\nAnother budget option to look at are the YMCA guest rooms https://ymcanyc.org/guest-rooms Private rooms, most with shared bath (Westside first choice for walkability and transit access) Someone may post here who has stayed at HI NYC Hostel ,but it’s a little unlikely.\\nI appreciate you wondering if it’s safe.\\nYou should ask this question on the HI New York City Hostel TA page.\\nAnyone who has left a review for this hostel will be notified of your question.\\nlook for the Q & A part on the page to ask your question there, it’s worth a try.\\nAlso scouring the reviews of the hostel on TripAdvisor may give you some insight.\\nUsing the keyword box on reviews helps too, I would put in the word “dangerous” all the reviews that use that word will come up.\\nTA page:\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d121994-Reviews-HI_New_York_City_Hostel-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nEdited: 3:06 pm, July 19, 2021 HI is the new name for Hostels International which is a group of hostels that are locally run. I used to be associated with the hostel here in Syracuse (alas no longer in operation) but it is no means a fly by night operation as they have been around for literally decades. I\\'m not endorsing this particular hostel but the organization itself is OK. I will state that it is indeed dormitory style sleeping & they may require bringing your own bedding. @ 4 Actually it is not *only* dormitory style accommodations, they do have private rooms offered with bath in hall where you pay for the entire room. And a private room with a en suite bathroom as well at HI New York City Hostel.\\nThe former name was hosteling international New York.\\nBut I believe Anthony is looking for the lowest cost room which is indeed the dormitory style.\\nEdited: 4:15 pm, July 19, 2021 Covid case numbers are rising here as they are in like 47 other states. Probably best to pay the extra money for a private room over a dorm even if fully vaccinated and would be pretty much insane to be staying in a dorm if you are unvaccinated. If I remember correctly, HI is poster SariChile’s go-to place to stay. I’m not sure how often she checks the forum these days, but you might want to search for some of her past posts (which would of course be pretty-pandemic), or even shoot her a direct message.\\nAnd, as already mentioned, look for recent reviews. HI, Whats the best way to reach Manhattan hotels after we land at Newark on a Thursday evening? We will have luggage and 8 yrs old kids. Can we take Uber from airport? Whats the cost now? You can take an Uber. Best is to open your Uber app and plug in date and time and start and end destinations and see what it estimates…or open it on same day of week at the time you will arrive and put in Newark airport and your destinations. Uber fees vary depending on time of day. Also, if it is raining, the fees will go up.\\nYou can also try a car service like Carmel or Dial 7. They will have fixed fees. A car service works well because you know the cost up front. But doing what Risa suggested is a good idea, see what an uber costs and then compare. I would book a car service such as Carmel or Dial 7. Uber/Lyft can be super unpredictable. A few weeks ago, I needed to go to Newark airport from Midtown Manhattan. Lyft showed me $194. Also, with construction, the traffic is horrendous as compared to before. About three weeks ago I flew into Newark for the first time. Got in the taxi line and had a very pleasant trip to Tribeca around 3:30p. I think it was about $65.\\nEdited: 1:07 pm, July 19, 2021 Hi everyone,\\nThis forum is very helpful..thanks for all your kind and prompt responses. I’m planning a trip to NYC soon with my three kids, all spread out in age. Doing research, I’m thinking of staying in the Midtown area. I want to rent a car to get from the airport to the inner city and in case I need it throughout the trip, but is it a waste of money? I’ve never taken public transportation in a big city with my kids and I’m nervous as to how it works or if it’ll be worth the hassle of driving. I’d imagine parking anywhere is a nightmare and one of my kids is too small to walk far distances. I want them to experience the most they can and visit many sites, but I’m scared I’ll lose time trying to find out the transportation! Any help or suggestions appreciated! Do NOT rent a car if you\\'re only visiting New York City! Not worth the money for the car, nor for the parking. Very inconvenient and very expensive.\\nIf you\\'re on a laptop, you\\'ll find a bunch of helpful topics in the right hand column. One is \"How Do I Ride the Subway (UPDATED)?\" Read through the information there and you\\'ll better understand how the subway system works. I live in a very small place, nowhere near a subway system, but I\\'ve used the system in NYC a LOT and it is easy enough - easier if you\\'ve prepared and read some about it advance. Forgot to add. Take a taxi from the airport to your hotel. Or a car service. Thank you SO much! I’ll look for that post & into car service! \"I want to rent a car to get from the airport to the inner city and in case I need it throughout the trip, but is it a waste of money?\"\\nIt\\'s a waste of both vacation time and money\\nRental costs, tolls, parking costs ($40/50+ day and high costs for short periods if you move your vehicle) and likely oversize charges if you need a vehicle that can accommodate 5(?) plus child seats\\nTerrible slow traffic and, since most parking is valet only, time wasted dropping off and waiting to retrieve your vehicle Do not rent a car, that would be a huge mistake. If you do not want to use the subway or busses, you can certainly take taxis, just be prepared for that cost.\\nWhat attractions do you plan on visiting? Things are spread out here and there is no one location that will work if you want to see attractions that are not clustered together. How long do you plan to visit for? Have you decided on a hotel? How old are the kids? \"Spread out\" could mean 1-9 or 12-23? For car services to and from the airport, Dial 7 and Carmel are two reliable companies. The VERY last thing that you need in NYC is a car.\\n-As already stated, take a taxi/car service from the airport to your hotel.\\n-Use public transportation to get around.\\n-Are any of the children teenagers? If so, they can probably figure out the subway system. Put them in charge. I would like to visit Central Park, 9/11 memorial, Statue of Liberty to name a few. It’s a 4 day trip. One of my kids is a teen, so I’m sure it won’t be impossible to figure out the transportation in a large city, but it’s stressful to think about and definitely something I’m trying to plan in advance. Hi, I\\'m planning to visit NYC for about 3 days and wondering what are thoughts on the OMNY and it is working as advertised. I\\'m planning to be on uptown, downtown, and long island city (also the tram).\\nDo I still need to get a Metrocard or will I be able to get through just using Apple Pay for OMNY? Thank you OMNY is still not available for 7/30 day unlimited rides. Other than that it is working as advertised. Yes if you are just paying per ride OMNY is working just fine. Does OMNY work for multiple riders like the pay-by-ride card? I was planning to get a single card for me and my kids, but maybe OMNY would be better??? #3 - Yes\\nhttps://omny.info/faq/how-omny-works \"The same pass-back rules that apply to MetroCard also apply to OMNY. You can tap and pay for yourself and up to 3 additional riders with the same payment method on a single trip. You will need to tap your payment method for each person that is riding with you. Each tap will result in a full-fare charge. Each person will also be eligible for free transfers.\"\\n(No opinion on if it\\'s better.)\\nEdited: 6:55 am, July 19, 2021 Thank you, Kaye! It definitely looks like it would work well for us. I already have at least one contactless bank card, so I should be good to go. I enjoyed using it. Sad you can\\'t use it on the LIRR transfer from JFK. Also wish they had a daily/weekly cap like they do in London. #6 - When the system is fully implemented that will be an option https://omny.info/system-rollout\\nIn 2023 when it is complete Metrocards will be eliminated and a card you can buy and refill with cash is going to be available for the unbanked and Luddites Hi, We plan to travel with 8 yr olds in Sep. I can\\'t decide which neighborhood should we get the hotel in? We want to do usual touristy things like empire state, central park, Times sq, Rockefeller so I want to stay in an area which is walkable for most destinations. (I know not every place will be). Which neighborhood will be more central? Because Manhattan is a long thin island, there is no one good area to stay in as attractions are spread out all over the place. We can help if you will give us your exact dates of travel (hotel rates vary by day), budget including 15% tax, desired bedding configuration & some of the things you look for in a hotel stay (like a modern hotel or an older, more classical vibe. There is no one central location, attractions are spread out. But, based on your list of attractions you want to visit, you could easily stay in midtown and be able to walk to the attractions you\\'ve listed. It would be best if you consolidate your questions into your other threads since you pretty much asked this already and got some good replies. :)\\nBecause my kids really loved things at Rockefeller Center, we often stayed in that area. But, we branched out to the Upper West Side and I think that\\'s where we will stick for the time being. There are more people out and about around the UWS than the hotels close to Rockefeller Center (though the exact hotel will dictate the reality of your experience). We had to walk a block of office buildings which were super quiet in the evenings and that was pre-pandemic.\\nYou need to give up your walkable idea and embrace the subway. Not only is it very convenient, it isn\\'t that expensive and my kids loved it.\\nWe also walked at least 10 miles/ day just because it all adds up. So, be prepared to walk even if you are \"walkable\" to things. You might not bother taking the subway a few blocks or just want to explore on foot. Based on the places you mentioned wanting to visit I would stay in midtown. Just make sure you are near a subway line so you can access other areas of the city easily. Most first timers like to stay in Midtown and your list of sights to see are mainly all in Midtown. Walking to all of them is a long way, example from ESB to Central Park, but it could be done if you like to walk a lot and are used to it. Don\\'t discount the subway and buses though, they are easy to use and cheap. You\\'ll get around faster and save your energy for when you get to each sight.\\nLook up Midtown if you\\'re looking at a hotel booking engine with a map feature. Midtown East has quieter hotels but still walkable to most of your sights.\\nTo make your days more efficient, make a list of every sight you want to see, plan your days so you are walking between them as least as possible, then post it back here so we can suggest more efficient uses of time.\\nAs a start, you could easily walk between TS and Rockefeller Center so include them on one day. Do try and include Top of the Rock if you haven\\'t already. Everyone will be wowed by that and the view of the city. Go there in the daytime, and go to the top of the ESB at night. We have been Greenwich Village denizens for 50+ years. Here, we like the Washington Square Hotel just across the street from Washington Square Park in the heart of The Village and stay there when family comes to visit NYC and we give them our Village apartment. The area is vibrant with universities and attractions, close to SoHo and Chinatown for shopping, has great outdoor dining and has easily accessible public transportation. Many touristy attractions are within a 1-2 mile stroll from the Hotel. Your 8-year old will love the park playgrounds across the street from the Hotel.\\nNote: The Washington Square Hotel does not always list all of it\\'s room availabilities on the Internet. We have found that directly contacting the Hotel yields best results. For more information, see:\\nhttps://washingtonsquarehotel.com/\\nCH\\nEdited: 4:34 pm, July 18, 2021 I would also recommend Midtown, I would even narrow it down to close to Bryant Park. Note that a lot of hotels have Times Square in their name without being in Times Square (which, in my opinion, is not a great place to say). I stayed close to Bryant Park and walked not only to Central Park but also to the 9/11 Memorial. Everybody I\\'ve talked to says we HAVE to do it, yet NOBODY remembers who they went through. Suggestions? Thanks! I love doing touristy things, but in all my years living here, I\\'ve never gone on one of those busses. Ask those who you\\'ve talked to, see which company they used. They\\'re likely all the same in reality, so look at reviews, etc. They are a great way to get an overview, but should not be used for transportation purposes. You certainly don\\'t HAVE to do it as a tourist; I\\'ve made 40+ trips without it. At this point none of the HOHO buses have live human guides on top. Not worth the time and energy. I\\'m pretty sure I did a Gray Lines tour on one of my first trips with my husband. I just found this site outlining the choices when I was looking to see which one we used:\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/new-york-bus-tours/#double\\nIf you haven\\'t been to the city before and it\\'s a nice day, it\\'s a fun way to look around and get the lay of the land. If you choose to get off, be aware that catching another bus with a good seat may not be easy. It has been many years since I did one, but I used Gray Line (they had live guides at the time, which I would prefer). If you are interested in a bus tour, I would stay on for a full loop to \"get the lay of the land\", then return to the sites of interest by subway. If you hop on and off too many times, you risk wasting time waiting for the next bus. Thanks! It does sound like a good way to get a Day 1 \"Lay of the land\" so to speak. I appreciate y\\'all I was told that I had to go on a bus tour with a friend one time when I went to see her in Ottawa. The day was camp & cold. My friend who had talked me into going on the bus tour with her complalned that she was cold & miserable the whole time. Without a live guide, I\\'m not sure at $45/person it\\'s necessary to do a “lay of the land” open top bus tour. I\\'d rather put the money toward a guided tour that will be a better use of time\\nSmallbustoursnyc.com\\nRealnewyorktours.com\\nare, imo, better options. We recommend the Hop-on-Hop-off busses, especially for 1st timers as way of getting oriented to the NYC. We walk a lot and take the subways and public busses to get around, but we still like the commercial “Hop-on Hop-off” double decker busses and (even though we have lived here in NYC for 50+ years) once or twice a year buy a pass and “do” the City as paying tourists. We started doing this years ago due to one of our friends becoming a tour guide/narrator for one of the “Hop-on Hop-off” operators following his retirement as a teacher (a linguist). He died some years back, and fondly remember him “singing” (great voice) to the tourists and us atop the open-air busses.\\nEven since then, we still enjoy the rides by the various HOHO operators; the biggest difference is not which operator you choose, rather it is the guide/narrator that you happen to get, and whether he/she is engaging or knowledgeable. There are times when we hop-off one bus and hop-on another (but same operator) so that we have a different guide/narrator. Some folks who post here think that one or another operator has more busses, but we have never been lacking for a pick-up.\\nThat said, we think that the rides are fun and a great venue in which to meet visitors from around the planet. A 1-day pass is quite sufficient and after that take the City busses and subways to see the sites and sights of your particular interest and spending more time at those places.\\nPS: if it is a sunny day wear a hat!\\nCH My husband and I are flying into JFK in September from Seattle, typically we\\'d get right on the train to go out to LI, but it\\'s such a long flight that we were thinking of staying overnight in the city and than picking up the rental car the next day and heading out. Our ultimate destination is Amagansett although we have family in Babylon and Smithtown. We fly in on a Wednesday and just have to be in Amagansett by Thursday night and it\\'s not a rush. Is there a place to stay close to JFK where there is a nice hotel and where we could grab a bite to eat? Long Island city? We could also go part of the way out to LI, but I don\\'t think there are any stations that we might get off at that are close to town. Depends on if you want to spend Thursday doing things in the city and then head out east later in the day.\\nIf yes, look into hotels in an area that interests you and comparison price the rental car pick up at a neighborhood location\\nIf you\\'ll be heading out earlier in the day the TWA Hotel is the only hotel on the airport proper and the Airtrain. It\\'s a historic building with some stylish amenities\\nThe other JFK adjacent hotels require shuttles https://www.jfkairport.com/at-airport/airport-hotels The TWA Hotel is a favorite We definitely are going to be leisurely about heading out Thursday. Long Island City is in the wrong direction from JFK to Amagansett.. I\\'m confused about your mentioning train and train stations and then renting a car.\\nI think a,lot depends on what time you actually arrive. If you plan on stopping to see family in Babylon and Smithtown anyway, you could stay nearer there. Otherwise the TWA hotel is a decent option. If you wanted to head towards Long Island but stay fairly close to JFK, I would look at Rockville Centre. You can easily take the train ( Long Island Rail Road) to RVC and there are a couple of hotels and many good restaurants near the train station--it is a very walkable village. From there, you can pick up your car rental and continue east on Thursday morning.\\nBeing that it will be September, you could also look at Long Beach. It is also an easy train ride and The Allegra is a hotel that is right on the board walk. There are also many good restaurants in Long Beach. I second - staying in Rockville Centre. It\\'s only 15 minutes from JFK. There are a few hotels in that area. Great culinary scene and nightlife. Then drive out east in the morning. It should take approximately 2 hours. Hello, Kinda a random question, but I had family that was planning to travel to NY next Friday. Do you think there is any chance that there might be a travel restriction back in place by that time? They live in the US. Anything to worry about or no?\\nThanks! No they won’t be able to travel? No travel restrictions likely but they should be prepared in case there are mask rules in place. They should be willing to comply with any local rules when traveling and not out up a fuss. What do you think?\\nYou have access to the same info we have, Yeah but you don’t expect by Friday for any travel restrictions to come into place? They’re both fully vaccinated if that makes a difference That wasn\\'t your question, actually your two questions:\\n\"Do you think there is any chance that there might be a travel restriction back in place by that time?\" No, I do not think that there might be a travel restriction back in place by that time.\\n\"Anything to worry about or no?\" No, I do not think there is anything for you to worry about.\\nEdited: 1:07 pm, July 17, 2021 I don\\'t think we will see domestic travel restrictions return, unless there is a variant that comes out which evades the vaccines. If that happens I think all bets are off. As cases rise across the country the more likely scenario is something like what France is doing by requiring vaccine passports in most public places. That won\\'t happen in the next few weeks, but if the delta variant causes a massive surge in NYC and a lot of people start dying I could see a move towards that, especially if it is shown to be an effective policy in France. Do you expect businesses or normal tourist places to be closed down at all? Or at worst just a mask order Will\\nCome back in place? Yeah that makes sense. Do you expect businesses or normal tourist places to be closed down at all? Or at worst just a mask order Will Come back in place? I’m talking like within the next 2 weeks of time. Nothing is changing in a week. Things don\\'t change that fast. If things get bad I doubt they will look to close things down they will likely instead look to vaccine passports. Only in the absolute worst case scenario would they look to go back to closing things down, although I suppose there could be additional capacity limits reimplemented. Hi , Traveling to NY with 8 yr old boys in Sep. They are crazy about skyline, empire state, Statue of Liberty, times square. So we want to stay somewhere around. What area would you suggest to look for hotels ? We plan to do the usual touristy things. Does early Sep sound like a good time weather wise? I would recommend staying on the Upper West Side. It\\'s really a lovely area with kids because it is residential as opposed to just touristy/ businessy. That means there are great neighborhood shops, restaurants and playgrounds. I know some think it\\'s silly to travel to NYC to do playgrounds but sampling lots of playgrounds was my 8yos 2nd favorite thing to do in NYC (after the Nintendo store). You are in easy walking distance of Central Park where there are endless boulders to climb and fabulous places to run around and play.\\nMy kids hate Times Square. I am so glad we didn\\'t stay there because they basically got there and were ready to leave.\\nHit Top of the Rock because the views OF the Empire State Building are fantastic! You can stay in either midtown or downtown to get to some of your destinations. At some point, you will need to use subway to get to the other attractions. There is no one place to stay here to see the popular attractions, things are spread out.\\nEarly September is typically very nice in terms of the weather, but no one can predict the weather. Early September sometimes brings the remains from hurricanes. Temperatures are typically very comfortable, day and night. With 8yos I would recommend not staying in Times Swuare. I wrote this recently in a thread about have you leaned on this forum.\\n>>>\\nThe best advice I ever got was \"do not stay in Times Square\". On our first family trip my kids were 9 & 11. We were in and out of Boston and on crowded Boston subway cars regularly.\\nWell we took the advice and did not stay in Times Square. Much to my surprise my 9yo freaked at the commotion of Times Square. If we had been staying there we would have had major drama every time we left or returned to the hotel.<<<\\nWe stayed at the Affinia Shelburne thst time in the Murray Hill n\\'hood. We could walk to Times Square. We were fairly close to Grand Central where several subway lines converge and could easily my ride from to the Times Square Station.\\nThe neighborhood has lots of residents and the kids got a little glimpse of \"real NYC life\". They saw dogs being walked, kids going to school and so on.\\nThu Upper West side already mentioned is also great for kids. It sounds like you want to be in the action so to speak.\\nWith 2 eight year old boys I would suggest staying near times square so you can walk to it , but not exactly right in it. I think a good compromise could be near Rockefeller center in midtown —-The jewel Hotel or the Radisson Fifth ave perhaps?\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d607712-Reviews-Radisson_Hotel_New_York_Midtown_Fifth_Avenue-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d1913413-Reviews-The_Jewel_a_Club_Quarters_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nEdited: 9:10 pm, July 16, 2021 Budget and bedding needs are usually the most important issues. With younger kids, a kitchenette is helpful. The issue of location is highly debated. I would perhaps stay nearish Times Square but not right there.\\nThe Hyatt House Chelsea has rooms with 2 queen beds, kitchen, included breakfast and is walkable to the Empire State Building but in the NoMad area, south of it, better for dining.\\nThe San Carlos also has suites with 2 queen beds (2 doubles are more typical), kitchenettes and a good central location...less expensive.\\nThese are just 2 ideas. Thank you all for the suggestions. Staying in Times square is not mandatory but we definitely want to stay in walking distance to atleast few of the things like Rockefeller, times sq, central park and empire state. I know they are still far from each other and we may not be able to walk all but I am targeting this neighborhood. Rockefeller sounds good. The San Carlos is an easy walk to Rock Center. Affinia Fifty, and Courtyard Midtown East are in that same area with rooms with 2 queen beds as well. Even though I am a Broadway Baby, I don\\'t stay in Times Square because the crowds are too much for me. Instead I head either east or west, depending on where I am staying to get out of the madding crowd before heading north or south to my hotel. Hi, We want to stay close to Times square, central park & Empire state building. I shortlisted a few hotels. Any recommendations amongst these:\\nM Social Hotel Times Square New York\\nSheraton New York Times Square Hotel\\nNew York Marriott Marquis\\nHotel Riu Plaza New York Times Square\\nThe Westin New York at Times Square\\nSofitel New York Central Park and the ESB aren’t that close to each other.\\nHave you skimmed the hundreds and thousands of reviews here about those hotels? Marriott Marquis is central right in the middle of midtown and is a common choice for families on their first visit. You can also walk to Central Park and the Empire State Building. For Central Park if you visit the Zoo, the petting Zoo is in a separate section, you may want to visit that first and bring Quarters as they only allow kids to feed the animals in the morning. Also eat at the Central Park Boat House, the food is better than by the zoo, and rent a row boat afterwards the kids will like that.\\nFor Empire State Building buy your tickets in advance online and show up a little before they open. You will be in the first lines going up and will save by not needing express passes.\\nAs others mentioned TOTR is also worth a visit.\\nFinally the trip down to Statue of Liberty can be long and boring for kids so I always recommend taking the speed boat tour https://www.thebeastnyc.com/\\nAlso closer to your visit visit the Timeout NY website they have a lot of adds but once you get to their events and best of list you will be able to scout out best playgrounds and kids events during your visit.\\nHappy Planning & (Most importantly) Have Fun!\\nEdited: 3:49 am, July 17, 2021 Here is the Time Out kids link, if you want to browse before your visit.\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/new-york-kids\\nEnjoy! The areas that you list as you want to stay in are all over Manhattan. I would acquire a guidebook with maps or at least a map & decide where you want to stay. Having stated that there is no one good place to stay. The main criteria should be proximity to a subway station with access to multiple lines. One comment is that many 1st timers think that Times Square is the hear of the city but it\\'s basically only close to the theater district and many think it is too crowded & noisy to be a good place to stay. If this was my list, I\\'d try to stay near the Empire State Building as it is a reasonably central location but not so frenetic that getting a good night\\'s sleep is an issue. that\\'s a great idea. I will look for hotels near empire state. I read on TA earlier that the Doubletree Hilton Metropolitan is currently closed for renovations, with an anticipated reopening date of 8/15. I\\'m scheduled to arrive on 8/18. If the hotel is not opened by the time I arrive, is there any specific hotel I could expect to be transferred to? Or would I be able to select another Hilton of my choice? I\\'ve never had this be an issue before, so just trying to be proactive in case I need to switch hotels before my trip. Actually I would immediately book a backup option that\\'s cancelable. You do not want to be at the mercy of the hotel to put you wherever THEY want. Frankly, even if they open in time, being there when things are just opening is likely to have some problems. There\\'s nothing so special about that hotel that would make me want to take the chance. You will likely not be given a choice. Also keep in mind that several nearby places on Lexington Av that they might use as alternatives are closed, either for good or temporarily. Both Marriott Eastside and Maxwell (formerly W) closed for good. Fitzpatrick, a couple blocks up street was closed, don\\'t know if has reopened (Fitzpatrick Grand Central IS open).Hotel Lexington, south of you, I think scheduled to reopen Aug 1. Waldorf Astoria closed for renovations. There is a Hilton Garden Inn on E 52 or 53 just east of 3d they might use since is in same family IF it had vacancies.\\nEdited: 2:08 pm, July 13, 2021 If you have status with Hilton they would have to \"walk\" you to a comparable or better property and likely compensate you with cash and/or points, I don\\'t know their rules. If you don\\'t have status with them, definitely have a Plan B I don\\'t think there are currently many Hilton brand hotels open in that neighborhood. In addition to the HGI there is a new boutique brand around 47th between Lex and 3d that I have been told is a Hilton brand, though I don\\'t know if it is open. I believe the UN Plaza in 44th at 1st is now a Hilton Millennium and I know it is open. The Waldorf was a Hilton, but is closed for renovations under new ownership and I have no idea what brand affiliation it will have when it reopens. That hotel on E 47 whose name I couldn\\'t remember is the Bernic (though the sign always looks to me like it says Bernie) and it is part of Hilton\\'s Tapestry collection. It\\'s a new build, open only a year or two. The HGI is also pretty new, though maybe a year or two older than the Bernic. \"I would immediately book a backup option that\\'s cancelable. You do not want to be at the mercy of the hotel to put you wherever THEY want.\"\\nThis, although a Hilton will put you in another Hilton hotel. But maybe not in a location you want. Not always, Jordan. Sometimes they put you in another property run by the same owners or management company I am in the process of changing my reservation with Expedia. I have checked the Hilton website, and the Hampton Inn Grand Central on E 43rd St looks to be available, and is fairly close to my original hotel. Does anyone have any suggestions if this hotel is not available as well? I would prefer to stay in the Midtown East area, but I\\'m open to other areas, as long as Expedia can edit the hotel reservation. Also, I\\'m not super picky about the hotel, just prefer a chain that I have used before (Hilton, Choice hotels, Best Western, etc). I have stayed previously at the Wagner, Loews Regency, Doubletree Hilton Metropolitan, and Comfort Inn Midtown West. Would prefer not to stay there again-hotel was fine, but wasnt a huge fan of the area. My wife and I are taking a 3 week driving trip to Northeast. Plan to spend 4 nights in NYC and need hotel with parking. Would prefer onsite. Most hotels offer parking as \"possible\". Driving will be hassle enough, so don\\'t want to fight for parking. Budget around $330/night. was hoping to stay in Lower East Side. Appreciate your help. You don’t have to fight for parking. I’ve driven into Manhattan quite a few times and parked.\\nI find the most hassle free way to do it is to find my own parking, I use spot hero.com\\nI use the website, I find a garage nearest to my chosen hotel and reserve.\\nThe website will show you the details of all the garages and prices ect. it’s a very easy website to use and understand.\\nIf I am on my own, I park my car and take a taxi to my hotel. If I have a partner I drop them off at the hotel with the luggage and then I go and park.\\nThe hotel I used one time that had their own parking ,I wouldn’t recommend at this time. Although I have never done it, some (most?) hotels that offer parking will find a nearby garage and valet your car there for a fee of course. I agree, we always find parking NEAR our hotel for 24-50% less than using the hotel valet, who likely is taking your car to the same garage. Most hotels don’t have onsite parking but use a nearby garage and charge you for the privilege Parking garages are everywhere. What you can do is to price one out that is close to your hotel to get an idea.\\nIcon is a good option take a look:\\nhttps://iconparkingsystems.com Very few hotels have their own garages because most people don\\'t come to NYC with cars. As others say, you’re better to find your own near whatever hotel you pick. I hope you\\'ll have all your belongings out of sight or better still, out of the car.\\nSince hotel prices fluctuate by date, it,s impossible to know which will fit your budget without dates. Remember taxes add 15% to nightly costs and some charge resort fees.

I understand allowed dimensions onboard, yet I have a large bag that needs to be checked in, can anyone help? If you can change your train, there is 1 train per day that offers Checked Baggage. This is the overnight train too, so leaving NYC at 2:40am.\\nI\\'m guessing here that trains run the same time each day, but as you\\'ve not shared any info on when you are travelling.\\nAmtrak website also clearly shows all the services available on the trains, so you should be able to find all this info yourself. Just in case you weren\\'t sure, you can take large luggage on ANY train on the Northeast Corridor, it just isn\\'t \"checked\", you carry it on (you can get help from a Redcap) and store it in the ample space at the end of the car.\\nYou might need help getting it off so ask a Conductor\\nEdited: 6:00 am, July 16, 2021 Thanks a lot, this was really helpful :) Thanks a lot, I tried visiting their website but couldn\\'t find an answer to my question, so I dropped them an email and waiting for their reply.\\nI will be going on Sep 28, preferably a morning ride. If you use Red Cap service, they will help you on the train. They can also call ahead to your destination for someone to help you off the train. Don\\'t expect a speedy reply from Amtrak!\\nRedCaps work for tips so be generous, especially if your bag is bulky or heavy!

The waits aren’t too bad. 1-800-872-7245. There are luggage size limits, but I\\'ve never seen anything enforced. That said, if your bag is really enormous you\\'re at risk, so think twice before pushing your luck. Using a Red Cap will help with the logistics and can give you an advocate if needed.\\nEdited: 5:43 pm, July 16, 2021 Hi, was thinking of booking a late September trip to NYC. Have been there many times, but I am concerned, I have heard there is an alarming rise in violent crime in the subways and there is diminished police on patrol in the subways and on the streets. My husband and I do a lot of subway traveling when we visit. Wondering if I should I hold off and wait to visit next year when things calm down. Looking for a locals point of view. This local’s opinion is that you should exercise the same degree of caution that you should have exercised last time and you will be fine. Yes there is more crime in big cities all across the country. And in small towns. And around the world. So keep your eyes open but come and enjoy, and ride the subways like everyone else I ride the subway every day and probably most weekends. I have not seen ANY violence since the COVID rules started loosening up and I have been out and about.\\nI was on the subway every day this week and both this past Sat and Sunday. I actually dozed off a bit on Saturday evening and work up before my stop and lived to tell the tale.\\nMy $.02, it\\'s no big deal. I am not a local but I just spent a solo weekend in NYC. I used the subway 9 times and it felt just like it did pre-Covid. Bad things can happen anywhere but I felt perfectly fine taking the subway. I did avoid taking it late at night (after 10 pm) just because I didn\\'t know if the ridership would be lower than normal. Pre-covid I would regularly take it at midnight or even 1 am. I certainly would disagree about there being less cops on patrol in the streets, that was not my experience at all.\\nYou should continue to be cautious and aware of your surroundings but go and enjoy. I wonder if you would please cite your source of information, as I haven’t read, nor heard, of excessive violence in NYC subways anywhere.\\nIf you typically drive everywhere at home, then taking the subway to a museum or to a restaurant would be a novel (fun) experience. Of course, walking and taxis are other good options, as well. Unfortunately Subway crime has gotten out of hand. It is not even worth it for whatever is left of the NYPD to even arrest criminals anymore as they do not face charges, are released immediately after arrest. My advice would be to avoid NY all together.\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/06/21/tourist-randomly-attacked-with-glass-bottle-aboard-nyc-subway/amp/ “ Unfortunately Subway crime has gotten out of hand. ”\\nHow big is the Titusville subway system? Has it always had a crime issue or is it a new thing? Agreeing with the other locals that the subway feels very safe to me; I’ve been riding it regularly for the past year - not as much as I did pre-pandemic, and not as late, because there’s been less reason to…but consistently 3-4 times a week. It’s been fine. (I’d also note that many of my trips are to out-of-the-way parts of Brooklyn and Queens. No problems whatsoever.)\\nIf you are someone who feels safer when police are around, no worries: there are lots of them.\\nMask usage remains very high on transit. Some people have remarked that they’ve seen some slippage, but I really haven’t. If anything, I think people are getting better at it (more practice, I suppose).\\nEdited to add - good one, Irish Fan!\\nEdited: 8:20 pm, July 14, 2021 Hi Linda - I’m at “your place” right now. And will walk to the subway and ride it back into Manhattan shortly!\\nThis whole fear mongering is absolutely ridiculous. OP was smart to ask for the opinions of locals who live and breathe the system here. We are all just fine. Statistically you\\'ll be fine, as most of use that use the subway have been, thankfully.\\nBut, let\\'s be honest, crime has been an issue in the city. There have been far too many unprovoked attacks in the subways and on the streets. So many here get on edge if we list issues with crime when people ask. You can\\'t hide the truth, it\\'s on the news all the time and it was one of the top issues in the mayoral primaries.\\nWe all know that the homeless situation has become worse and there are far too many out on the streets that have mental health issues and/or drug/alcohol dependencies.\\nThe reply in #6 is typical here, but is that really necessary. Does it help?\\nI say come and visit, decide for yourself, but as in any city, be aware of your surroundings.\\nEdited: 8:59 pm, July 14, 2021 Just fact checking reply 5\\nhttps://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/24/facebook-posts/claim-about-violence-democratic-cities-overreaches/ My 3 daughters and I will be spending the weekend in the City in a few weeks. We would like to stay in the Soho or Greenwich Village area. Two possible accommodations we are considering are the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Soho, and The Incentra Village House. Any information which might sway us to choosing one or the other would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. The Incentra is a very traditional hotel in the style of a guest house with kitchenettes. Some rooms are nicer than others and each are very different. Lovely location close to the Village and handy with the 1,2,3 trains nearby. There is no elevator there so if you have a high floor room you\\'ll have to walk up and down with your suitcases.\\nEven though it\\'s not a traditional hotel, more like a guest house, it\\'s still fine for vacation stays and has been operating for many, many years.\\nOn location alone, I prefer the Incentra.\\nTake a look at reviews for both hotels.\\nEdited: 6:08 pm, July 15, 2021 We have been Village denizens for 50+ years. We like the Washington Square Hotel just across the street from Washington Square Park in the heart of The Village and stay there when family comes to visit NYC and we give them our Village apartment. The area is vibrant with universities and attractions, close to SoHo and Chinatown for shopping, has great outdoor dining, and easily accessible public transportation. You and your daughters will love the area.\\nNote: The Washington Square Hotel does not always list all of it\\'s room availabilities on the Internet. We have found that directly contacting the Hotel yields best results. For more information, see:\\nhttps://washingtonsquarehotel.com/\\nCH @Aynat62. Thank you so much for your input! @CasaHoffa. Thank you! I called that hotel, but, unfortunately, they are totally booked the weekend we need. I stayed at Incentra twice some years ago – both times for one night. It was two 3-story buildings converted into a small hotel. Rooms were clean. They were small. I was solo both times -- if another person had been with me, we would have been constantly bumping elbows and shoulders. Incentra’s suites may be more spacious. The rooms I stayed in seemed over-furnished. They were decorated in a fussy traditional style; maybe a sleeker modern style would have made the rooms seem more spacious. One guy at the front desk was very pleasant. Another one less so. There’s no elevator, so you will be going up and down stairs. That’s a deal breaker for me now as I am walking with a cane. There are 3 subway stations within 3 or 4 blocks, but that distance sometimes is too much walking for me. Sohotel might be another option. Nthey have rooms with 3 beds (2 queens and a double I think) which might be more comfortable for 4 of you. The Courtyard Soho seems to have 2 double bed rooms. Unless you\\'re getting 2 rooms, I think that would be tight. Thank you for sharing your experience, Tantalus. @nywhiz - we stayed at Sohotel the last time we were in NYC. We loved it! Unfortunately, their 4 person rooms are all booked the weekend we will be there. What bedding would you get at Incentra? The Four Points Soho has rooms with 2 queens. It,s across from the Courtyard Soho. Wondering which you think is a better choice in December. The rooms at the Marquis feel more open with a wall of floor to ceiling windows. Most have great views (not so at the W). I assume you realize the big draw in December is not Times Square but Rockefeller Center although you can walk there from either of these hotels.. they\\'ve renovated the rooms (or some of the) at the Marquis. Do you know if the Marriott has fridges in their rooms? Yes, there\\'s a mini fridge\\nhttps://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nycmq-new-york-marriott-marquis/rooms/ Hello, I will be leaving from the old Penn Station at 3:20am in the morning on a Wednesday. Will it be very crowded at this time and is it easy to find your track, when it is displayed? Also, is there a Amtrak waiting area? Will Penn Station be safe at the Amtrak waiting area after midnight? I just hope it is not a ghost town at that time. It won\\'t be crowded at that time and signage is excellent. I was in the old Penn Station for an NJT train last weekend and there were signs urging Amtrak riders to use the new Moynihan facility across 8th Ave. I saw that the rolling Canadian check-in podium had disappeared and there was some construction going on. The ticket holder waiting area is still in operation and this is good given the number of homeless that sleep in the station. I suspect there are greater efforts to restrict the new hall to riders and that also has a restricted waiting area. I would head across the street for Amtrak. Apparently the Moynihan train hall is closed 1 to 5 am https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/for-moynihan-faqs.pdf\\nThe Amtrak ticketing / waiting area inside Penn is on the 8th Ave side of the station https://jasongibbs.com/pennstation/ Is there still a Red Cap service in the old Penn station area or has that one been moved to the new train hall? #4 from the first link in #3 (faq #8) I think it\\'s off hours only in Penn Since Moynihan only opened at the beginning of the this year I have no idea if the situation will evolve as the final touches are completed (will it ever be 24/7? but especially seating) https://www.curbed.com/2021/07/viral-tweet-inga-saffron-shame-moynihan-benches.html\\nSince the configuration of the tracks / platforms extends into Penn they\\'ll need a small Amtrak service presence if the overnight closure is a long term plan. Otherwise perhaps exit only via Penn?\\nAnybody have any idea about any redevelopment of the Amtrak area on the Penn side? There\\'s enough square footage I\\'d imagine more retail seems likely Back to the ticket holder waiting area question >> I see that Red noted it\\'s still in operation in the \"old Penn\" - but I wonder if anyone knows its hours of operation? I did a bit of searching - and found info on how it has been recently updated - but couldn\\'t find anything noting hours.\\nAnthony - since you seem concerned about safety in a nearly empty middle of the night station - I\\'d suggest a couple things: Considering you won\\'t have to buffer time for traffic / crowds at that hour - I\\'d suggest arriving \"just in time.\" If you want boost your confidence in trimming down your time margin - I\\'d suggest stopping by the station at some point before your trip - get a lay of the land - see where the Amtrak tracks are, how things operate etc. Maybe even find a station employee (or perhaps better - a police officer) and ask \"so what\\'s this pace like at 3:30 AM? Who\\'s around, what\\'s open...\" That\\'s what I\\'d do... In early June on a weekday, I took an early NJT train from Penn Station and almost all of the stores were closed even around 7 am except for a few food places. I could not even buy a newspaper. It seems likely everything in the station would be closed at 3:30 am. All of the stores in the LIRR station downstairs are gone for construction.\\nEdited: 10:51 am, July 16, 2021 Just wondering if it would be a bad idea to book that weekend especially given this is the 20th Anniversary. I don\\'t necessarily have that specific area on the agenda for this trip but I\\'m wondering if the entire city will be practically impossible to navigate due to increased crowds and safety issues?\\nI know nobody has a crystal ball but hoping for some thoughts from experts. I also might be traveling alone if the hubs is comfortable with that idea and currently he is not.\\nTIA NYC is always busy (historically). You\\'ll have no trouble getting around anywhere a few blocks from the Memorial Just plan to be in a different part of the city that day—anywhere above Chambers Street. There are road closures and minor disruptions. It has never been a thing that has affected the whole city. If this is going to be like the 10th anniversary, a very large number of New Yorkers will do everything they can to get out of the city that day. For the 10th the Public Theater presented a play by Richard Nelson about New Yorkers getting out, and trying to get out of the city for the 9/11 anniversary and complaining about what a pain 9/11 anniversaries were. Maybe they will revive it and you can go see it. It would be fine to book then but it is busy, but then again it generally always is. \"but I\\'m wondering if the entire city will be practically impossible to navigate due to increased crowds and safety issues?\" No. Even for the 20th anniversary I wouldn\\'t expect any issues like that except for people going down by the WTC itself. This is a very large city that routinely holds large scale events and continues to function as normal. You just need to avoid that particular area during scheduled events, but the rest of the city will be business as usual. ** I\\'m wondering if the entire city will be practically impossible to navigate due to increased crowds and safety issues?**\\nAbsolutely not.\\nIn many areas of the city, it will be as busy as it usually is. As stated, NYC hosts MANY large events. You can be a few blocks away from the event, and not realize that it is taking place.\\nAs someone who lives here, I will do nothing out of the that day...unless I plan to be in the WTC area. Be aware that on the anniversary day that the 9/11 Memorial (the plaza) is closed to the general public before 3 p.m., and the 9/11 Museum (below the plaza) for the entire day. Visits are reserved exclusively for survivors, family members of victims, and first responders (and a politician or two to give speeches) during those times. There will likely be activities on the plaza after 3 p.m. until midnight that will be open to everyone Thank you all so much! I\\'ve been to your beautiful city twice and I\\'m excited to return. I was shocked when getting prices for airfare and hotels that this was the least expensive long weekend that I found. I think the hardest thing outsiders dont realize, that NYC is so big. A major event can be happening and shutting down an area and only a few blocks away its like nothing is going on.\\nI think in general prices will be cheaper until international travel returns. If you are considering coming, now is the best time because of that One of the largest street fairs in NYC is the Atlantic Antic. It takes place a 2 minute walk from my home.\\nIf you are on my block that day, you may have no idea that it is taking place(if you are not from the area.) Walk on Smith Street or Court Street(1 & 2 blocks away) and you will notice more than the usual Sunday people strolling around. Hit Atlantic Ave and you will see a mob of people.\\nIf you are in the area, you will notice added security and crowds. The next neighborhood over, it may just seem like an ordinary Saturday for some. We are taking the train into NYC tomorrow. We arrive midday for one night. We plan to go from Penn Station right to Pier 36 to see Van Gogh, then need to travel to the Hilton at the UN to check in, then head to dinner and eventually to see Bruce on Broadway. So what do we do with our small carry on bags? We are checking with Pier 36 to see if they can be checked (easiest option) but failing that how do we not let dealing with luggage take up too much of our day? I\\'d hate to have to return to Penn Station to retrieve them before heading to our hotel. Can you go to Pier 36 via your hotel and drop the bags there? You won\\'t really be going out of your way if you return to Penn Station on the way from the pier to your hotel. You can check them (for a small fee) at Amtrak baggage claim. But check with Amtrak that this is operating post-pandemic. If not, Schwartz Luggage is nearby. Hop in a cab and go by your hotel and drop the luggage before heading to the pier I hate to say it, but your biggest problem is the location of your hotel. It\\'s nowhere near anything else you\\'re doing and kinda out of the way. Checking it at Penn station or the Van Gogh exhibit are the best options. Thanks for all of these helpful comments, and nywhiz, thank you especially, as I am going to see about moving to a better located hotel. You\\'d be better on the west side or at least closer to Fifth Ave, and a subway station. Have a look on google maps at how far out of the way you are. It\\'s a lovely hotel with great views, but not convenient for your plan.\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/3rutc2cm The UN hotel and Van Gogh are both way on the East Side. Do not schlep your luggage to Van Gogh. You will make a miserable experience even more miserable. I\\'ve rebooked us closer to Times Square and the theater. Thank you all again for these helpful suggestions! Have a great time! Sorry I missed this earlier. I would have said drop your bags off on the way to VG…\\nBut please report back on your thoughts!\\nZtaks, I know you hated this show so much. A friend of mine - who is an art collector, and sits on the Board of the American Friends of [probably the world\\'s greatest museum] - loved it…for the experience, not as a substitute for seeing the real art (as she travels the world w her Board work, looking at art). Reasonable minds will differ of course. I have tix for the other one…we’ll see. I hope OP enjoys it! But if not, there’s always Bruce to redeem the trip. Not sure best option for getting to the tennis tournament at night. Any recommendations on where to stay and advice how to get there and back late at night? Thanks the 7 train or LIRR goes back to Manhattan, there will be lots of people doing the same thing.\\nAlso citifield is there so there might be a baseball game as well Anyplace where it\\'s easy to connect to the 7 train https://new.mta.info/map/5256 This just inspired me to look for tix for Labor Day weekend when we are back in NYC and have lots of free time. Even the cheap seats are expensive! To understand how to get around New York City I use Citymapper app.\\nIn real time it will inform you of all your options.\\nIf you are new to using mass transit, its wonderful as it shows you step by step. If you’re like me when I was new to New York City, looking at the subway map didn’t help me one bit, but this app helped me get around like an expert.\\nUse it in conjunction when choosing a hotel.\\nEdited: 6:42 pm, July 15, 2021 Northern Traveler, a friend of mine who has a subscription took me with him on a tour of the stadium a few months ago, offered as a perk to subscribers. With distancing requirements, they were prioritizing subscribers and spreading people out. So there are less tickets available. So yeah, I imagine prices are insane. If you get \"grounds\" tickets meaning tickets for any venue except Arthur Ashe Stadium, there are cheaper ones avaialble. You cant see the premier matchups , but there are plenty of good ones to see The 7 train runs along 42 st. If you provide an idea of your budget and dates, we can offer some suggestions on hotels. A few that would work\\nThe Park Terrace, a nice newish boutique hotel\\nAndaz Fifth Ave\\nCourtyard Fifth Ave.\\nFairfield Inn fifth Ave Even the grounds tix were well over $100/person for the holiday weekend (Sat/Sun) If you are not interested in Manhattan, there are hotels in Flushing which is an easier traveling distance from the two major airports. This is one subway stop from the tennis stadium. Manhattan is about a 30 min. trip. Flushing has several new hotels, but be aware that the area has a very Asian feel and western-style food is not easy to find. Be careful of the boardwalk from the subway to the tennis as the surface is very uneven.\\nEdited: 7:12 am, July 16, 2021 A you here just for the Open?\\nIf you have other activities planned, and Manhattan or Flushing hotels don\\'t seem suitable, the Queens neighborhood of Long Island City has a cluster of hotels within walking distance of the Queensboro Plaza 7 train station and several other subway lines for easy access to other parts of the city. (See the subway map linked above.)\\nEdited: 7:29 am, July 16, 2021 The Riverside Park Conservancy has brought back a herd of goats for a second round of “Goatham,” where about two dozen of the hoofed helpers will devour the poison ivy in the hilly fenced-in area stretching alongside Riverside Drive from 119th to 125th Street.\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/hoof-over-riverside-park-2nd-annual-goatham-summer\\nEdited: 2:22 pm, July 15, 2021 We had a goat project like that near us at a golf course last year. Very friendly animals who would come over to the fence to be petted. Did a great job on the poison ivy and bittersweet and other weeds in the penned areas I am not certain I would want to pet anything that had been in poison ivy. We\\'re arriving at 2:55 PM on an international flight (Delta) at JFK. Could we possibly make an 8 PM flight (Delta) out of LGA? I\\'ve been waiting hours to speak to DL to see if they even book JFK-LGA connections so I thought I\\'d ask here about the time required. Thanks! Without traffic, it\\'s 17 minutes. BUT that\\'s a big caveat. There is a LOT of traffic on weekends, not as much in November as in the summer. Nevertheless, I think you have plenty of time to make that connection. If it is on one ticket bought from the airline then they will make sure you get to your destination. If flight 1 is on time (and schedules don\\'t change) , no worries.\\nIf schedules change or flight 1 is 3-5 hours late then I\\'d be worried taxi is 30-45 Mins It\\'s certainly possible but there are a lot of variables\\n-whether first plane arrives on time\\n-how long it takes to get thru immigration\\n-how long it takes to get luggage\\n- customs\\n-traffic between 2 airports\\nIt sounds like you didn\\'t buy the ticket from the airline.\\nEdited: 1:01 pm, July 14, 2021 Great, thanks, We\\'re currently booked BCN-JFK-ATL-GSO, arriving home at midnight. I\\'m going to try to change to BCN-JFK-LGA-GSO, arriving home 2 hours earlier. All because Delta cancelled their BCN-ATL flight that I booked. ( I did buy from Delta)\\nEdited: 1:04 pm, July 14, 2021 So what happens if you don\\'t make the connection? The trip from JFK to LGA is rather direct if you look at the map. There are major highways the whole way. There is reconstruction going on at LGA and what that might be like in Nov. is a question. When this first started, there were massive backups within the airport, but things appear more settled at present. At some point, they will have to shift the roadway as parts of the unified building are completed.\\nhttps://www.laguardiab.com/construction-updates\\nEdited: 3:03 pm, July 14, 2021 I finally got thru to Delta. They won\\'t do a JFK-LGA-GSO connection on 1 ticket so its JFK-ATL-GSO. Thanks to all who responded! First trip to NYC with my 19 & 23 year old kids in a couple weeks. Is Midtown East a good place to stay, especially considering Broadway is closed until September? Looking at the Benjamin Hotel and San Carlos Hotel (because we need a kitchenette) but I\\'m concerned the restaurants/shops in the area will be closed without the theaters? That area is far enough from the theater district that I doubt Broadway being closed is having a big impact (though the broader slowdown in tourism and emptying out of offices may). When I’ve been by the area semi-recently - just passing through - things seemed pretty open.\\nI do know that my favorite street food cart - the King of Falafel & Shwarma - is still going strong at the corner of 53rd & Park.\\nOne of our regular posters, Grandrue, lives in that area and will hopefully weigh in. Nearly 50% of storefronts throughout Manhattan are closed at this time. I expect this to slowly reduce over the next few years, but don\\'t be surprised to see tons of For Lease signs in the windows The area isn\\'t affected as much by closed theaters as by closed hotels and people not going in to work in the many nearby office buildings. The Benjamin was been open throughout the lockdown and housed medical workers at height of pandemic here in NYC. I think San Carlis reopened only recently. There are plenty of open restaurants, though some may be operating fewer hours than pre pandemic.\\nClosed businesses tend to be retail businesses - Ann Taylor, a sporting goods store, some smaller businesses, and though a few Starbucks and similar quick bite places have closed, others remain. It\\'s true, there are a lot of hotels in midtown east with kitchens or kitchenettes. In addition to the 2 you mention, Affinia Fifty is also there and may be a bit fresher having been more recently updated. While there are plenty of dining options, it\\'s not the trendiest area. If it weren’t for the need for the kitchen, I would suggest staying further downtown. The only hotel downtown with a kitchen I can think of is the Residence Inn Downtown which is in the financial district.\\nEdited: 12:35 pm, July 14, 2021 Note that if you do stay in east midtown you will find more dining choices as you head east toward Second and First avenues (and the cross streets between them) because this area is more residential and less affected by the pandemic. You will also find things like grocery and liquor stores in this area. As far as I know, none of the chain pharmacy-type stores like CVS and Duane Reade/Walgreens in this area (and there is practically one on every corner) have closed, though at the beginning some did cut back their hours and it became more difficult to find the 24 hour ones. I\\'m not sure what the current situation is as I haven\\'t recently needed to make s midnight visit to one. Also, a bit of history. One reason why there are several older hotels (like vintage 1920s) with kitchens in this area is that at the time they were built residential hotels were very popular -- that is, places where people lived long term, sometimes medium or short term. The type of apt living we are accustomed to today wasn\\'t as common then, and many singles or couples lived in residential hotels. They usually had restaurants,(and sometimes other facilities like pools and solariums), but some also had small kitchens or kitchenettes, and of course they all had housekeeping services. Many of the hotels on and near Lexington were built this way. Some have since become regular hotels and done away with the kitchens (not to mention the pools and solariums), while others have kept the kitchens. There were also some hotels like this on the Upper West Side and in west midtown. I believe there were a few, smaller, ones downtown, like in the Village area, and those that were down there have been either torn down or gutted and used for other purposes (like condos)\\nEdited: 4:15 pm, July 14, 2021 https://nypost.com/2021/07/13/train-fanatic-reveals-secrets-of-the-nyc-subway-system/\\nNice article.\\n-I remember living in Boro/Sunset Park and taking the B train into the city and seeing the \"Masstransiscope\" display!

It really was more than the sum of its parts and I\\'d do it again in a heartbeat. I think one of the nice things about it is that it\\'s a really interesting experience without being too intense/taking up too much time; we planned it around a breakfast trip and something else I can\\'t recall now.

I listen, question, do my own research, and come to my own conclusions.\\nWho’s been helpful? Wow! So many of you. Ziggy, nywhiz, frangipani, Linda spring to mind. Even those long gone from the forum like BrooklynMel and even grumpy bilmin helped. Fellow travelers like Aynat, maxisweden, WEQueen (semi-local?

Even as a local, I’ve been helped by many posters here. In terms of food recommendations - Very Fresh Noodles & Pure Thai Cookhouse have already been mentioned; thanks to Ziggy, I now know where to get the best egg tarts in Sunset Park Chinatown; I think it was jhwanderer who turned me on to Casa Enrique, which is now one of my very favorite places; Risa persuaded me to try the Fulton; nywhiz recommended a nice coffee shop close to where I used to go for Spanish class; other places escape me at the moment, but I know there’ve been many.\\nNycforever’s posts about Harlem have me wanting to spend more time uptown (the pandemic has been a barrier, but that will change); I learned about the Welling Court Mural Project from Ztaks; I’ve learned a lot about Astoria from Kaye and about Jackson Heights from jhwanderer; Howard convinced me to finally stay on the F past Jackson Heights & I spent a delightful morning in Forest Hills; ter’s Brooklyn stories & rec’s have taught me more about my own borough. And those are just a few of the local posters…\\nI’m pretty sure it was a visitor (maybe you, mcwhipppet?) who clued me in to the opening of the Poster House Museum. I’ve learned about many other destinations & special events through trip reports, and have been inspired to visit (or revisit) places after reading about them through visitors’ eyes.\\nEdited: 10:10 pm, July 07, 2021 I have been to NYC close to 20 times and always check out TA\\'s forum beforehand for the great advice and tips. Hoping to visit again in August. Fingers crossed our borders will open up in the next few weeks. Cannot wait!! mcwhippet I am also surprised that Risa\\'s thread has disappeared (I have asked to have it reinstated).\\nI have gotten so many great advice over the years on this forum, from restaurants to parks to bookstores or just nice streets to walk on.\\nI\\'ve had so much help to add to itineraries. I remember that when I visited Greenwich Village, someone suggested a walk on Commerce Street (I believe it was Risa) and now I added Cherry Lane Theater to the places I want to go to.\\nMy last trip was supposed to include Soho and as it was out of my usual path. I got great advice on restaurants and parks to visit. I believe it was Tom that suggested a dinner that I still have to go to.\\nI don\\'t think that without this forum I would\\'ve found so many beautiful and interesting bookstores, especially the Drama Bookstore that just reopened.\\nI do agree with you mcwhippet, \"I don’t know why people who knock it still choose to participate\". I enjoy coming to this forum almost every day to see what is being discussed, see if I can help anyone and see if there a place mentioned that I haven\\'t been to and now must.\\nAnd when I will once again be allowed to cross the border I will definitely be asking questions ! I am very grateful for all the help I\\'ve been given here. So many nice, wonderful people. And now that you\\'ve mentioned it...how DO you find the Brooklyn Bridge walking entrance? Is it hard to find? :) Lol, sunnyshine, it is s a little bit tricky finding the entrance on the Brooklyn side (which I think is the best direction to walk from, for those gorgeous skyline views). I think it’s mostly confusing because there are quite a few subway stops nearby that can spit you out of exits in different directions, which can be disorienting and it’s also a very busy area.\\nWe had gone for dinner nearby, so we took a route through Cadman Plaza Park to get there. I’m putting a link to a (probably overly-detailed) guide, but there are lots of others out there.\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/walking-the-brooklyn-bridge/\\np.s. I love the name sunnyshine! :) For the first time in nearly 30 years, the Texas A&M Transportation Institute has not named Los Angeles as the region with the worst traffic in the U.S. New York City/Newark is now king of gridlock:\\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/transportation/560909-new-york-tops-la-for-worst-traffic-in-nation-study Thank you Captain Obvious Not sure it’s that obvious…the NYC metro does have alternatives to private vehicles that metros like LA lack, so it’s depressing that things are getting worse here rather than better.\\nIf I sometimes get tetchy when visitors propose Ubering everywhere, this is why! Mass transit is often faster; always better for the environment; and has the potential to reduce congestion so that people who truly need to use private vehicles can get to where they need to go. ***Thank you Captain Obvious***\\nIt is obvious and this was mentioned in the news a few weeks ago.\\nCar, bicycle, mass transit - they\\'re all busy for a reason, we live in a very densely populated area.\\nIs mass transit always better for the environment? This is entirely the result of Covid.\\nLA traffic plummeted as many workers stayed home.\\nWhereas NY did not, as workers staying home were countered by workers driving to work for the first time, rather than taking public transit options that exist in NYC but not LA Damon W, I agree. There was a lot of misplaced fearmongering about transit as a vector of infection, and now we’re suffering the consequences in the form of increased congestion (and also carnage - more deaths in crashes than any year since 2013).\\nThe question is, what happens when more offices open up in September? Are people going to continue to drive into Manhattan? Linda, it will take a year for us to see how this shakes out, don\\'t you think?\\nI heard something super interesting (at least to me) over the weekend: a lot (or maybe just some?) of the financial institutions have made it known that they will continue to allow people who have moved out of NYC to work remotely, BUT, they will reduce salaries for those who have moved out by about 20%, since they are not in need of the extra money to compensate for increased housing and other expenses. And it seems workers are fine with it as the telecommuting option is very attractive. It will be interesting to see if other industries make that option available or whether that sticks, or people get tired of the sticks (pun intended. AND YES, IT\\'S A JOKE).\\nWe are living in a watershed moment. Many much needed reforms will take place, I hope most of them improve quality of life and the environment.\\nIn the meantime, I had a 6am Amtrak this morning. When I got to the subway about 5:35am, the signage said next train was in 17 minutes. I would have missed my Amtrak train, so I ran out and Uber came quickly, and I made my train with ten minutes to spare. Living on the edge.\\nEdited: 5:55 pm, July 13, 2021 Covid case counts are up in 43 states including NY. In some places the variants are spreading very fast and heading towards exponential growth. As people are being required to return to the office at the same time case counts are increasing it seems likely that at least some of those people will opt to drive vs using mass transit and as a result the traffic will continue to get worse. As long as crime is up, Mask Mandates on Trains (Why would I want to wear a mask on the train when I can avoid it in my car... People dont like masks, thats a fact) and Busses fear of getting covid on the train, People will avoid the train. As long as people are avoiding the train, they will drive.\\nNYC has choke points which makes it worse, Basically there are only 2 ways from Long Island (Including Brooklyn and Queens) to NJ (Verrazzano is a choke Point as it the GW Bridge) there will always be traffic Ive driven in LA and Sorry, LA has got nothing on NY. >>> When I got to the subway about 5:35am, the signage said next train was in 17 minutes. <<<\\nThat’s a huge problem (bigger, I think, than mask aversion or fear of crime)…as service deteriorates because of staffing shortfalls because of reduced revenues, people will seek alternatives, reducing revenues further & potentially creating a vicious circle…\\nWithout mass transit, this city would not be liveable. It’s a freaking archipelago, for Pete’s sake, with a limited number of tunnels and bridges (as Howard has already pointed out). Hello... I\\'m traveling to NYC with my husband and adult daughter from LAX to EWR for an upcoming trip at Thanksgiving 2021. Our son\\'s high school band made the Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Parade audition process and will be performing in the parade. They were supposed to perform in 2020, but yeah, you know... Covid caused Macy\\'s to defer the bands to 2021. Anyway, I have lots of questions. I\\'m doing my research but would love to hear from the experts. We will be arriving at EWR at 7pm on Sunday 11/21. Considering there\\'s no work traffic, should we just take a taxi from the airport to the hotel? We\\'re ok with spending a little more money for less hassle. Due to a layover and the time difference, this travel day will be a long one just to get from LA to NY! So, I think we\\'d all appreciate the less stressful option. I\\'m sure we\\'ll be starving when we arrive. Is there anywhere good close to the hotel for a great first meal in the Big Apple? Maybe pizza/Italian and nothing crazy expensive. I\\'m thinking $50 - $75 for the three of us. It won\\'t be a big night out. Just a decent meal nearby.... Thanks for your feedback! Arrange for a car service, super easy and less stressful.\\nIf you want a good Neapolitan pie, check out Don Antonio, it\\'s a quick walk from your hotel.\\nHave you considered non-stop flights? I fly to LAX from Newark and they have non-stop service. @springerandy - Yes, where possible we always try for non-stop, but we are using miles for this trip, so we had to suck it up and take the layover flight. Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it! Carmel car service is pretty reliable and cheaper than a taxi. It’s hard to predict what will be open in November. You probably won’t arrive until close to 9 pm and a lot of places will be closed by then. You might want to just bring a pizza back to the room . There is also Trattoria Trecolori on W47th Street which is just down the street from the Edison Hotel. They close at 10:30 pm. There is also John\\'s Pizza on 44th Street. There is a Friedman’s restaurant in the hotel Edison.\\nNyc has gotten more dangerous this year between e bikes and the mentally ill. You need to be alert and avoid wandering around in the dark in that area.\\nJust go to Friedman’s at the hotel, it might average $30 or so pp. Trecolari is also a good idea depending on what time you get in. FYI, lots of decent and reasonably priced Thai places nearby. Thank you everyone! I will look into hiring a private car for our ride to the Edison Hotel.\\nAlso, I should’ve thought to look at what our hotel offers for food. I thought it was breakfast only. We didn’t pick the hotel, it was part of a package put together for families of the band members. That restaurant is perfect and very easy.\\nI’m concerned about the comment re: safety. Is it not advisable to walk around that area at night? You’ll get a whole range of opinions on the issue of safety. Hopefully theatre will be up and running by Thanksgiving, more people make that area a bit safer between 7-1030pm. Honestly, I’m a seasoned New Yorker and I wouldn’t walk around that area after 9 pm; it’s kind of sketchy. Crime is way up here. And we have a plague of crazy cyclists, e bikes, etc, you have to be very careful crossing the street. I’m sure you’ll have a great time but\\nyou can’t just walk around with your guard down like a wide eyed tourist. Friedmans is a good option, but so is Trattoria Trecolori (less than half a block away).\\nI personally would not hesitate to go there at night. You can also just grab an uber or lyft at the terminal. Should bring you very convenient to Manhattan and the hotel.\\nA good alternative would also be the Newark Airport Shuttle from EWR Airport to Port Authority. The Hotel is 5 mins walk. But with a group it\\'s more likely that a car service like carmel and Dial7 or lyft/uber are cheaper I will be visiting new york in the day time and parts of night time. I will walk from the amtrak train station to au chevil. Will that be a safe walk for me? I will be traveling alone. Have anyone had the burgers from au chevil? Do anyone know if they accept cash at this restaurant? Is time Square safe at night? I don\\'t know au Chevil, so I looked it up and I am guessing you mean Au Cheval which is about an hour walk from Penn Station. What time are your arriving?\\nI have never been so cannot tell you about the burgers, but I am guessing, as most restaurants, they accept cash.\\nAs for Times Square, I travel to New York City alone as a woman, have been there at 2am and never felt unsafe. Do you mean Au Cheval? It,s an hour\\'s walk from where the train stops. You could take the subway and get there in 15-20 mins. Yes it’s safe. I will walk around 3 pm to the buger place. I will only go for one day. Arrive by train at 2 30 and leave 3 20 am the next day. Hotels are too expensive for me. This place (which I\\'d never heard of) apparently originates in Chicago. It looks like you,re going there. Why not have a burger there in Chicago? Reviews here have not been good\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/2019/6/18/18681291/au-cheval-nyc-chicago-sodikoff-restaurant-review\\nHere\\'s a list of burger places here\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/maps/27-best-burgers-nyc\\nOr do you work for this restaurant? I thought you were visiting the original place in Chicago?\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g35805-i32-k13521869-Best_burger_in_the_world_at_au_cheval-Chicago_Illinois.html I would take a train, but I heard it is very difficult and easy to get lost. Those burgers aren\\'t by any chance made out of \"cheval\" (horse meat)? If you have the time and enjoy walking, I would personally walk. It is an hour, but at least you\\'ll get to see the city during your walk. You\\'ll be walking through Chelsea, Greenwich Village and Soho, not a bad way to spend your short time in New York City. Subway isn’t difficult. Use the MTA website or app. Agree with both #8 and #9…you will be fine walking, and will see a bit of the city that way; but also, it’s super easy to get there by subway. Just walk to Herald Square and take the N, Q or R in the Downtown/Brooklyn direction. My girlfriend and I are going to see Billy Joel at MSG on December 20th. We\\'re thinking of getting a hotel room within walking distance from the Garden. We probably won\\'t be in the hotel much. Just a place to sleep after the concert instead of taking the train home. Any recommendations? I\\'m leaning towards The Kimpton : Hotel Eventi. at $211.00 which includes taxes and fees. Not a great fan of the area, but that would be my first pick in the area. I generally like the level of service at the Kimpton properties and the Eventi looks nice. We have stayed there and it\\'s a nice hotel I also don\\'t care for the area but for your purposes, the Eventi is one of the best options, especially at that low rate. I have the sense that the rooms are starting to show wear and tear from some of the reviews. But for one night, it should be fine. If you\\'re also happy with something a little modern and funky, the Moxy Chelsea is walking distance. Not sure if their rates would suit you but take a look.\\nThey also have a very flowery and pretty rooftop lounge called the Fleur Room, might be good for a nightcap after the show.\\nEdited: 5:54 pm, July 13, 2021 I visited a friend staying at the Eventi in 2019. It was perfectly fine then (and she\\'s very picky). The restaurant in the hotel was good before the pandemic. Haven\\'t been pack since. It\\'s probably where I would stay in your circumstances. Hi, getting married in NYC in June 2023, after the ceremony we planned to go to Central Park and get pictures there and then go to mr purple rooftop bar for meal and drinks. Just wondering if there’s somewhere we can go after there where we could potentially have our first dance? Preferably a rooftop bar! You\\'re asking what will be open in two years time?\\nI\\'d check back in the fall of 2022 to get an answer that is more likely to have a semblance of accuracy. Right now so much is in flux that other than Central Park, I wouldn\\'t bet on anything being there 23 months out Alas, because of the pandemic;\\' the food service industry is in a large state of flux. You don\\'t need to make reservations until about a month out so, as frustrating as it is for those of us who like to plan in advance, you need to be patient. No I’m looking for example of places where people would go for live music and a dance floor. I know I can’t book anything two years in advance I was just wanting to ask for places that people would go for music and a dance, probably pre covid times just so I could have a nosy.\\nYeah I like having a plan in place but I understand can’t book anything just yet I understand your intentions, but something one of us might suggest now has a much greater than zero chance of disappearing or changing radically between now and your event. Covid issues aside, you need to think about the possible expense and advance payments required for many such places. If your ceremony is on a Friday or Saturday, it will be particularly hard to book a large group, with or without a private room. Dinners often require an advance menu selection, so you\\'ll need your special dietary requests in advance. You may also find that prices in Manhattan are much higher (by a factor of 2 to 10) than you might have expected. You cannot save money by just showing up with a group of 20, either. Nightclubbing is just not like that in NYC.\\nRooftop bars are a special category, that are hard for a simple couple to get into at all. But there are many definitions of \"rooftop\", and some views are only in one direction, down an avenue, or even just a side street, if you go to the edge and look over! You may benefit from the search box next to your OP, pretending that you are just looking for a special night for a couple. Just to survey the situation as it was, pre-Covid. Try Mr French, they have capacity for small and large events, in addition to their availability as a restaurant/club. I think they are in the process or just recently moved. I think this may work for you. https://www.misterfrenchnyc.com/homepage/ My husband and I are set to to fly out to NYC next week (July 14-18). I know Elsa has hit hard. Should I cancel our trip. Will the severe weather pass by then? The storm passed through here quickly, no need to worry. So the street and subway flooding aren\\'t an issue? Thanks, OP, for asking.. I had the same question. Street and subway flooding pass quickly. We\\'ve had some torrential downpours the last couple of days making for dramatic Twitter posts, but they don\\'t generally last more than 30 or 40 minutes and as soon as they let up the drainage system catches up. Unless we get more rain when you\\'re here (thunderstorms are common in summer) things should be fine. Seems like lately we have had a lot of hot days and then thunder storms. Feels like more thunder storms than usual. That being said the city doesn\\'t stop due to thunder storms. The media makes a big thing out of it with their little videos but life is back to normal by the next day without missing much of a beat. Elsa is long gone. There will be more rain and high heat between now and your visit. NYC doesn\\'t sustain street flooding for a week. Those pics/videos are a thing of the past. The subway was back to normal a few hours later. To add, this wknd will be.a normal summer wknd in NYC. Those pictures were only a small section of the city, most of the city is just fine Here\\'s a NY Times article about the rain and the subway:\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/nyregion/nyc-subway-flooding-climate-change.html?campaign_id=44&emc=edit_ur_20210710&instance_id=35029&nl=new-york-today®i_id=51574278&segment_id=63143&te=1&user_id=711df6e1327df9d73b5926566797a644 Awesome! I figured it was exaggerated but also wanted confirmation. Thank you all! NYC has more temporarily closed hotel rooms than any other U.S. city, but also has far more new rooms opening in the remainder of this year than any other U.S. city. As of July 1, 21,878 rooms were under construction in NYC with 8,570 rooms set to open by the end of the year. What will this mean for occupancy rates? Prices of rooms? Is it bye-bye for older hotels? Planning for these new hotels did start back in tourist-boom days, but the numbers are still astonishing in this pandemic era:\\nhttps://www.hotelnewsresource.com/article116452.html\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/06/11/checking-in-8-extraordinary-new-hotels-opening-in-nyc-this-year/\\nhttps://newyorkyimby.com/2021/07/pendry-manhattan-west-prepares-for-september-debut-at-four-manhattan-west-in-midtown-manhattan.html I\\'mplanning a trip in September and think I will hold out on a hotel decision for a while!! If you do book one of the new hotels, you might very well get a bargain introductory rate in a room with spiffy new furnishings. But new hotels are notorious for not meeting their scheduled opening dates, so be sure to have a backup reservation at a hotel that is operating -- just in case yes, thank you. I will book something I can cancel and keep looking!! I’m looking for recommendations for a good hotel on or near Time Square so I can have everything close by. Preferably clean, safe, modern.\\nRecommendations for good Broadway shows/stand-up comedy shows recommendations during December.\\nWhat activities and places to visit in NYC.\\nPlaces to eat.\\nAlso, would really appreciate any tips and advice for first timers visiting.\\nThanks in advance! In order to give you a good hotel recommendation, we need your exact dates of travel (hotel rates vary daily), budget in US $ including 15% taxes & desired bedding configuration.\\nThere are far too many shows to give any kind of recommendation but check the web site Show-Scare for ratings based on pro & non-pro reviews & then read the reviews in order to get an idea of what might be to your taste.\\niAs for what to see & do there are to many things to see & do & people vary so wildly that giving you a one size fits all itinerary is impossible. Get ahold of a guidebook & see what you want to see. To the right are answers or at least partial answers to many of these questions. Are you saying you want to stay in Times Square because you want to actually stay in Times Square or are you just saying that because you believe it is the only central location? There are other areas you can stay that are also centrally located without dealing with all the crowds etc of times square. A good first step is reviewing the answers to the right, figuring out what attractions you want to see, then looking at a map and seeing where most of them are located. From there you will see what neighborhoods you will be spending most of your time in and you can look at hotels from there. As long as you have subway access you can get around pretty easily. In December there are usually a lot of Christmas activities especially concentrated in midtown (again see the question to the right about Chirstmas). We don\\'t know what this Christmas will look like but hopefully it will be much closer to the pre-pandemic experience . Nick,\\nIt sounds like you want someone to plan your whole vacation, which we don\\'t do here. There are loads of trip reports, there is a wealth of info on tripadvisor itself on what to do in NYC.\\nIf you want someone to plan everything, then there are people that do that, and a travel agent will also help booking hotels without caring too much of where it is or if it is really suitable.\\nHelp us to help you, and tell us what exactly you want.\\nThe vast majority of hotels in NYC are clean and safe. I personally wouldn\\'t think there are many \"modern\" ones around Times Square (Times, as in the newspaper, not Time, as in the Time), but there is more to NYC than just Times Square.\\nVisit it by all means, I have many times, but it is just so crowded in comparison to areas such as Upper East Side (great if you want to do museum), or Union Square, SoHo, Chelsea, TriBeCa, (great areas for restaurants and bars).\\nNot everything is close, so plan using public transport and you\\'ll be able to get around easily.\\nM From the right column titled “Top questions about NYC”\\nTips for first timers including info on hotel selection and location\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k8949287-Tips_Hints_and_Suggestions_for_First_Timers_to_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nMust sees and dos\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-s409/New-York-City:New-York:First.Time.Visitors.html\\nXmas stuff\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13419686-Christmastime_in_NYC_2020_What_s_On_Dates_Updates-New_York_City_New_York.html I wouldn\\'t stay in Times Square. It\\'s one of my least favorite areas of NYC. Crowded, mediocre restaurants, pushy money grabs (costumed characters...). I like to see it...then leave. I would look for a more residential neighborhood for a great NYC stay.\\nI love the NBC Studio tour and Top of the Rock. Book both in advance. My favorite time to do TOTR is arriving about 60-90 minutes before sunset to see the lights of the city come on. You get great views and pics of the city in day plus night. I also would not stay in Times Square but a lot of hotels have Times Square in their name without being actually in Times Square. You might look for a hotel close to Bryant Park or Columbus Circle.\\nFor Broadway shows, it all depends on how much you are willing to spend and what type of shows you like, I personally am not a fan of musicals and there will be a lot of those in December as most plays do not seem to be coming back before March 2022. For a comedy show, I would suggest Comedy Cellar.\\nAs others have said it\\'s hard to answer places to visit as there are so many, my usual go to are Central Park, Grand Central Station, Washington Square Park and the New York Public Library amongst so many other places. Another thing to think about when deciding which places you want to visit in New York is if you plan on going more than once. If you live far away (your profile doesn\\'t say) and this is a once in a lifetime trip, then hit the big spots. The ones I mentioned and also Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, 9/11 Memorial, Times Square and Brooklyn Bridge (amongst, again, other places).\\nFor restaurants there are thousands, so it will depend on may things: how much you are willing to pay (alcohol is expensive), what time of food you like and where you will be in the city. You can go really cheap to really expensive.\\nIf you can come back with questions a little more specific, I am sure you can get a lot more suggestions. To get good answers you need to share some info. What do you like and dislike? Are you travelling alone or with others?\\nDoesn\\'t make sense to recommend the best restaurant to get a pastrami sandwich to a vegetarian or the Children\\'s Museum of Manhattan to somebody travelling without children.\\nEdited: 11:39 am, July 13, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum posting guidelines with prohibiting self-promotional advertising or solicitation.\\nWe ask all of our members to keep their forum messages free of self-promoting advertisements or solicitation of any kind - members affiliated with any tourism-related business should not include commercial contact information or URLs in their forum messages.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 2:43 pm, July 28, 2021 From 7/19 to 8/22 there will be an extended restaurant week. Not every restaurant will have a good deal, but sometimes there are diamonds in the rough and you are able to try out higher end meals for reasonable prices.\\nhttps://www.nycgo.com/restaurant-week/ Is this thing now subsidized by parking garages and MasterCard? I tried to check out what was on offer at about 6 restaurants. Only one had posted its special menus. All the rest gave only prices, a reminder you get $10 back and entered in some sort of lottery if you dine onsite and pay with mastercard, plus ads (and an option to book) dozens of garages, many of which were a VERY long walk from the restaurants they were supposed to be convenient for. Does everyone dining out in Manhattan now drive? I know a lot of people now drive for groceries, to go clubbing, etc., But I didn\\'t realize they were driving to the local Japanese restaurant.

Firstly, You can pay most places by card, so cash isn\\'t that much of a worry.\\nSecondly, your UK Bank Card should let you withdraw cash anywhere in the world in the local currency, but there may be fees involved, but there is no need to withdraw GB to then convert.\\nM This is not a serious question\\nIt\\'s an \"experiment\"\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186338-i17-k13606270-o30-How_to_withdraw_USD_cash_in_London_UK-London_England.html Why would I need to draw $US?\\nWhen I get my taxi to Time Square I will pay my cab fare with crisp UK sterling notes\\nI am sure that the cab driver will accept them\\nSame when I buy a newspaper on the corner of Broadway, a £1 should suffice\\nI will report the results of \"my experiment\" in future postings Lol Ashtonian.\\nAs a teen I remember hearing \"European hotel staff loves being topped in US dollars\". Ugh! Talk about obnoxious American Tourists!!! Hi Folks\\nWe are going to be staying in NYC (Times Square area) for a week and then taking a road trip to Niagara falls. I can use some of the communities help in some planning.\\nWe are going to be travelling with kids: 9, 7 and 4yr old\\n1) What do you guys recommend for a car rental location? Should we take a taxi out of Manhattan and pick up a car somewhere or is there someplace around Times Square that would work?\\n2) Now for the actual road trip. Its about a 6-7hr road trip. Are there any places along the way to stop and check out? Perhaps a place where we can even spend the night instead of doing a non stop trip. Any recommendations would be much appreciated!\\nThanks! The Canadian government has closed the US/Canada border for non-essential travel until at least 7/21. They may extend the ban as they\\'ve already done so.\\nIf you can make the trip, I suggest you check out the Finger Lakes region for an overnight stay. I would plan for eight hours one way, and make sure you are satisfied with US side of the border attractions.\\nLook into flights to Buffalo as an alternative, you might find some good prices. There are numerous neighborhood car rental locations in Manhattan\\nFor a group your size/type I doubt that if the expense and hassle of going to a suburban location is worthwhile I agree with Kaye # 3. I have picked up Rental cars in Manhattan. I dropped off even more. I find it easy to find and use a Rental car agency near my hotel. I mostly use Hertz. but there are many other companies.\\nhttps://www.hertz.com/rentacar/location/unitedstates/newyork/newyorkcity/nycc18/\\nWhen I am alone I take a taxi to the rental agency with my bags and I am on my way. When I have a partner, I go to the rental agency on my own, go back to the hotel and we load up the car there.\\nTo minimize actual driving in Manhattan itself, I suggest picking an agency near where you’re exiting Manhattan.\\nI have dropped off cars in the upper West side and a few on upper Eastside.\\nI purposely chose hotels in these areas, because I find driving less chaotic there.\\nI agree with Northern, I think it will be close to eight hours from Time Square to Niagara Falls, New York. You have to account for fuel stops and bathroom breaks.\\nIf you decide to break this trip up with an overnight , I agree with Blume, Finger Lakes, New York would be a good spot, it’s about five hours from NYC. Then about two hours and 45 minutes from there to Niagara Falls, New York.\\nEdited: 5:38 pm, July 10, 2021 A further explatuion on my 1st post. You do not have to go into Canada to see the Falls but many, if not most, of the pictures you see commercially are taken from the Canadian side as the American Falls face Canada. Also, please note, in order to enter into Canada, you need to have proper ID. I state that because you don\\'t state your home base & some US citizens don\\'t realize that Canada is a separate county (also be aware of this if you use a mobile phone as the charges could be international charges.) -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff has removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guidelines with regards to off-topic chat.

When we got to the hotel, my cousins were upset because we hadn\\'t called regularly to give them progress teports while we drove through Canada from Syracuse to north of Detroit. When we were doing some sightseeing on Belle Isle in the middle of the Detroit River, my cousin expressed concern that she wanted to take a call but her phone warned her that it would be at international rates. I told her that the nearest cell tower was in Canada.\\nNever assume. never presume. Thank you all for the tips. I appreciate it. We are US Citizens; so if the Canda border is open; we will look into going there. Otherwise; we will have to see the falls from the US side.\\nAs far as rental car; will look at locations in Manhattan itself. Has anyone by chance stayed in a Queen Deluxe at the Marlton Hotel NYC? We will be there dropping our kid off at school and he will be with us for two nights, we will be there for 7. They suggested that room because you can add a roll-away bed. I\\'ve looked at the photographs on the website/TA but would like to hear firsthand what I should expect in terms of space ( I know it won\\'t be much but am I to expect super cramped or...) I\\'ll definitely take specific pics when I\\'m there and post. Any info is appreciated. Do you know that you can ask this specific Question on the Marlton hotel page on TripAdvisor?\\nEveryone who has left a review of the hotel will be notified of your question.\\nbooking.com often gives square footage of rooms.\\nthe deluxe queen room at the Marlton is 175 ft.² according to booking.com Thanks! I didn\\'t know that! We will be staying at the Residence Inn Central Park from 7/26-7/29. What are some good restaurants within walking distance? We like all kinds of food, nothing fancy but nice atmosphere, entrees under $40. Chef-owned would be great; like a varied menu.\\nWhat do you consider the most accurate websites for reviews of NYC restaurants? I have looked at Ziggy’s in the past: still current info?\\nWhat are considered to be the best Asian restaurants in this area or anywhere in the city? Thank you in advance for your help. Bear in mind that I haven\\'t been since before the pandemic so I\\'m not sure if these are stil any good or if they\\'re still open. But I\\'ve enjoyed them! Within a 15 min walk or less.\\nTacuba - Mexican\\nIl Melograno - Italian\\nTaboon - Mediterreanen / Middle Eastern\\nI know Ziggy in the past has recommended Pure Thai Cookhouse, but I have never been myself. I\\'m assuming that your first question \"within walking distance\" means you\\'re looking for 5-10 blocks (\"walking distance\" can mean a lot of things to people, I often walk an hour for dinner because I like walking). The following restaurants fit that description (keep in midtown that in this area, restaurants tend to be VERY expensive):\\n1. Nobu on 57th St. Undoubtedly one of my favorites for sushi/Japanese food. The lettuce wraps are probably my favorite dish on the menu, although the fluke sashimi dish is a close second.\\n2. Avra for Greek food. Molyvos and Milos are also close by, but the atmosphere at Molyvos is a little to sterile for me, and Milos is generally out of my price range, although they have a very affordable lunch special (I last ate the lunch special shortly before the lockdown - truly a good deal).\\n3. Quality Italian. What\\'s in a name? Or, if the shoe fits....\\n4. Jams. Chef owned by Jonathan Waxman, James Beard award winner et al.\\n5. Amaranth. Bistro style, very Euro\\n6. Jojo. A Jean-Georges restaurant.\\n\"What do YOU consider the most accurate websites for reviews of NYC restaurants?\" (emphasis added). What do \\'I\\' consider - as opposed to what is objectively the most accurate? I rely on reviews on Eater.com, the NY Times, and Grubhub (I also like the style of writing from those reviewers - if I don\\'t enjoy reading a review, it doesn\\'t matter how accurate they are.) Those most reflect how I like to eat and rarely fail me. I look at The Infatuation more for entertainment - it\\'s good for learning what\\'s new and hip.\\n\"Best\"Asian restaurants is subjective. As I don\\'t eat meat, places like Korean bbq don\\'t appeal to me, others may may have good suggestions for that. In the relatively recent past, I really liked Wayan, a French-Indonesian restaurant (way out of the neighborhood), Sona for Indian, and Silver Apricot for creative Chinese inspired fare. I actually was skeptical whether I would like Silver Apricot, but a friend visiting from out of town (former NY\\'er with great taste) had read the NYTimes review and insisted on going there. She was right. It was fantastic. If you go there, that will be your sleeper discovery. *too sterile. Oops, too late to edit. Rue 57 is close by and less expensive than most of the places I listed. I just don\\'t think it\\'s as good as any of the others I mentioned, which is why I didn\\'t include it. Becco is one of our favorites for Italian on W46 btwn 8/9th, owned by restaurateurs Lidia Bastianich and her son Joe. For a fixed price of $29.95 per person they offer 3 fresh pastas and sauces, all you can eat, tableside from the kitchen, hot out of the pan along with a Cesar salad or antipasto to start and of course plenty of bread; you can also order appetizers and entrees from the regulars menu, most under $40.\\n🐤 https://becco-nyc.com/\\nThey do a great job updating their menu daily with their fresh pastas and sauces of the day!\\nEdited: 2:42 pm, July 11, 2021 Thank you, Risa, for all of your help! I appreciate your time and efforts. I will definitely consider this restaurant. Thank you! Although the blog hasn\\'t been updated since 2020, you might like to browse through the Hell\\'s Kitchen Survival Guide which has some great restaurants reviews, of all cuisines, some which have already been mentioned.\\nhttps://eatingwithziggy.com/2013/06/27/the-hells-kitchen-survival-guide/\\nThat hotel is in a great location for walking to eating places on 9th Ave. Just head to 9th Ave and make a left. You\\'ll come across many good eating places.\\nIf you want a little splurge, Marea up on 59th St, a 5-10 min walk from the hotel. Becco was terrible when we went. One of the only disappointments on all of NYC. I would give that one a pass. Going from Times Square to cape liberty on a Sunday is traffic still busy thanks I believe there is a major project on the Bay Bridge which might result in it being closed on weekends. Even though your on the same side of the bay it could back up greatly on to the local streets.\\nEdited: 4:13 am, July 12, 2021 Traffic is always busy in the Times Square area to get to one of the tunnels. But check traffic reports and see which is more backed up, the Lincoln or the Holland Tunnel. The Lincoln Tunnel entrance is very close to Times Square and in most cases, would be the better choice (it\\'s what I would do from Times Square). However, it is a little trickier to get to the Turnpike from the Tunnel to get to Bayonne (even though it\\'s all a very short ride - maybe 5 minutes on the turnpike) - are you driving yourself or taking a car service/cab? If being driven, no worries, they will know how to get there. The Holland Tunnel will take longer on the Manhattan side to get to from Times Square, so it may not be worth it, even though on the Jersey side, it\\'s super close to Bayonne - you get on at 14C and get off at 14A.\\nI\\'m not sure what the previous poster is talking about - Bay Bridge? Do you mean Bayonne Bridge? It has absolutely nothing to do with getting to the Port area from Manhattan. There is a new road from the Turnpike that will put you at the Port, that doesn\\'t require you to drive the local streets of Bayonne (which wouldn\\'t matter anyhow, there is no impact from traffic on the Bayonne Bridge on the local streets of Bayonne, except, perhaps, in the immediate area of the Bridge). The Bayonne Bridge is at the complete other side of town and has nothing to do with the traffic from Manhattan to the Port. If you\\'re referring to the Turnpike Bridge (as locals call it), the traffic won\\'t affect the short ride on the turnpike to Bayonne. It\\'s only a few miles. And a car service driver would then take the back roads which also aren\\'t very far. The only Bay Bridge I know is in San Francisco, and it connects San Francisco and Oakland. I think someone got their cities and/or bridges mixed up.\\nEdited: 1:43 pm, July 12, 2021 I meant the Bay Extension bridge which is what the locals I know refer to it as since the Turnpike Bridge is off Exit 6 and connects the 2 Turnpikes of NJ and Pennsylvania. Depending on the time and what construction they are doing I.E closing the Skyway for the weekend or the construction project on the Bay Ext. Bridge can result in massive backups into downtown JC. I had to drive into JC when the skyway was closed and took me an hour and a half to get up the hill. Hmmmmm. I have only lived here my whole life and for the first 25 of it, right near that bridge, and my parents are still there, and never heard it called that. But you must be right. I guess my dad, born in Bayonne Hospital, isn’t local enough to know what the locals call it.\\nEdited: 2:40 pm, July 12, 2021 I haven\\'t been to NYC in decades, and my spouse has never been, so we are in the pre-planning phase of a possible trip next May, and I have lots of questions (and yes, I have looked over the \"top Qs\"). My first concern is navigating from the airport to the hotel (probably mid-town) with luggage (and back). I\\'ve done the public transport thing in a few other cities, and some are relatively easy with luggage, and some can be a major hassle. I\\'m not wealthy, but I am willing to pay a little bit more for the convenience of not having to negotiate public transport that I am not familiar with while hauling luggage, sometimes up and down stairs (and we are no longer \"spring chickens\"). Is there a better airport to fly into (ignoring pricing)? Any advice on that?\\nEdited: 4:58 pm, July 10, 2021 From JFK; it\\'s a fixed rate for a taxi to Manhattan.\\nFron Newark, a tired fee which is dictated on where you\\'ll be staying (info on this can be found on the airport homepage).\\nIf one airport has a better price / time for your flight, I would let that determine which airport to choose. LGA is a bit closer to midtown so the cab/car service costs can be cheaper.\\nHowever, depending on your starting point with the US, non-stop flights may not be available. (LGA has a perimeter limit on flights so Denver is the farthest west for non-stops https://qns.com/2021/06/lawmaker-passes-bill-codifying-laguardia-perimeter-rule-in-an-effort-to-reduce-airplane-noise-in-northeast-queens/ ) I’m not wealthy either, I also don’t have a choice from Albuquerque with jet blue nonstop, so I always fly into JFK.\\nI always spring for a taxi both ways from Manhattan. It’s well worth the price. I can sit back and relax it takes me straight to my hotel door. Otherwise in the city. I take public transportation everywhere. Thank you all. I read that taxi service to midtown is currently $52 flat from JFK, and $40-60 from LGA, so anywhere from $20-30 per person (plus tip). That sounds reasonable for an hour plus drive door to door and not having to hassle with luggage on a public transit system we are not familiar with. I agree CaminoMundo, that once in the city, the subway system should be just fine to navigate - that I\\'ve done in the past! We\\'ll probably pick up the 7-day Unlimited MetroCard (again to keep things simple). We\\'ve used Uber in other cities pre-COVID, but I am reading that ride-sharing rates have risen dramatically over the past couple of years and aren\\'t reliably cheaper than good taxi service in cities like NYC. Gotta add in tolls and tip even for JFK which is a flat rate. If you have concerns with luggage etc then taking a taxi is probably for the best. I mostly use public transit and don\\'t have any issues although I can easily carry my luggage up a flight of stairs if need be, but sometimes after an ultra long flight I just spring for the taxi. One of the things I would consider is just how close does public transit get you to your hotel and if multiple transfers are required or not. The more convoluted or time consuming it looks the more likely a taxi will be worth the money.\\nEdited: 4:40 pm, July 11, 2021 The total taxi fare to/from JFK is $70-75 when you add tolls and tip for the driver. My teenage daughter and I are visiting NYC later in the year. We arrive at JFK very late so will get a cab into Manhattan. However, our return flight leaves at 10pm on a Monday, which means getting off Manhattan in the rush hour. I am looking at the subway (we are staying 2 blocks from the E subway line) or a cab to Penn and then the LIRR. HOW awful will these be at these times with a suitcase each? Would waiting to 6.30pm make any difference? Many thanks for your help. E train to Queens at 8am is pretty empty (E train to Manhattan at 8am is packed like a sardine can) Many thanks for that info. In fact we\\'ll be travelling TO JFK early evening. Could you say at what time does the E towards Queens become bearable? Nobody knows the answer to this because nobody knows what the state of the city will be in October. By the Fall we could be in another wave of covid cases, which would likely cause more vehicles to be on the road and less people on the trains or if the vaccines hold up against the variants there could be a lot more people commuting home on trains from their offices at that time. We just don\\'t know because everything will be dictated by the conditions on the ground at the time. We will have a much better idea of what the situation will be like in mid to late September. You don\\'t say where in Manhattan you are starting from so we don\\'t know how far you have to travel in traffic to get to penn station. Assuming pre-pandemic rush hours are in effect I would strongly suggest skipping the subway and just using the LIRR since you have luggage. It will not be a comfortable ride on the subway during rush hour with luggage. When going back to the airport, I like to take either a cab or a car service for ease of travelling with suitcases. Especially at rush hour. Both will be around $70 in total once you figure in taxes and tips. Dial 7 is a good car service, and will pick you up at the hotel. Check for any discount promo\\'s they\\'re having.\\nOtherwise, at rush hour I would consider the LIRR over the subway for a cheaper trip than a cab or car. Would not advise using a car service or taxi to go to the airport during rush hour unless you don\\'t mind sitting in traffic and it taking longer to get there. I do advice taking a taxi with luggage even at rush hour. SO convenient.\\nI always take the same flight out of Manhattan and I always have to depart @ latest at 4:10 PM.\\nI always have gotten a cab or more frequent a car service. So over the many times I’ve done this over last ten years 2 X a year -the ride takes 60 minutes ,sometimes longer but never longer than 1 hour 20 minutes by car.\\nI’ve never been later than 5:30 PM to the airport even during a terrific rainstorm with thunder.\\nCar services and cabs have taken all sorts of routes depending on where my hotel, the 59th St. bridge, Williamsburg Bridge ( Most often) & the Queens Midtown Tunnel.\\nMy hotel is usually on the east side of Manhattan. The time I stayed far West Midtown it took 1 hour 20\\nMinutes , that was by cab.\\nLately, I use lower Eastside car services TO JFK when I stay on the east side and below 14th St. It’s 50 bucks to the airport and there’s no extra fees only a tip. Thats the downtown departure rate.\\nThey have been a reliable car service for me, never late, not once. I Call the night before.\\nhttp://www.lescarservices.com/index.html I\\'d say it\\'s a simple decision ->> which do you want: comfort or price - and then budget the time needed.\\nIf price and transit time predictability >> LIRR to Air Train. Check the LIRR schedule - and budget ~45 minutes from the time the train leaves Penn. With one bag each, you should be fine.\\nIf comfort - get a car service - and just budget 90 minutes to get to the airport from a midtown hotel (2 hours if you want to be super conservative - but I think that\\'s overkill).\\nLast note >> Re-check status closer to your trip to see the situation has significantly changed - possibly suggesting an adjustment to the 90 minutes above. \"- possibly suggesting an adjustment to the 90 minutes above.\" - This sounds plausible. OP wasn\\'t even asking about taking a taxi or car service to the airport but if it is something OP considers what transit times were pre-pandemic are not going to be indicative of what they will be this fall. There was a survey last week that had NYC surpassing Los Angeles for the worst traffic congestion in the country and we don\\'t even have all the people going back to work in the office yet. We are already back to pre-pandemic traffic levels and one of the big questions about what happens in the fall when more companies go back to the office is what percentage of people will drive instead of using mass transit before. Add into that the significant increase in home deliveries and all the trucks that brings and rush hour traffic could become worse than it has been in recent memory. By mid-September we should have a much better idea about traffic times. >>>If comfort - get a car service - and just budget 90 minutes to get to the airport from a midtown hotel (2 hours if you want to be super conservative - but I think that\\'s overkill).<<<\\nI agree. Not just comfort though the convenience of not having to haul your bags at all and not to *worry* about if subway will be crowded and how difficult it will be with bags for stairs crowds ect.\\nNo the Op didnt ask about specifically about a car service, but they did ask in reference to Subway and LIRR:\\n“HOW awful will these be at these times with a suitcase each?…”\\nEdited: 10:21 pm, July 11, 2021 Just an FYI, if you purchase tickets to the virtual reality experience at the Harry Potter Store, you get a timed entry to the VR experience and thus the store. That way you do not need to get to the store at 7am to scan the QR code for spot in the virtual queue. I got my ticket for the first week of August and now I get to sleep in that day too! Awesome! Thanks for the info! I have 4 hours layover at JFK before our flight to Paris. I have never been to NYC. Our luggage will be transferred to our international flight. Should I plan on go to the city or it’s not enough time? Not enough time\\nI would not leave the airport No where near enough time. However, a while back, someone once recommended to someone else in your position that they take the air train that circles the airport to the Howard Beach stop, and there was a spot that I believe is walkable where you would have good views of Manhattan. I don\\'t recall the exact location and instructions. That would be feasible and should be the only thing you consider, anything else is too risky in that short of a time period.\\nIf anyone reading this recalls the exact instructions, that would be helpful. ***Not enough time\\nI would not leave the airport***\\n+1 I remember that thread it was from JWanderer. I dont think there is a spot to see manahattan Skyline from Howard Beach. There is a spot from the Belt Parkway by Canarsie that you can see a Glimpse of the Manhattan Skyline that is pretty close to JFK, but I wouldnt really recomend doing that Thank you all. That’s helpful. If I want to have a “ taste of NY” while in terminal what do you recommend? If My memory is wrong and you can’t do it at Howard Beach, then at best you can go to the twa hotel at the airport, have a drink, and plan to come again. I share your frustration. I remember having a long layover in Paris a few years ago, but nothing enough time to go into the city. I had a cafe au lait and a croissant and probably bought a French fashion magazine.\\nEdited: 12:04 am, July 11, 2021 Go visit the TWA terminal at JFK. It’s lots of fun. I also once had a 5 hour layover in Paris and I had never been to the city on a stopover to Israel. I said to myself if Iever went to Israel again I would make sure to have a longer stopover on Paris and sure enough the next year I went to Israel again and I made sure to have a 3 day stopover in Paris. OP There will be other times to come to NYC, It aint going nowhere 4 hours is not enough time, check with your airline and see what their requirements are before boarding. See below, updated July 9, 2021.\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnn.com/travel/amp/france-travel-covid-19/index.html I found a spot where this MIGHT be possible, You would need approximatly an hour to do this and that includes time getting the cab. Meaning the car service would have to be waiting for you, , take you to this spot, Wait for you and take you back to the airport.\\nAccording to google maps this spot is 9 miles from JFK, but Ive driven it frequently and unless it about 5-6 pm going to Brooklyn, its only about a 15-20 minute drive each way (Meaning you have about 20 mins in this area).\\nHere is the spot on google maps\\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/place/Canarsie+Skate+Park/@40.6258075,-73.9042941,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c25cd29dcd9d79:0x4215cad77b91a466!8m2!3d40.6257426!4d-73.9005643\\nthat water area called Paerdaget Basin (Nobody would know that name of that body of water, I never heard of it myself until now) has a view of the NYC skyline in the far distance. If you go to that Skate park and walk towards the water you will see the skyline in the distance. That area is pretty safe.\\nYou are going to have to find a car service and plan this in advance as not many people would know this area (Ive driven through it sometimes as its a shortccut to parts of Brooklyn)\\nWhether its worth your time for a far glimpse of the NYC (and its far, Like 15 miles) for what Id say would be around $100, thats up to you.

Hello,\\nSo I plan on flying out of LGA in October and I wanted to use the LIRR plus Q70 SBS bus to get there. I have been to NYC many times, but not to Woodside. I passed by Woodside on the way to a Mets game on the LIRR, but never got off at Woodside. I picked the LIRR over the subway since I don\\'t get a lot of opportunities to ride the LIRR. Is the Woodside LIRR/7 station and the area around the Woodside Q70 SBS bus stop safe? This trip would be happening around 5 PM.\\nThanks in advance.

I’d like to watch with a crowd but I don’t think I’m ready to jam shoulder to shoulder into a sports bar yet :-) Contact the people at The Ground.

What I would is, if yhou are looking at a hop on hop off bus, take that as a full look (don\\'t get off until you are back to your starting point) to see what interests. Also, they usually give you a map so that you can see where things are. When you get to your hotel, check the front desk to see if they have one of those free tourism magazines to see what you might like to do. KVa, where are you coming from? Knowing your frame of reference (big city/small town…west coast/south/Midwest/etc) can be super-helpful in narrowing down things that may seem cool/different. Also knowing a bit more about what you and your daughter enjoy. History? Street art? Parks? Etc… Coming from Huntsville Alabama.\\nShe’s into art, anime, interactive type experiences.\\nWe don’t really have an agenda. Just excited to go and experience it. Since you\\'re staying in Midtown and your daughter enjoys art, you could check out the new public art by Hilary Pecis in Rockefeller Center https://www.rockefellercenter.com/magazine/arts-culture/art-in-focus-spotlight-hilary-pecis/ and Sanford Biggers\\' work, Oracle, comes down on July 12th I think, so you could catch that before it comes down... www.gesso.app has an audio walking tour about it as well.\\nNew York Botanical Garden currently has really cool installations by Yayoi Kusama: https://www.nybg.org/event/kusama/\\nthere\\'s also the Immersive Van Gogh exhibit which I think you have to get tickets to in advance: https://www.vangoghnyc.com/ Some fun ideas in the links below.

Blindness is recommended for age 15 and up. Oops! I forgot to check the minimum age. Thanks for the carch. This story in The NY Times is about the city when we had no tourists.\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/nyregion/new-york-city-tourism.html\\nIt was wonderful. No crowds. I could take a run through the park when the gyms closed and not dodge scrums of tourists. On my morning commute I would walk through Times Square or Rock Center and it was almost tranquil. For the brief period of time that restaurants reopened for indoor dining, I had no trouble getting a reservation for the places that were open. It was this weird combination of feeling like you were in some post apocalyptic setting but in a magical place at the same time. Maine also had that for a while. Then all of the New Yorkers showed up. 😊 I was in Bar Harbor, ME last summer, it was a ghost town. It was pretty awesome Montreal was also a ghost town for a while, we even had a curfew for the longest time that ended on May 28th after almost 6 months. Yes SloppyEats, I had the same wonderful experience of having the town to myself, minus tourists, for a period of time in Charleston, SC. Unfortunately we were wide open when much of the rest of the east coast was closed and we then got swamped with not just tourists, but covid deniers who couldn\\'t be bothered with masks because they were on vacation. Also people who don\\'t understand the concept of a city, where streets and sidewalks are crowded, because they come from a rural area, didn\\'t see any reason to wear a mask outside. And then our restaurants all got packed, making it difficult to get in anywhere good - a great time for the crappier places that thrive on one time visit tourist business. Crossing streets (even the West Side Highway) without looking for traffic! No problems staying 6 feet apart when you were the only person on the whole block. Then the weirdness early this spring of seeing one lone food cart on the street and realizing they had all been missing for all that time. The clean air - that’s what I loved the most. It was so extraordinary to breathe in and feel fresh, soot-free air come in. And I recall standing in the middle of the street looking uptown, it was if a camera lens had out the vista in new focus. It’s hard to describe what a difference a few months of exhaust-free living made in the quality of the air. Tampa was wonderful too. It was like the 80s. Now housing is out of control, the roads are so crowded with so many people having moved here or in the process of moving here. Everyone has their ups and downs. Hmm, I may be misinterpreting since I didn’t read the article, but it may have been better for some but what about those who depend on tourism/ tourists for their livelihood? let me add....while the lack of traffic etc was nice, we certainly appreciate the importance of the tourist dollars to the overall economy!!! I cannot even begin to imagine what these scenes must have been like in person.\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/watch-new-yorkers-horrifically-swim-through-the-subway-station-last-night-070921?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Facebook&cid=~newyork~natsoc~facebook~echobox&fbclid=IwAR38N13cufxGEvcQ2-Uk78C3ei2pMDkme_YtwM9r3MCBW7ettLWxaOyUPgA#Echobox=1625845262 Amazing - and a bit scarry. Thanks for sharing. It appears to me that the water in the stations is coming in via flooded streets up above. Must have been an incredibly heavy rainfall event that is way outside of typical scenarios.\\nYou my remember a few years ago when Hurricane Harvey dumped over 50” of rain in four days over my hometown of Houston. No amount of normal flood control can hold that back and we had massive damage. I hope this drains away without causing major lasting outages like Superstorm Sandy. Yes, even though people may not really notice them, on many below ground stations there is usually a small step up from the sidewalk at the top of the stairs that diverts \"normal\" run off.\\n\"Even on a dry day, the MTA says it pumps 14 million gallons of water out of subway stations.\" https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/7/9/22570630/nyc-subway-flooding-bigger-than-mta-climate-change\\nScott - Did you move to the new location you mentioned previously? Kaye, I am moving there on July 31. Scott that\\'s great.\\nOnce you get settled be sure to check out that Victorian spa town I mentioned Hi Friends,\\nIt will be our visit to NYC after 18 years, and first for our 11 yo daughter.\\nLooking for hotel recommendations (not Times Sq location please), budget is ~$300 a night.\\nWould appreciate your help!\\nThank you We need your dates of travel as hotel rates vary by date & your desired bedding configuration. we are planning to arrive on 9/1 and leave on 9/6.\\nWe like some nice place, not very noisy (LOL), breakfast in the hotel would be a plus. I would not suggest travel at this time with an 11 yr old unless he/she is COVID vaccinated by travel time. There are thousands and thousands of travelers in airports, in planes and here in the city whose status is unknown, and a lot of them, including children obviously well under 12, are wandering around without masks. There are also pockets of NYC with very very low vaccination rates (like barely 30%) because of superstitions about fertility, etc. imported from home countries, and many of the people holding these views have low wage jobs in service sector -- hotels, restaurants, etc. And if you insist on coming, try to find a hotel that guarantees all its employees are vaccinated and eat outside at restaurants.\\nEdited: 8:59 pm, July 10, 2021 ***There are thousands and thousands of travelers in airports, in planes and here in the city whose status is unknown, and a lot of them, including children obviously well under 12, are wandering around without masks.***\\nI just flew back home here after being away for a few weeks, the above is true. It was refreshing to see people traveling and enjoying themselves.\\nCheck the Hampton Inn on W24th, looks like their pricing comes in near to your budget for your dates. Usually hotel breakfast is nothing to speak about, so inquire with whatever hotel you choose from. But you\\'re coming to a place where it\\'s easy to get any kind of breakfast you want within walking distance of your hotel. We are staying at riu plaza Times Square what’s the b st transfer to cape liberty port the from port to jfk finding it difficult any help thanks Taxi/Uber/car service.\\nA local Bayonne taxi is sometimes cheaper than a car service.\\nThere’s no easy way to get from Bayonne to JFK. If you wanted to take public transportation, it would involve multiple transfers and at least two hours. Check w the cruise company to see if they have a message board where you can join with others to share a cab. That cruise port is very poorly served by public transport http://www.cruiseliberty.com/passenger_info.html#transportation\\nA car service, such as Dial 7, Carmel or Uber, is best for both journeys Here are the answers to your previously posted question https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13599676-Transfer_times_sq_to_cape_liberty_cruise_terminal-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nEdited: 4:40 pm, July 10, 2021 Definitely car service of some type as mentioned, forget about public transportation from there. We have an 8 hour layover (8:30 am-4:30 pm), domestic flights, this Sunday. Our family of 6 (kids 8-17 years) has never been to NYC. Can you suggest a doable itinerary to see some family friendly places? We love the idea of showing our kids the 911 memorial and seeing the castle in Central Park. Friends recommended Bethesda Fountain. What’s the best way to spend our short time there and what’s the best transportation choices for our bigger group? You dont have 8 Hours, you have about 4 Hours\\nIt will take bout an hour each way between JFK and Central Park and its about a 20 Mins walk from the nearest Subway Station to Bethesda Fountain and thats if you know the way, Its about another 10-15 walk from Bethesda Fountain to the Castle and then 20 MIn to the Subway. This IMO is not doable.\\nIMO Times Square and seeing the Empire State Building is doable if you take the LIRR to Penn Station from the JFK airtrain and walk 10-15 mins to Times Square\\nWTC Might be possible too, if you take the Airtrain to HOWARD BEACH and then take A train to WTC station. its about an hour too Thank you. I figured we had about 4 hours max. Do you know if Google Maps is reliable in NYC to find our way around? Do you know if there are any taxi/car services that can take 6 people? Belive it or not, NYC is in the 21st Century, everything works. Personally I use WAZE not Google maps\\n6 people you need to reserve a special car. Carmel Car service I think offers that Will your luggage be checked through? If not, you may be too early to check in your bags for your second flight when you land from your first flight. I use Citymapper app to get around in NYC, it\\'s reliable. My wife prefers googlemaps.\\nGives options of transport including walking or a combination. Isn\\'t WAZE GPS for driving only?\\n6 ppl is too many for one cab. You could split up and take 2 taxis. There are some NYC Yellow cab minivans that will hold 6. But, I think you have to wait until one just randomly shows up.\\nDial 7 and Carmel are 2 car services that are frequently recommended. You can order a minivan. Check their websites.\\nEdited: 11:09 pm, July 09, 2021 For 4 hours I am not sure what you want to see. Are you wanting a museum or something to see the city like Times Square or something? I use google maps exclusively and don\\'t have any major issues. I don\\'t know what other maps offer. It doesn\\'t really concern me. I know all the streets, so I just use google maps to see the cross streets and where on the block my destination is or what the closest subway station is to me and I am fine getting there. I have had some issues with google maps in international cities, so it is a fair question to raise.\\nIn terms of how to spend your four hours I don\\'t think the 9/11 memorial and central park are the best things to combine. You waste a lot of time travelling that way. Go to midtown and combine it with either heading south to see the 9/11 memorial or heading north to see central park. I would consider something like taking the train from jamaica station into Penn station and then walking east to herald square past macys, to the ESB (and maybe koreatown on east 32nd and then head north on fifth avenue past the public library (can duck into grand central if you want) [you could also cut west here to visit times square] continue north past rock center and up into central park. Head north along the eastern part of central park then cut over west and head back down south to columbus circle or over to the west side to Lincoln center etc and then hop a subway train back to penn station for the commute back to the airport.\\nAgain it depends on your interest but try to plan a route that has you easily circling back to where you can catch the train if you opt for that option. If you group is slow moving then maybe all that walking won\\'t work and you would be better off simply picking two neighborhoods not super far from eachother to explore.\\nThe route you take is up to you. Or you could take a subway from penn station when you arrive from the airport and head down to the 9/11 memorial and work your way back up thru tribeca, soho,washington square park, the village, chelsea, visit chelsea market take the high line up to the vessel and hudson yards and head over to penn station from there.\\nEdited: 3:17 am, July 10, 2021 I would head down to the 9/11 Memorial, then back up to the Bryant Park/NY Library area(great photo ops) and then Times Square. Maybe grab something to eat and then start heading back to the airport.\\nYou can always kill some time checking out the TWA Hotel if you get back early.\\n9/11 and Central Park would be a stretch...time wise...especially not knowing your way around. Your group will not fit in one Yellow cab or a standard car service vehicle https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/passenger-frequently-asked-questions.page (No cab can hold 6 unless one is a small child. Most hold 4 + 1 lap child.)\\nHere\\'s the subway map so you can see the transit routes mentioned above https://new.mta.info/map/5256\\nYou\\'ll need to prioritize, keep an eye on the clock and be prepared to head back when needed\\nTake a look here to see the things downtown (9/11 Memorial, view of SOL from Battery Park, etc) https://downtownny.com/explore/plan-your-trip/must-see-downtown/\\nOne possibly might be to take the Airtrain + A train to High Street Brooklyn. Then walk the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan and see the downtown sights. (Not sure if you\\'d then have enough to time left to see things farther uptown.) The point about luggage is an important one. If you are on separate tickets, you will need to store your luggage, then retrieve it in time for check in. Even if that isn\\'t an issue, you will have to store your carry-on bags or lug them around with you. Our family a group of 16 will be in NYC in two weeks. I am the planning type as husband and I love to travel. I am a little concerned that we haven’t made reservations for the Statue of Liberty and museums. How important are advanced reservations? We plan on purchasing the sightseeing pass for the 6 days that we are there. Sightseeing passes in general are not that great to begin with. Plan your itinerary first, then check to see if the pass works for what you want to do - not the other way around.\\nFor SOL, make reservations directly with Statue Cruised, the official place to get them. Very important. Particularly for a group your size. Verify *IF* any pass you are considering now offers any way to reserve in advance.\\nPreviously that was (and perhaps still is) a problem. When you exchange your vouchers a convenient admission time may not be available You have a large group and that might make it hard to begin with.\\nAs mentioned, SOL/EI, the official seller is Statue Cruises, only buy from them. What is the safest and most cost effective way to get from LGA to JFK ? I won\\'t have a ton of luggage and I won\\'t be rushing to make connecting flights on the same day, but also don\\'t want to spent a lot of money on the transportation cost if it can be helped. How many hours do you have?\\nWhich day of the week and time of day?\\nIs this on one ticket so you have some protection if you miss your connection?\\nThere is an inexpensive transit connection but it requires two trains and a bus. (Q70 bus + E train + Airtrain https://new.mta.info/map/5256 )\\nEdited: 10:22 am, July 10, 2021 Looking for the most direct connection. If there is a direct shuttle bus or something - great. My connecting flight is the next day so I have time but I don’t want to spend hours getting between the two airports. Due to covid, the shared ride services are still suspended https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides Don\\'t know when that might change\\nDo you intend to spend the layover time at JFK? https://www.sleepinginairports.net/guides/new-york-city-jfk-airport-guide.htm\\nIf you have the time, the neighborhood around the transfer point between the bus and E train is an interesting place for look around and a meal https://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods/queens/jackson-heights/ Hi there!\\nThis will be our first trip back to NY in 15 years - and wanted to make it very special since we\\'ll be celebrating my birthday and our anniversary. Hoping to get some suggestions on where to stay and maybe a special restaurant for dinner one night?\\nThanks so much!!!\\nJan Do you have any food preferences (likes / dislikes)? My husband loves steak and/or italian food\\nAny ideas where to stay as well?? In order to give you a good hotel recommendation, we need exact dates of travel (hotel rates vary daily) , budget (in US$ if you\\'re from the US) including 15% taxes) & bedding configuration.\\nAs for food, what is your budget/entree? If you want a steak house type place: American Cut or Cote are two options that would work for a celebtation.\\nSo many good Italian places, I\\'m sure I\\'m missing many, but a few suggestions (some might have some good meat options but I wouldn\\'t know - I typically order pasta / fish / seafood when eating in Italian restaurants) are the below ones. Some are quite casual others a bit more festive but I\\'ve enjoyed them all for various reasons.\\nBabbo - fun, lively atmosphere\\nMaialino - beautiful room\\nBar Pitti - very low-key, local place, but with a good vibe and sometimes interesting people\\nPiccolo Cucina Osteria - very good local spot with Scicilian flavors. It sounds like the brand-spanking-new Carne Mare, \"an Italian chophouse,\" is exactly what you\\'re looking for. https://www.carnemare.com/\\nSteak, pasta, Italian Specialties AND the bonus of gorgeous views.\\nCaveat: I haven\\'t been there myself yet. You can get some good reccos on where to stay and specific hotels here. But, it does help to give a budget per night and dates at the least.\\nWhere did you stay 15 years ago? Did you like that location?\\nI really like to stay in the flatiron district/ nomad because it has good restaurants, is pretty, there are lots of hotels (plus ones I can afford) and has good public transit access. Its location is easy for uptown and downtown things IMO.\\nI don’t like midtown in general that much or the theater district/Times square . The latter is too crowed/hectic and I find the food options more expensive.\\nSo with a little bit of info what YOU like, you will get some better hotel or neighborhood suggestions. Gage and Tollner, an historic Brooklyn restaurant has reopened to good reviews, another restaurant idea.\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/2021/5/7/22423302/gage-tollner-restaurant-edna-lewis-dishes-first-look-menu-critic-brooklyn\\nFor a hotel, we\\'d need an idea of dates and budget and what you\\'d like. American Cut (TriBeCa location) and Bowery Meat Company are both modern steak houses with great steaks.\\nFrenchette also has a Steak Frites dish that\\'s probably cheaper than many steak houses yet it\\'s still very good. Lovely setting inside too. The main dining room at the back in particular. **Gage and Tollner, an historic Brooklyn restaurant has reopened to good reviews, another restaurant idea.**\\nI live 5 min away and was thinking of going last weekend. Didn\\'t make it. I remember the change that location has gone through since the original G&T closed.\\nThis may be an option paired with a walk(before/after) over the Bklyn Bridge.\\nThe area is nothing special(Fulton St/retail), but I saw pics of the inside of the restaurant and they did a nice job. To celebrate my 2022 grad we are taking him on a solo trip without his 4 siblings on US trip of his choice....and he picked NYC. Plan is likely to go around Christmas. He\\'s a big musical theater fan (like my husband and myself) but other than several Broadway shows I would love to know places teens especially enjoy. We were hoping to go to the Broadway Museum but read hat isn\\'t open yet. It\\'s will be my husband and my 5th NYC trip but don\\'t mind repeating some of our favorites, too. I would buy your teenager a guide book & let them take the lead in planning the trip. I agree with letting your kid make choices. I have two teens in NYC and their favorite things are very different. Off-Broadway can have some wonderful shows with smaller theaters and a more intimate vibe.\\nTake a look and see if anything appeals: https://www.playbill.com/productions?q=&venue-type=offbroadway&zip=\\nAlso check the Broadway tab on that site for the bigger productions. **I would buy your teenager a guide book & let them take the lead in planning the trip.**\\n^\\nThis.\\nAlso, have him do some internet research.\\nWhat places teens enjoy may not be what your teen may enjoy. Outside of musical theater, you don\\'t specify anything else about him.\\nSports fan? Sneakerhead? Photography? Foodie? History buff? Etc? NYC has it all.\\nI go back to the first response...I would have him take the lead on planning based on what he would like to do/see. I am having withdrawal symptoms because I have been away from New York City for a two and a half years. I am still hoping that the US-Canada border will open on July 21. I read a lot about what is happening in New York City and have seen the following article that there will be continued outdoor dining in New York:\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/xz2hhp58\\nI live in Montreal, we have outdoor dining, but not during colder months and not as much as New York City. The only time I experienced outdoor dining in New York City was once on a rooftop and once at Sarabeth.\\nI\\'ve been looking at pictures and webcams where I can see all the new installations for outdoor dining and am so looking forward to trying some out.\\nAnyone else? I\\'m ok with outdoor dining during the pandemic, but it is not convenient in some neighborhoods and hopefully will be gone once the pandemic is over. Literally walking through makeshit dining rooms on the sidewalk and having to go single file and sometimes having to push through crowds of people waiting for a table is a bit much for those who live in the neighborhood. The more people who come back to the city the worse it is going to get. The other day a cab jumped the curb in my neighborhood and took down some outdoor diners. Thankfully it wasn\\'t peak time because someone easily could have been killed.\\nA few weeks ago going past a dive bar I almost got into a fight with some \"outdoor diners\" when they tried to confront me for not having a cigarette to give them. Don\\'t need more drunks hanging out on sidewalks.\\nEdited: 8:19 pm, July 08, 2021 We live in Greenwich Village and have eaten outside a few times in the past few weeks at restaurants in our neighborhood. It feels like life has been restored.\\nCH I concur with Red. Outdoor dining was a way to help restaurants get through the lockdown rules. The rules are gone and it\\'s time to undo the associated stuff.\\nEdited: 8:35 pm, July 08, 2021 EricH_DC, is there an increased number of restaurants with outdoor dining in DC as there is in New York City?\\nEdited: 10:59 pm, July 08, 2021 Most New Yorkers love it I saw the webcam on Mulberry street and it looks nice. I am also looking forward to seeing what it looks like around soho and I don\\'t know if the installation at The Greens is permanent but it does look beautiful. Yes, many restaurants in DC set up outdoor facilities, but some are beginning to cut back or eliminate them. On wider sidewalks or streets they are less obstructive, but the crowd noise and music (some have pumped in music outside) are obnoxious. They have also provided the rat population a feast for over a year now.\\nBut it may look nice from afar to people who don\\'t have to live with it. Agree with Damon that most New Yorkers love it. It’s also true that many of the outdoor sheds were originally pretty improvisational; some still are. But that’s because no one knew how long the Open Restaurants program was going to last. If it becomes permanent, as I very much hope it does, restaurants will continue to improve their set-ups.\\nIMO the solution to sidewalk crowding & safety (per #1) is to expand pedestrian areas (the way the Open Streets program does), but that requires reducing car traffic & storage (i.e., removing on-street parking spaces), and that’s a long battle. NYC is pretty retrograde compared with a lot of other cities in that respect.\\nSure, we all have our least-favorite outdoor dining structure we like to grumble about - there’s one near me for a restaurant that’s always been primarily take-out and, sure enough, their shed sits empty while encroaching on half the sidewalk - but overall it’s great.\\nHope you can come and experience it all soon, jcmtl! JCMTL, you know you can fly to NYC now? And assuming you are vaccinated you don’t have to quarantine when you get home. I’m not doing it for many more months (all other issues aside, travelling contrary to a government travel advisory voids my travel insurance) but it is technically possible. Yes MeeMee I know I can fly to New York as I am fully vaccinated for more than 2 weeks. The only thing that is stopping me is the cost of the ticket that has almost tripled. I would rather drive to Albany and take the train there. I will wait and hopefully will see the the outdoor dining installations very soon. I don\\'t know if this has been shared yet or not, but I found a great site to learn about the art at Moynihan Train Hall. I especially appreciated the Stan Douglas photos and their descriptions of historical events that occurred at Penn Station. I cannot wait until my next trip to the city to see these when I step off the Amtrak train!\\nhttps://www.publicartfund.org/exhibitions/view/mth/ Thanks for this. We are arriving to NY from DC via train and will get to see the Moynihan Hall. Very exciting.\\nClaudia Well, what you get to see depends on where you leave the train. If it is towards the front, you may find yourself in the old Penn Station. Moynihan is at the back end. Nothing could be more fitting for a great metropolitan transit hub than three astonishing works of art that stop us in our tracks,\" said Nicholas Baume, Director & Chief Curator of Public Art Fund. \"Each one dazzles with its sheer beauty, epic scale, and technical mastery. Collectively, they also remind us that great art comes from great ideas. Each artist has thought deeply about the history, context, significance, and future of this newly transformed place, creating brilliantly innovative works of art that allow us to see ourselves—past, present, and future—in a truly civic space.” We were there a few weekends ago and wow, what a difference from Penn Station.

I will be taking a train out of this station and I am guessing the waiting from is for amtrak ticket holders only? Anthony R, you guessed correctly (I also responded on your thread). Thank you, Jenny! I\\'ve bookmarked that website. I always like finding the hidden art/history gems. My pleasure Action .... We’re coming up tomorrow to take the ferry to the Statue of Liberty. I’d prefer to park near the Battery since we’d also be able to see Brooklyn Bridge that way. However, we’re in a truck that has a lift on it, and that can make parking in garages difficult. Are there outdoor parking lots nearby or garages that accommodate taller than average vehicles? Maybe look into NJ or even possibly Staten Island, depending on where you\\'re coming from, as a place to leave the vehicle before proceeding into the city.\\nAs you can see from my response, I don\\'t know the answer to your question.\\nEdited: 4:58 pm, July 09, 2021 You\\'ll have to check schedules, but you could park at the New Jersey ferry terminal for the Statue of Liberty at Liberty Landing and then return to Manhattan. In Manhattan you could go over to the Brooklyn Bridge and do whatever else you want. Then end up by taking the ferry from Manhattan to New Jersey that will take you to Liberty Landing. Do you have commercial plates on the truck?\\nIf a vehicle has commerical plates they are allowed to park on the streets of Manhattan.\\nIf not then you have to go to Liberty State Park in NJ No, we do not have commercial plates. I found this parking garage that allows oversized vehicles. Unless I’m missing something, this seems like a good option as long as I make a reservation.\\nBattery Park Parking Lot - MPG Parking. 75 2nd pl. They are going to charge you alot of money, and I mean alot of money. Id guess $50-$75 or more The rate online is $25 for a regular vehicle, and $35 for an oversized vehicle.\\nhttps://mpgparking.com/parking-spots\\nEdited: 9:56 pm, July 09, 2021 It might not even fit. Downtown Manhattan is some of the oldest parts of the US, the streets are very narrow (Not a good place to be driving a truck) and the parking garages are very small. It might not fit\\nYou should really re-consider and park at Liberty State Park in NJ (Its outdoor Parking lot and its free) Does the parking garage have a website? They should list maximum height. If not, then just call and ask Thanks everyone. We did end up reconsidering, and just made our reservations for the New Jersey side. That large open parking lot sealed the deal for us. That would have worked. The streets are fine around that location. The tighter streets are Nassau St, Pine, Cedar, Maiden Lane…around there. But trucks make it through all of the time. The parking lot you found would have been fine. Interesting. Thanks for your post. Pretty sure I have been on metro trains in other cities that were carpeted. Unfortunately, I don\\'t think people in NYC are capable of keeping trains clean so it probably would never work here. Someone always bringing on food and drinks and spilling it all over the place. how much is uber from eastern long island to j f k airport and is it foolproof Just turn on uber. You can check the live prices without ordering a ride.\\nBut pls keep in mind that the prices can vary. Depending on time and availabity Millions of people use it every week. Is it foolproof? We have booked Uber’s that never showed up but the same has happened with taxis.\\nIf you have never used it, try it first for something local, instead of something important like an airport trip.\\n“Eastern Long Island” is kind of vague, and time of day and traffic also affects price. Have you considered taking the Long Island Rail Road to Jamaica, and then the AirTrain to your JFK terminal? Never had an issue with an uber not showing up. Prices will vary so nobody can tell you that, since its based on conditions at the time. If I was going to take a car to the airport I would look into a car service that way you know well in advance what the cost will be and you know you likely won\\'t be waiting around for a car to arrive. Not sure I understand the last post, I had multiple trouble with Ubers not showing up in DC a few years ago. I refused to use it again until recently and it has worked better, but I wouldn\\'t give it more than a \"B\" grade \"Not sure I understand the last post,\" Pretty self explanatory. I never had an issue with an uber not showing up when using them in NY. I can\\'t speak to uber availability in DC which may be drastically different than NY. Is it possible an uber won\\'t show up in NY? Sure it is possible but I have never run into that issue. Like I suggested a car service would be a better idea for a more time certain departure and knowing the price ahead of time. I am glad it worked for you. We had cars turn around short of our location in DC or just speed on by.\\nHad no issues in Orlando\\nIn St. Louis last month we had 2 good ones and one that went right past us and parked 2 blocks away so we had to lug our luggage on a steamy morning to his car. For those reasons I\\'ll use a cab when I can instead of Uber.\\nIn NYC we walk or take the subway. LIRR probably makes most sense for OP here Unusual question here- We (myself, daughter and her fiancé) will be coming to NYC in less than two weeks. The main purpose of the trip is to take engagement photos of them in various locations throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn over several days. We have our favorite photography locations picked out.\\nI\\'d really love to find a cool wall mural or painted wall with the word \\'Brooklyn\\' on it close to DUMBO, Brooklyn Bridge Park/Brooklyn Heights. I see on Google maps that Brooklyn Sun & Air at the corner of S. 4th & Driggs has just that. That location is an 11 minute walk from Domino Park, one of the locations we will be taking photos at. I realize there is no guarantee as to what the wall looks like currently, but we\\'ll check it out. I also know that from my last two visits in April and May of this year, that some of my very favorite murals have been ruined with graffiti spray over them.\\nI\\'d welcome any suggestions on other walls with either Brooklyn or New York on them. I\\'m sure there are more out there.\\nThanks! I have some good spots for you, for photos\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPOSKsFNHeA/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPIe8gkN2DC/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/COG0qMOLr82/\\nThis one says Queens\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CLo2_ImLHbB/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CLSR9zgrXG_/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CFVKPbrlOe3/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBbxh28Fe2B/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBbw2umFycv/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B--RV4oFD88/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B--IY1Gl53J/ Wave Hill , Fort Tryon park and the Bronx Botanical Gardens are also good spots 2 other spots you might not have thought of are Governors Island and Liberty State park in NJ (This spot has great background views of the NYC skyline) Thank you howardform for your suggestions and photos! Much appreciated! I\\'ll have to save those for other NYC trips.\\nWe will be staying in the Financial District and and focusing the photography around these locations-\\nLONG ISLAND CITY/GANTRY STATE PARK\\nDOMINO PARK\\nDUMBO/BROOKLYN HEIGHTS (BROWNSTONE BLDGS) & PROMENADE/WASHINGTON ST W/MANHATTAN BRIDGE/EMPIRE STORES BLDG/BROOKLYN BRIDGE\\nSWINGS AT PIER 35\\nCENTRAL PARK (BETHESDA FOUNTAIN/TERRACE/ARCHES)\\nWe\\'ll be trying to avoid the crowds and hottest hours of the day, so timing and distance is important in planning and maximizing the most of our 4 night/3 day trip. try to add at least Governors Island, you will get some awesome shots of the lower Manhattan Skyline and the closest Land to the Statue of Liberty kribbean, I don’t know if this helps, but have you seen the engagement/wedding photos within subway stations with the name showing, or outside subway entrances? That would be an easy, cool way to have “Brooklyn” in the shot.\\n*edit*\\nSorry, that wasn’t a proper link. Just Google (if you haven’t already) subway+ engagement+nyc\\nEdited: 11:48 am, July 08, 2021 Liberty State Park was on my list to see in May when I was there, but I didn\\'t have the time. I\\'m not sure if we could squeeze it in or not, but definitely a good location.\\nI love the views of NYC from Gantry State Park and the unique wood chaise loungers and hammocks there.\\nWe\\'ve been to Governor\\'s Island before and I went again in May to check it out for this upcoming trip, but honestly it wasn\\'t a favorite due to a lot of walking in the heat with little shade. I don\\'t mind walking, but in the heat of summer it\\'s totally different. Have you considered the https://www.fdrfourfreedomspark.org/ and the Roosevelt Island tram?\\nThe ferries might be of use https://www.ferry.nyc/routes-and-schedules/ mchwippet thank you! We definitely plan on doing subway station shots, even in the subway cars. Since you\\'ll spend some time in Brooklyn Heights, how about taking a pic where you\\'ll have a street sigen of \\'Love Lane\\' in it? This is a short small alley / street in the area. We are traveling to NYC to celebrate our sons 17th birthday. We are staying the first night at the TWA Hotel with pool reservations. Then on to the Park Hyatt for four nights. Ending in Asbury Park Ocean Club for four more nights. We have book Cote for the birthday dinner. This is my sons 2nd time in NYC.\\nLast trip he fell in love with Chinatown. The shops, guys selling crazy knockoffs down the alley and some amazing authentic dim sum. I was hoping to find some recommendations for Japanese anime as well as great sneaker stores that could give us the same unique experience.\\nIn addition, other restaurants to check out. Both in NYC and Asbury Park if you know some. A lot that was on our short list haven’t reopened from Covid. He hates seafood, although we love it. Price range is completely flexible as is joints verse fine dining. We are thinking about Carnegie Deli, Red Rooster (open yet?), Llama San, and Ross & Daughter (although this isn’t close to us). Sneaker stores:\\n-Extra Butter...LES on Orchard. Nice selection. Didn\\'t have my size for a specific style when I visited 2-3 months ago.\\n-Kith...there can be a line outside, but a cool experience/selection.\\n-Adidas Originals or flagship....enough said.\\n-Nike(various locations)...same as above.\\n-Sole Stage...I stopped by here a few weeks ago. Prices are HIGH!\\n-Laced Up...picked up some Syracuse Dunks here about a month ago. There can also be a line outside.\\n-Nordstrom(57th St)...cool selection.\\n-Saks...same as above. Larger selection than Nordstrom.\\n-Stadium Goods...haven\\'t been in a while.\\n-Onitsuka...Japanese brand. I stopped by after they first opened and a few weeks ago.\\n-New Balance on 5th Ave...picked up a pair of 327\\'s a few months ago.\\n-Zumiez in Union Sq.....I picked up a great pair of Nikes on Sat.\\n-Foot Locker(various locations)...the one on 34th St across from the ESB has a decent selection.\\nJust a few off the top of my head!\\nEnjoy. I\\'m sure you\\'ll get lots of NYC advice - so I\\'ll chime in with Asbury Park Advice:\\n- MOGO Korean Fusion Tacos - super casual - great tacos\\n- Purple Glaze Donuts - crazy over-the-top donuts\\n- Robinson Ale House - for the location - right on the ocean - food is good, but not great\\n- Pop\\'s Garage - Casual Mexican on the boardwalk - my wife loves the street corn\\n- Rice - casual - great Asian/Sushi (or if you want higher end / nicer atmosphere - Taka)\\n- Moonstruck - Very nice - Italian, Seafood, Steak - good cocktails\\nAlso - Asbury Festhalle & Biergarten has a fun rooftop. I\\'m pretty sure they\\'d let your son go up if he\\'s with you - but call ahead to be sure.\\nAnd - if you\\'re willing to take a very short drive for IMHO the best pizza in NJ - check out Pete and Elda\\'s Bar / Carmen\\'s Pizzeria - wafer thin pizza - and delicious - when I\\'m really hungry - I can finish an extra large by myself.\\nAlso - definitely take a walk over to Ocean Grove - a unique oceanfront town (check out the main street, convention center, and surrounding area - perhaps grab an ice cream or a rootbeer float at the historic Days Ice Cream while you\\'re there).\\nEnjoy! Nothing to contribute, but just had to comment on Purple Glaze Donuts! Best name ever!! I would recommend Kinokuniya New York for Japanese anime.\\nEdited: 8:56 pm, July 07, 2021 The~ Carnegie Deli is gone. If you want Jewish deli food, 2nd Ave. deli or Katz\\'s are options. Russ & Daughters is only open for take out now. They,re known for their smoked fish (salmon).\\nYou\\'ve told us what food your son doesn\\'t like but not what he does. Thanks for all the current suggestions. Kith was already on the list and we did the Nike/adidas last trip but the others we all new.\\nMy son loves steak, lol. But he also eats almost all cuisines and other meats including lamb. His favorite place last time were Los Tacos #1 (he still raves about this place), Nom Wah Tea Parlor and Fuku. We were disappointed by Becco. Our previous trip choices were limited by my parents being not foodies at all. We all love a welcoming environment, creative food irregardless of nationality and low levels of pretension.\\nAnd those Asbury Park recommendations look amazing. If he likes steak, Cote is one idea, a Korean barbecue place that uses good cuts of meat. Very well regarded. Here\\'s a good list of new places to consider.\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/maps/best-new-nyc-restaurants-heatmap\\nBtw, Becco was known for it\\'s $19.95 all you can eat pasta special and convenience to theaters. May I ask why Asbury Park is on the list? If you want the Beach there are nicer beaches like Long Branch >>>… His favorite place last time were Los Tacos #1 (he still raves about this place), Nom Wah Tea Parlor and Fuku….\\nWe all love a welcoming environment, creative food irregardless of nationality and low levels of pretension.<<<\\nConsidering this criteria and what your son liked last time, I suggest :\\nCafe’ Mogador, in the East Village on St marks place. Moroccan food, it’s very welcoming unpretentious and delicious food. My favorites are the chicken tangine, the hummus and falafel. I eat there alone, love it. It gets very loud inside. Worth the wait which they’re usually is.\\nI checked and they’re doing sit down dining again.\\nAnother welcoming, Unpretentious place is Casa Adela . This is Puerto Rican food ,really good Puerto Rican food.It’s on Avenue C & E. 5th in alphabet city.\\nCoppelia is another Casual and unpretentious place with great Cuban food.\\nIt’s on W. 14th St. between seventh and eighth Avenue.\\nI hope you decide to look into these more thoroughly. Yelp has good pictures of everything and reviews & prices. Welcome to Chinatown has a nice directory with info on local businesses to support in the area: https://www.welcometochinatown.com/#directory Any thoughts on one over the other. Booked at both but leaning towards The Pearl. Thanks! The Pearl is considered a 4* hotel. Hampton Inns are 3-3.5*. There are several Hampton Inns..TS North, Central and South. Which one? Central, sorry. And thank you! That Hampton inn is In the area where there has been a big homeless problem. The Pearl location is much better anyway. Also, I think you said you have 2 teens. The Pearl has rooms with 2 queen beds whereas that Hampton inn only has 2 doubles iirc. The Pearl overall is much nicer and better for your purposes. If you read the most recent reviews of that Hampton Inn you\\'ll see mentions of the area being a problem.\\nEdited: 2:41 pm, July 08, 2021 Thank you! We will be sticking with The Pearl. Hello all,\\nI\\'m returning to NYC with my 17 year old daughter on July 9-July 14. Last time (2012) was a family trip with 3 kids so we chose Hotel Beacon in UWS for the reasonable rate on a suite.\\nI REALLY loved the look of the UWS. So clean, pretty, and picturesque. We were all over the city and I loved the area for a family trip with young kids. The room itself was just \"ok\" I\\'d like something a little prettier this time if possible.\\nNow that it\\'s just a mother/daughter trip with an older teen, I was looking at Greenwich Village which I\\'ve also heard is a really pretty area (I\\'m a libra moon so \"gritty\" is not my cup of tea).\\nWashington Square Hotel looked good location wise but read it\\'s maybe not nice enough for 2 picky ladies. Loved the Marlton and Walker Greenwich Village but those rooms only come with one bed. Expanded on my area and found the Ace Hotel in the meatpacking district but that may be too much of a party area for a teen. The search went on like this: find a hotel or an area then discount it for one reason or another. I did go to the search engines and put in our dates and budget (and entered 3 ppl to ensure 2 beds but, I\\'m starting to lose it. I HATE to be that person asking help for something searchable but I\\'ve been searching so much and it\\'s becoming overwhelming and beginning to give me anxiety. Maybe one of you lovely hotel experts will take pity on me.\\nBudget is around $350/night. Desire a location that is clean, pretty, safe, and near a subway stop. I prefer ambience and charm from a hotel but see that many of the boutique hotels only offer 1 bed per room and we would prefer 2. I know we\\'ll be all over the city for sightseeing so as long as we\\'re in a safe enough spot to get to transport, I don\\'t care so much about where it\\'s located (except that it\\'s in a pretty area). Although, if pressed, I suppose I\\'d prefer walking distance to eateries, coffee, and shops.\\nThanks in advance. Washington Square hotel is great and funky with history your daughter will love. How about East Village? Lovely area too. The Standard East Village looks nice. Check to see if it is within budget. Thank you for both of those replies. That does make me feel better about Washington Square Hotel. I will give it another look. I will also take a look at the Standard East Village.\\nI should add that I usually spend months pouring over reviews and the forum but due to coronavirus and only recently getting DD 2 weeks post 2nd vaccine, this was a last minute trip hence the anxiety. Two reasonably priced options that I would consider kind of hidden gems is The Evelyn Hotel and HGI TriBeCa. Both have great access to many walkable things including the village, SoHo, and Chelsea.\\nWhatever you decide have fun! Thank you, The Evelyn looks beautiful but they don\\'t have any 2 bed accommodations left. I know this trip is last minute so it seems we\\'ve missed out on some of the more boutique hotels that do have but have sold out of 2-bed rooms. Same goes for Washington Square Hotel. While I was debating, the 2-bed option disappeared.\\nI\\'ve seen The Giraffe is well loved on the forum and recommended by NYWhiz and they do have 2 doubles in a room as an option. Concerned that the rooms look a bit tired and I believe I read there are really no views. Don\\'t know anything about the flatiron district as I haven\\'t made it there in either of my previous trips but I think I did read it has restaurants and shopping nearby. I booked a cancellable room there just in case but I would like to keep looking.\\nI would love any continued suggestions of hotels or areas for a mom and a 17 year old daughter. Thank you! And, if you\\'ve already taken the time to answer, I truly appreciate it. Thank you!\\nEdited: 4:47 pm, June 30, 2021 I\\'ve stayed in a few neighborhoods and finally decided that UWS is my favorite. We stayed at Arthouse and really liked it. Be sure and book a room with a view because some basically face a brick wall. Great location and our room had 2 queens and a sofa bed. It was really spacious! I think if you can still get a 2 bedded room at the Giraffe, it,s likely your best option. The area is not quite as charming as the village, but still lovely with lots of good restaurants. The hotel might not be modern, but much nicer than the Beacon. The Giraffe is known for service and they have a lovely roofdeck. How about The Frederick Hotel in Tribeca? They have a deluxe double room, well within budget. (I am looking on booking.com.) I haven’t stayed there, so can’t give any first hand comments, but it is very well reviewed. Thanks mcwhippet the Frederick does look nice. I will keep that one in mind for next time. (Also, thank you for that “grateful for advice” post. I do love the NYC forum even though I haven’t been for several years. I was happy to see many current and past names mentioned that were so very helpful last time)\\nI ended up getting a double at the giraffe so we’ll just stick with that as we leave tomorrow and I’ve already begun plotting things out from there. (Also, nywhiz said so, so I felt comfortable booking there and not thinking about it too much after that)\\nAs soon as I finish my itinerary I’ll most likely post for any last minute critiques. Leaving in the morning and still have several things to do to be ready.\\nThank you all again. This forum is the best! Sounds great! Report back if you can - mom/daughter trips are my fave. Hope you have a great trip! Hello -\\nMy teen daughter and I are planning to visit the week of Thanksgiving and I am looking for some help/assistance as I narrow down our itinerary. Thank you in advance!!\\nOur must dos include: Wicked; Radio City Rockettes; Rockefeller Center, 9/11 Memorial; Ellis Island, Statue of Liberty and to visit the location of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. Other possibilities include a carriage ride through Central Park, Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade and One World Observatory.\\n1. Hotels - I think I want to stay in an area that will allow easy walking to the shows and Rockefeller Center. I know it\\'s helpful if I give an estimated budget. But honestly convenience/views/cleanliness are all more important to me. Some of the ones I have marked include: The Time, The Pearl, Hilton Garden Inn, Intercontinental, Casablanca, and Millennium. Any pros or cons to any of these? Am I missing one that may be a better choice in that area?\\n2. What is the best way to visit both Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty from the area I am looking to stay in. (We are coming from a very rural area so not familiar with using busses, subways, taxis, etc. So the easier the better).\\n3. It looks like we should plan to visit the 9/11 Memorial the same day?\\n4. Macy\\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade - it looks like we should plan to head out to this early? at like 6 am? Any other tips/tricks to get there or where to try to get a spot at?\\n5. Do we need to book a carriage ride in advance? Any better than others?\\n6. We enjoy history stuff and shows. Any other must do\\'s that would be easy to add to our list?\\nAgain - thank you for tips/advice/help you can provide!! 1) The Time has very small rooms We used to stay there. You will find most midtown hotels have smaller rooms, but if that\\'s ok with you then I would check recent reviews on the ones you have listed\\n2) Subway is easy to the ferry to the statue location. You\\'re going to need to take the subway, or expensive cabs or LONG walks (we did long walks this past weekend but we are crazy) Book SoL EARLY and only book direct, don\\'t get any of the \"City passes\" and the like\\n3) It is close to the ferry to the So. 15 minute walk or so?\\n4) Read the Top Question about the parade. Tons of info\\n5) No need to book in advance. Make sure you agree on price before you get in and understand the carriage rides are limited in where they can go in Central Park\\n6) 1000 things. Museums. Other shows. Shopping. Other Memorials. Great hikes. Etc, etc, etc The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are part of the same boat ride. The best way to get to the point of departure is to take the subway from where you are directly down to Bowling Green or South Ferry station (depending on what hotel you choose and your closest subway). Taxi will be expensive and will take forever.\\nIf you are just doing the 9/11 memorial, then it makes a lot of sense to do that after you visit the SOL and Ellis Island. If you are thinking of including the 9/11 museum, then I might split it into another day. The 9/11 museum is heavy and emotionally draining.\\nI know that you do need to get to your spot very early to see the Macy\\'s Parade. It is a real commitment. Casahoffa had some good advice about where to watch in this thread: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13449955-Where_top_view_the_Macey_parade-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nI will let others answer some of your other questions. I don\\'t think people tend to book the carriage rides in advance. I am not a fan myself -- I think a better way to experience Central Park is to walk through it. I arrive at the parade route around 8am and get a decent spot. Its not right on the street, but its close enough\\nThe trick is not to go to Herald Square and go further uptown\\nI\\'ve gone most years (Obviously not this year) so I\\'ve got it down pretty good 1. I agree the rooms at the Time are small. My favorite area within walking distance of theaters and Rock Center is the west 50’s, north of Times Square so it\\'s not quite so crazy busy. The Pearl is on west 48th st. so close to where I mean. M Social (which was the Novotel) is running intro specials and might be a good option. There are LOTS of Hilton Garden Inns. Which one did you mean? The Millenium Broadway is tired...needs updating (have you read reviews of all of these?). Look at the Courtyard Central Park too.\\n2. Subway is the best way to travel downtown. Google maps or another mapping app will give you exact directions. You can just type the names of places on\\nMaps.google.com\\nlike\\nCasablanca Hotel nyc\\nto\\nCastle Clinton nyc\\n(That\\'s where the ferries are)\\n3. The 9/11 Memorial is nearby.\\n4. The upper west side where the parade starts and Columbus Circle are good places to watch the parade. Avoid the area around Macy\\'s, where the parade ends.\\n5. Carriage rides don\\'t need booking in advance. But be warned they,re very expensive, don,t last very long and the horses are only allowed where cars are, not on walking paths. Not the best way to see Central Park.\\n6. If you\\'re history buffs, there are lots of walks, both guided and self guided on all subjects from Hamilton, the Revolutionary War, the immigrant experience...Here\\'s one list I found that has good options\\nhttps://www.wheretraveler.com/new-york-city/advice/history-lessons-5-nyc-walking-tours-time-travelers\\nWalkingoffthebigapple.com\\nFreetoursbyfoot.com\\nhave good self guided tours. Free tours also have guided options.\\nThere are also tours related to Broadway.\\nBroadwayupclose.com We watched the parade on Central Park West, just north of 70th Street and it was a great spot. My thinking was that being near the start of the parade would allow us to finish up earlier. We wanted to get there much earlier, but didn’t make it until about 7:45. Our spot was a few rows back, but we could still see most everything - the floats and marching bands were somewhat obstructed, but the balloons.are so massive, there’s no missing them at all. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum posting guidelines with prohibiting self-promotional advertising or solicitation.\\nWe ask all of our members to keep their forum messages free of self-promoting advertisements or solicitation of any kind - members affiliated with any tourism-related business should not include commercial contact information or URLs in their forum messages.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 2:46 pm, July 28, 2021 Thank you everyone! I appreciate all input/ideas/advice and will look into it all. I’m driving to NYC & am looking to park my car overnight from Sunday July 11th about 3p until Tuesday July 13th about 7am. I’m visiting friends on E 68th Street, close to Sloan Kettering. Does anyone have information on parking garages? Ive looked online & there seems to be nothing in that area. If there’s a spot, I’d it safe to park on the street?? Thank you for your advice have you used a parking app or site like Parkwhiz.com? When I put in Sloan Kettering, I see lots of garages in the area within a block or three. Parkwhiz or spothero or others will show you pricing options for any neighborhood you like. Our hotel this past weekend had a \"deal\" for $65/night across the street. We walked 7 minutes each way for $66 total, plus a $1.50 fee for Spot Hero Give Icon a try, they have garages all over the city:\\nhttps://iconparkingsystems.com/ I just searched on\\nSpothero.com\\nwith your info. The cheapest option (and good reviews) is at 200 east 69 st. For $40. Thank you!! You’re right! A lot of garages pop up! Found it!! Thank you so much!!! That’s nice. It feels good to save a little money!!! ❤️ If you prepay you\\'re guaranteed the spot and the price (I think). Without that, you may not get a space or the same price. FWIW, we\\'ve never prepaid and never not had a space, even in Pre-covid times. Some places do discounts for pay in advance.\\nWe always seem to arrive earlier than our reservation, so we like non-prepaid so we can cancel upon arrival and rebook for 30-60 minutes earlier.\\nEdited: 3:52 pm, July 08, 2021 Hi there! Family of 4, teen boys are 14 and 16. We will have 5 days in NYC staying at the Pearl Hotel in the theater district. Trying to figure out how to organize our days with the things they want to see without too much backtracking. Any guidance would be very appreciated! Here is our list:\\n911 Museum and Memorial\\nStatue of Liberty and Ellis Island\\nMuseum of Natural History\\nCentral Park\\nTop of the Rock\\nNintendo World\\nFinancial District\\nChinatown\\nEmpire State Building\\nBrooklyn Bridge\\nWax Museum\\nI realize we may not see everything but we are active people and like being on the move. Thanks again everyone! The best way is to plot them all on a map like google maps and see what\\'s near what. I\\'ll give you a start\\nFinancial District\\n9/11 Memoerial\\nFerry to SOL/Ellis Island\\nChinatown\\nBrooklyn Bridge\\nThese are likely too much to cover in one day, but could be done in a day and a half to 2 days. The SOL should be booked in advance\\nStatuecruises.com\\nThe first ferry of the day is least hectic\\nTop of the Rock\\nNintendo World\\nWax Museum\\nCentral Park\\nare all within walking distance of your hotel in midtown. ESB is too. May not be necessary to do both ESB and Top of the Rock but if you do, maybe ESB at night. Make sure to do TOTR during daylight or at sunset so you\\ncan see Central Park.\\nMuseum of Natural History is uptown and could also be combined with Central Park.\\nEdited: 12:55 pm, July 08, 2021 Just got back from NYC (traveled with husband and 18 year old son). I would also recommend the Intrepid Air and Space Museum and catching a Yankees game. I also highly recommend a tour with Real New York Tours. We did the 3-hour Little Italy/Chinatown/Financial District Tour with Trey, the first day of our trip. We learned so much about NYC! It was very enjoyable and well worth the money. It was my son\\'s favorite experience. Thanks so much, very helpful! We will do that! Reesee, we had Trey as our guide way back 10 years ago when my hubby and I just went. Amazing guide and tour! We will think about doing that again, and the other suggestions. Thanks again!! I prefer hard copy mqp. We\\'ve had queries about itinerqries thqt have had itinerqries which are literally all over the map & when we tell them that, the poster complqins that they used a computerized mqpping program. Where to have authentic Japanese food in New York City Where will you be and what type of Japanese food do you want? There is actually a Japanese district between 2nd and 3rd aves., and St. Mark\\'s Place and 9th St. with a number of restaurants. There are many other Japanese places in the city as well. In Brooklyn (a fast subway ride from Manhattan on the D or N train), there’s this place:\\nhttps://japanvillage.com/\\nJapanese food is quite popular here, there’s no shortage of places from humble snack shops to ultra high-end. St Marks is quite nice. For Sushi, I would propose some places in Midtown East (like Nare Sushi). Same for Ramen (Toto, Hide-chan, Ichiran) I love Japanese food and will definitely be in dining paradise if I ever make it to your great country. I hope you find some good authentic Japanese food in our city, but please do try our local cuisine. New York is renowned for its great food, both American and international.\\nhttps://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/American_cuisine\\nhttps://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/New_York_City#Eat If on the UES & UWS I recommend Naruto Ramen. I find it comparable to the ramen I have in Japan. It is primarily Shoyu Ramen. Meijijn Ramen on the UES is very popular. It is a Miso Ramen so not my favorite kind of ramen, but many people like the place. They have a pork katsu curry that I think I will try. I haven\\'t had Ichiran here although I have had it several times in Japan. My understanding is that Ichiran in the US isn\\'t at the same level as in japan, which is why I tend to avoid it here in favor of some of my other ramen choices.\\nTaiyaki NYC located in Chinatown has some japanese desserts, I haven\\'t gone there yet but it is on my list because I really want to try the pancakes.\\nKatagiri grocery is a good japanese grocery store with locations on east 59th street and near grand central although I am only familiar with the east 59th street location.\\nIn terms of sushi it is more of how much you are willing to spend. There are too many sushi places to mention. Some are world class with fish flown in from Japan. You will have to pay significantly for such things though. There is a lot of sub par sushi out there and I find a lot of places are hit or miss.\\nI have heard the lobster place at chelsea market has a good sushi bar. Have also heard good things about sugarfish. Both places seem relatively reasonably priced for sushi. If you are looking for a higher end sushi experience that is an entirely different conversation to have. I hope this helps.\\nhttps://taiyakinyc.com/\\nhttps://narutoramenex.com/\\nhttps://www.meijinramen.com/\\nhttp://katagiri.com/\\nhttps://www.lobsterplace.com/menu/sushi-bar/\\nhttps://sugarfishsushi.com/ Possibly taking my first trip to NYC to see a Broadway show. I do not want to drive in NYC. Any easy driving route to a spot in PA or somewhere to then take a metro into NYC. Looking for a path of least resistance as I have panic attacks in gridlock traffic.\\nFlights into NYC relatively hassle free?\\nAny advice, suggestions, helpful hints etc would be very much appreciated. I have traveled from Columbus to NYC multiple times, and flying is the only way for me. There is no guarantee that you won’t hit gridlock if you take Uber, a taxi or a bus to your hotel from the airport, although(and this is just a guess) traffic may be lighter these days. Maybe you could book a flight at an off-peak time when there is likely to be less traffic. Enjoy your first trip to NYC, but watch out - it’s addictive!\\nEdited: 12:16 pm, June 25, 2021 Question for OP: does just being *in* gridlock traffic trigger your panic attacks, or are you OK as long as you’re not the one driving? If it’s the first, that will somewhat complicate getting into the city, because traffic is really, really bad these days. You might want to focus on flights to Newark or JFK, where you would have the ability to take a train all the way. (LGA would involve a short bus ride to the train.)\\nIf it’s the second, you should be absolutely fine. Once here, you can avoid traffic jams by using the subway.\\nI agree that flying probably makes the most sense for you. I suppose you could drive to somewhere in PA and take Amtrak, but am not sure where to recommend. Anywhere within standard commuting range (e.g., the close parts of New Jersey) will have traffic almost as bad as NYC’s.\\nEdited: 1:15 pm, June 25, 2021 It\\'s hard to give advice without knowing where you\\'re starting from. For example, Amtrak has service from Harrisburg to NYC with multiple intermediate stops. You would have to find out about parking near the train stations.\\nhttps://www.amtrak.com/keystone-service-train\\nIf coming from the south, Metropark in Iselin NJ has a large parking facility and is very close to the the Garden State Parkway. Not so convenient if you were coming on I-80. Sevice to NYC on either Amtrak (more expensive and more comfortable) or NJ Transit (cheaper but not as much room for luggage.) Hamilton has similarly been recommended-farther south than Metropark.\\nAlong I-80 there are NJ Transit stations that allow long term parking and are farther out - you\\'d definitely avoid gridlock- but would involve a slower train ride. Denville is one, it\\'s about 1 1/2 hours to NYC by train.\\n(I\\'ve never used Denville but have taken the train from Metropark many times.) My apologies - I just took another look at this thread and see you\\'re starting from Columbus Ohio. Don\\'t know how I managed to miss that. Sorry!\\nPossibly the Harrisburg, Hamilton or Metropark options might work for you. I\\'m from Columbus and have driven, taken Amtrak direct from Cleveland and flown to NYC; mostly flown. Right now American has a $153 rt non stop rate (I just booked it). Amtrak is more ($254 for a roomette) and is a 12 hour ride but I\\'ve done it for the adventure and I had a travel voucher. I have driven and parked at EWR (Newark Airport) and took the train into the city. I\\'ve also driven and stayed in Newport area of Jersey City. This area has excellent views of lower Manhattan. It\\'s a relatively easy drive - about 10-12 hours depending on when you hit road construction, etc. You\\'ll have a blast. I just bought tickets for three Broadway shows :) Thank you so much for your response. It appears my friend is too apprehensive to travel to NYC for the first time so I guess I will not be going. Bummed. WOW! 3 Broadway shows! I am so jealous. I want to see Springsteen on Broadway so badly but it appears I will not be going because my friend is apprehensive to travel to NYC for the 1st time unprepared. Unless Bruce extends his run for my friend to make a trial run, I will not be going.\\nThank you so much for the great information. I will definitely use the advice of an experienced traveler. That\\'s awesome.\\nEnjoy your shows. Wish I were going with you! Thank you for for response. Gridlock causes my PAs. A friend drove from the airport on Sunday the 4th of July into NYC and there was zero traffic. Are Sundays light for traffic? Or was it the holiday?\\nI imagine COVID19 may have caused more people to work from home so less traffic?\\nThank you so much for such good information!\\nEdited: 3:00 am, July 08, 2021 Thank you so much for the great information!\\nNo worries about not catching my location, all of the info you provided is great!\\nIt looks like I won\\'t be going after all because my friend is apprehensive to travel there for the first time unprepared.\\nBummer If your friend doesn\\'t want to go - travel solo. Take the chance to see Springsteen on Broadway - it\\'s a great evening and money well spent.\\nThis is from someone who does travel solo or when traveling with friends always have some solo activities planned. Wednesday, July 7th, 2021\\nCross posting this. Expect the area to be crowded:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/486-21/mayor-de-blasio-honorees-hometown-heroes-parade Are you coming in ter? I will be at the NE corner of Exchange Place and Broadway, the one in high wedges and a pretty mask.\\nTime to celebrate. Probably not. It may rain tomorrow and def don\\'t want to get caught in that.\\n(I know you were at the US Soccer team parade...as was I. I was in that exact area, probably across the street from where you were.) Funny…probably not the only time we were 50 or 100 feet away from each other. Love our small town. We walked up that route this weekend and read all the plaques. Quite a few parades for folks who probably wouldn\\'t be celebrated now that their whole life story is known For anyone planning to go, here’s the details from NotifyNYC:\\nThe parade route is as follows:\\n- Starts southbound on Battery Place at West Thames Street and continuing east on\\nBattery Place to Broadway\\n- Turning onto Broadway and continuing northbound to Chambers Street\\n- Turning onto Chambers Street and continuing eastbound to Centre Street\\n- Turning onto Centre Street and continuing northbound to Duane Street\\n- Continuing northbound on Federal Plaza to Worth Street where the parade ends\\nSpectators are welcome to view from Battery Place to Chambers Street. ADA accessible viewing is available on Broadway between Vesey St and Barclay Street.\\nTomorrow is expected to be very hot and humid. If you are attending the parade, be sure to drink plenty of water and wear lightweight, light-colored clothing if possible.

I’m out waiting for the parade to begin. Very sparse crowd where I am. But someone is handing out bottled water - nice!\\nStrong police presence. And lots of press. Some pics from earlier today:\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos-hometown-heroes-ticker-tape-parade-honored-essential-workers It didnt seem like there was a large crowd, I didnt go just saw some pictures on TV Not in the city of course!!! Hello TA experts. I\\'m in the beginning stages of plans for a trip next summer/fall. We will fly in and out of NYC. We will spends 4 or 5 days there, and then would like to rent a car to travel to Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts. We would like to travel out of the city toward Connecticut. Any thoughts on where we could travel by train (station) and pick up a car rental. We would return to the same place and take the train back into the city prior to our flight home.\\nGreatly appreciate any help with this\\nL With all the commuter and regional rail lines heading north from NYC there are MANY options.\\nOne good option would be Stamford CT - as there\\'s a Budget and Avis Rental Car at the station - and you can travel there via Metro North from Grand Central or via Amtrak from Penn Station - and it\\'s right on I95 if your plans are taking you along the CT coast.\\nMany other options (e.g., if you are heading more north in CT - like to Hartford, you might consider White Plains NY - although the rental car pick-up there would not be as convenient)\\nThat said - if you can avoid rush hour - and you\\'re not intimidated by city driving - there are many rental car locations in NYC.\\nGood luck.\\nEdited: 10:25 pm, July 07, 2021 New Haven is another possibility; there’s a car rental office right in the station (can’t remember which company). I used it once for a trip and it was easy & convenient. It depends where in CT and MA you are going, Going to Litchfield gives a different answer than New London Way too early to plan the rental car. Prices can fluctuate a lot. If you come in the summer understand that rental prices can be extremely high. In Connecticut stamford would probably be the easiest location to rent a car. New haven is like twice the distance and you will have to pay more per ticket top get there and back. I don\\'t use the Avis in New Haven Union station as they have some extremely negative reviews with stories of people getting stuck without a car etc. I usually use Hertz in new haven which is an off-site location and they come pick me up at the station for a short ride. Whether or not they stay in business for another year is anybody\\'s guess. Another option is if your are returning to nyc on your departure day you could look at renting from the airport assuming you aren\\'t using newark airport. JFK/LGA up to CT and back isn\\'t too bad of a drive. The main drawback is that airports throw on additional fees but sometimes even with those additional fees when weighed against the cost of train tickets and sometimes higher rates at off-site locations can result in an airport rental being more economical. You really need to do the math when the trip is closer in, but if the math works out it could make sense just to drive direct to the airport and drop off the rental and fly out. Good morning and thank you for the quick replies. The plan is the Coast of Connecticut, so looks like Stamford is our best option. I will look into possibly returning to the airport as well. Not looking at renting anything now as I don\\'t have exact dates yet. But once I do.....I will put in a reservation as soon as possible. I certainly know about the rental car shortage and issues right now. We are going to the Big Island in November, and I\\'m so grateful that I reserved our car in Feb of this year. More expensive than I\\'m used to but right now the cost is more than double than my reservation. Crazy times. Hopefully by this time next year things will settle down a bit.\\nThanks again, and I\\'m certain that I will be posting more questions as our timing gets closer.\\nL Noticed I had posted on the State board, not the city one, so here goes again:\\nFirst time back in NYC since February of 2020. We never go more than 4 months without a weekend in the city, so it was all strange to us, from the packing (we forgot a few things) to the route (which shortcut to avoid traffic?) and just the general getting from place to place efficiently stuff.\\nLeft our house a bit south of Boston just after 7AM on Saturday with a full tank of gas, a half packed cooler bag (drinks and fruit) and our printed out itinerary and tickets for Little Island, The Intrepid, our parking pass, and our hotel confirmation. Hit very little traffic going down, but quickly realized we had left our iPod home so we had to listen to terrestrial radio all the way down (and back). There are parts of “Radio Free Connecticut” where that wasn’t easy!\\nNo traffic, which we find common at that hour on a holiday weekend. We usually stay at the Sheraton TriBeCa, on Canal Street, but it had been closed for Covid (reopened recently) so we booked the Marriott Downtown, on the Corner of West Street and Albany Street. We love the TriBeCa as we know all the staff and they have a great roofdeck for watching the fireworks from a bit of a distance, but still a good show. Unfortunately the staff has all departed and the roofdeck is not yet reopened (we stopped in to see if anyone was there that we knew).\\nThe Marriott was very nice. We found parking thru SpotHero on the other side of West Street for $66 for the 2 nights (every other place was at least $20 more) and dragged our bags the 7 minute walk thru the rain to the hotel. We had opted to use Marriott’s “Suite Night Upgrades” to get a better room and were given a corner room (NW corner) up on the 35th floor, and it was ready when we got there just after 10:30AM. Oddly shaped room but lots of space and three huge windows. Great unobstructed view to the west of the Hudson River, directly across from the Colgate clock (off by 10 minute), and to the North of One World Trade Center, with only a residential building between us. That residential building had AMAZING architectural features on the top 8 floors or so, with gargoyles and small balconies and all sorts of other details that couldn’t have been visible to anyone when it was built. There was also a ‘break’ in the buildings to our NorthEast where we hoped to see the 4th of July Fireworks through.\\nSet off to explore the area before a 1PM brunch at The View at Battery Park https://masterpiececaterers.com/view-at-the-battery/https://masterpiececaterers.com/view-at-the-battery/ recommended here for well priced outside brunch in lower Manhattan. We had to eat indoors due to the rain, but the food and service were excellent, as were the views, and tables were well spaced.\\nFinished up there around 3PM and made a quick pit stop at the hotel after walking along the Hudson River park to pick up some water and snacks, as we had a 5PM reservation at Little Island. Little Island is cool, but we were disappointed. Even with ticketed access it felt crowded, and unnatural. The Amphitheater there is cool, and they were setting up for a ticketed performance, but the rest of it almost felt Disney-esque (and not in a good way). There are food trucks (not real ones, but cafes) and seating to eat, and bathrooms and great views from various corners of the island, but it was too calculated for our taste. We spent about 45 minutes there then headed to dinner. Plan was to eat at The Meatball Shop in Chelsea as the menu looked good and we didn’t have a ton of time, but even though the website was active, the space was dark and looked closed for awhile. We chose to go to the Chelsea Square Restaurant in the same block, a diner we had been to before, and had huge portions of good but not memorable food there.\\nFrom there, she had 1 ticket to see Springsteen on Broadway (we saw it in the previous tour, but could only get one of the cheap (under $90) tickets, everything else was over $350), so we headed up towards Times Square. I peeled off halfway as I was meeting a friend at a bar in the 20’s and she went up to see Bruce and loved the show. I got a text as I neared the bar that my friend couldn’t get into the city, so I decided just to meander back to the hotel. 24th to the Marriott took about 75 minutes as I detoured to Union Square, the West Village, Little Italy and the Tribeca Sheraton en route to the hotel where I marveled at the views at night, including the lit up One World Tower. She got back around 11 on a nearly empty subway car (I think she took the D as it was coming first) and she walked back on deserted West Street to the hotel. She has a step counter and got 27,000 steps. She did walk from the 20s to the theater and I walked from there to the hotel, so I calculated it at 30K steps for me on Saturday\\nSunday morning we got up way too early and headed to early breakfast at George’s restaurant nearby. Excellent pancakes and eggs there, then we headed back to Little Island to meet friends who we hadn’t seen in 20+ years who moved to NYC just before the pandemic. We meandered going there and marveled at the lack of people and the ridiculous numbers of empty storefronts. Easily 50% vacancy rates in lower Manhattan (below Canal Street) and not much better in Soho and the Village. Got to Little Island (our friends had taken CitiBikes) and realized there weren’t many shady spots there to sit and catch up so we left and walked up the Riverwalk to the park near Chelsea Piers where we had a shaded table with river views where we spent a ton of time. They had to leave and we had 1:30PM tickets to see the Intrepid, so we wandered thru Chelsea and towards Times Square to have a quick lunch at Wasabi, and then over to the ship at 45th Street. On the way we stopped in to Gotham West Market for:\\n1) Air Conditioning\\n2) Bathrooms\\n3) AMAZING Ice Cream at “Mikey Likes It”\\nGot to the Intrepid a little early which was no problem. We didn’t wait in the 45 minute line for the Growler submarine or do any of the extra charge options (motion rides, etc) but still spent nearly 2 hours exploring the ship and the Space Shuttle exhibit. The Concorde is closed for visiting although you can walk along underneath it. First time at the Intrepid for us and we both liked it more than we expected to\\nFrom there we had 6PM plans with friends at their apartment on the (lower) Upper East Side (60th near 2nd), so back on our feet up through Times Square (TKTS is closed, steps are open, lots of “characters” looking for tourists to take pics with), lots of empty store fronts even there. We had a quick walk through there and headed to Central Park to people watch and sit in some shade for awhile. Watched the horse drawn carriages and bikers and walkers for a bit, then headed into Whole Foods to pick up something to bring for dessert. Saw the HUGE lines and turned right around and left. We got to our friends’ place early, as expected, and wandered the neighborhood until we got to Sprinkles which took care of dessert! A nice meal later we headed to the subway as we wanted to be back in our room by dark to see if we could see the Macy’s Fireworks or other shows in the distance in New Jersey. But first a stop had to be made to get a T Shirt at Wo Hop, our favorite place in Chinatown (she’s been going there since High School) so we got off the subway on Canal Street, got the shirt (wearing it now) and then walked back to the hotel. Got there as the sun was setting (beautiful view) and just over 36,000 steps (that’s 15 miles, plus 12 on Saturday) and there were fireworks on the horizon from every angle in New Jersey. And a strange barge just hovering in the river between us and New Jersey. At 9:30 or so I noticed the reflection of a large firework off of nearby building, we DID have a small view of the NYC Fireworks. And then, 1 minute later, the show for New Jersey, in the Hudson started, from the barge right outside our window. We could not have been better located for the display! 30+ minutes or so of bangs and booms and colors and sizzles. Incredible.\\nMonday morning we woke up a bit later and packed, and walked to Fulton Street and the East River, stopping at the “Stage Door Deli” for a pedestrian breakfast, then got the car and headed back home.\\nSO good to be back in NYC. Saw very few homeless people. Saw no crime and never felt unsafe. Saw TOO many vacant stores and restaurants (it seems only the fast food joints and banks were unscathed). Was great to catch up with friends and with The City but she isn’t quite herself again yet. We’ll be back over Labor Day, staying uptown, IIRC, and we’ll see how things are then. Where is \"Radio Free Conneticut\"?\\nI just went to Vermont for the weekend and Drove through Hartford the radio worked fine, I think I had the same station from New Haven area all the way past Springfield, MA , Thats the best way to get to Boston is thorugh Mass Pike and I-84 (As opposed to I-95 which is a giant Parking Lot) Thanks for sharing your visit. Will you now decamp to the Marriott rather than the Sheraton? Thanks for your trip report! We were in the city the weekend before for the first time since January 2020, it did feel weird being back in a place we were in so frequently in the past. We also checked out Little Island and felt similarly - we are glad we saw it, but no real reason to go back. Same way we felt about Hudson Yards and the Vessel. Thanks so much for the trip report, NT. I love reading these again. Very interested in your views on Little Island. I dislike “calculated” so much, so I’m grateful to hear that (and about the Vessel, jtwiz).\\nI admire your walking “feats” (see what I did there? 😉) so much. I don’t think I can ever hope to replicate it, but it’s inspiring! So happy to read your trip report. Very refreshing to see some of these again. Sounds like it was a fun trip, NT -- glad you made it back to NYC at last! :) Good question about our future stays. We *really* like the TriBeCa location, this Marriott wasn\\'t as close to the subway as we like, and the area was a bit too quiet for our tastes. We have a few alternatives lined up for Labor Day and the winter holidays and we\\'ll see what happens. May end up back in TriBeCa anyway.\\nRadio Free Connecticut was from just south of Hartford to near Bridgeport or so. Hartford has lousy stations.\\nNever done The Vessel or any of the Observatories. We do like the High Line, but we were familiar with it before it was prettified and had followed the transformation as it was happening. If you like the High Line, your next trip should be the High Bridge. You might have passed it on the Major Deegan near Yankee Stadium.\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/COGzR7FrEtr/\\nthat area has some interesting things anyway, It has the Morris Jumeal Mansion , Sylvan la and the John T Brush Staircase\\nAlso Hamilton Grange is nearby\\nEdited: 11:20 am, July 07, 2021 We did pass the High Bridge as we were heading home. Took FDR drive instead of West Side Highway and didn\\'t much like the enclosed spaces and narrower lanes. But the High Bridge is on our list, maybe for Labor Day when B\\'way is still mostly closed It doesnt have the plants the High Line has and its a lot noiser (The East River Drive , The Major Degan go right under it) and I-95 is really close by. But it certainly is worth the visit. There is an interesting Water tower on the Manhattan side as well I know the Lexington recently reopened, but I cannot find even one current review. Have you stayed there or heard any reviews? Planning a trip 9/10-9/13. Looking for a Marriott property. If it has reopened then it has reopened very very recently, as it appeared closed as recently as a couple weeks ago, so am guessing nobody inclined to write reviews has stayed there yet. The Lexington isn’t showing any availability until August 1st. I don’t think they have reopened yet. Yes, I just checked the Marriott website and got same response -- nothing until Aug 1. I happened to go by it on a bus this afternoon and it sure didn\\'t look open, though I didn\\'t knock on the door or anything. The Starbucks in it, on Lexington Ave side, still seems boarded up, though that may be permanent, as they have permanently closed a couple other locations in the area.\\nEdited: 11:37 pm, July 05, 2021 The Residence Inn Times Square which is actually across from Bryant Park on 6 th Ave. has a great price for your dates ($215/night). You get a kitchen and included breakfast. There is also a Residence Inn right near the Lexington, on e 48 between Lex and Third. I believe it stayed open throughout the lockdown, so should have plenty of reviews. There is a Courtyard a couple blocks away on Third in low 50s. I don\\'t know if it was open throughout lockdown, but has been open a long time, probably at least since last summer or fall, so it also should have reviews. Note website for Residence Inn on E 48 says they have suspended hot breakfast during pandemic. Whether that info is still true, I don\\'t know. Whether it means they offer cold alternative, I also don\\'t know. If breakfast is important to you, you might want to call. The poster who said it isn\\'t available until August 1st is correct. July 31st says sold out. If you look more carefully you\\'ll see no rooms available for whole of July, which to me means hotel not open yet. Thanks NYWhiz!! it\\'s been a while but you always come through!!! we aren\\'t coming until 9/10, so maybe I\\'ll book something else that can be cancelled if the Lexington does indeed open and look good! Wider doors, more space for standing and moving around, but some seats look narrower front to back:\\nhttps://www.railwayage.com/passenger/rapid-transit/first-look-nyct-unveils-r211s/?utm_source=&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=26657 I can do without the yellow railings that will likely chip, unlike the present stainless steel. The seats seem to retain the almost flat surface as in the display model and these will be a pain in the you know what. Just got home from the Parade of Heroes. After the float w the ancient Brooklyn Rapid Transit subway car, they had a brand-spanking-new electric clean energy bus. That’s exciting! Also a super cool looking mirrored sanitation truck. I would rather see a sanitation truck with a big nose above the cab. I am bringing both of my daughters to New York for the first time. My eldest has always wanted to come to New York with hopes of seeing Mariska. She has been a Law and Order SVU fan forever. Do you happen to know if they are filming in the city in September? I would love to surprise her with that especially with us being there for her Birthday. Check this web site:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/mome/industries/tv-film.page Here are NBC\\'s and a tour company\\'s websites specifically for Law & Order SVU locations:\\nhttps://www.nbc.com/law-and-order-special-victims-unit/photos/season-16/visit-the-svu-set\\nhttps://onlocationtours.com/locations/law-order-series/ This site also has daily updates on what is filming:\\nhttps://onlocationvacations.com/2021/07/05/tuesday-july-6-filming-locations/ Any help would be good thanks There is no direct easy way.\\nFrom the website: http://www.cruiseliberty.com/passenger_info.html#parking\\nIf you want to do this by public transportation, you need to take subway (or walk) to 33rd street PATH station take the Path train from there to one of the places where you can change to the Light Rail (and that may involve a path train change depending on whether you are going week or weekend and where you pick up the light rail, Hoboken, Newport or Exchange Place). Then the light rail to Bayonne. Then call a cab to take you to the port. Details on the linked website. (Also check out what hour cruise company offers)\\nPersonally, I would take a cab from manhattan to bayonne or Uber. But it will cost over $100, depending on time of day.\\nEdited: 3:15 pm, July 05, 2021 Taking the PATH to NJ, then taking a car service the rest of the way would significantly cut costs compared to taking a car from Manhattan. Kind of a compromise.\\nEdited: 3:26 pm, July 05, 2021 Yeah. In that case, I would take the path to grove st, and then a cab. The last time in did that (over a year ago), it was $25 for a cab to Bayonne from grove st. It’s probably the best move. It shocks me that the cruise companies have not done more to get people from manhattan to the Port.\\nThere are usually a line of local cabs waiting across the street from the path station. Could we take bus to Bayonne then taxi to port Yes, you can take a bus from Port Authority...It used to be the 99S but I think it\\'s now the 119. When you get to Port Authority, ask at the information booth to be sure - they run pretty regularly so if you miss one, you can catch the next one. Takes about an hour+, and it\\'s - for lack of a better word - a very schleppy ride. You will want to call a cab from your drop off point on JFK Blvd to the Port. I dont know when this trip is planned, but be aware there arent any cruises at this time, we do not known when cruises will return On July 1, the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, including the outdoor observation deck at the top was reopened. The crown remains closed at this time, but this is still some good news and I was right about the pedestal reopening before the crown. Still wondering when the crown will reopen and what will have to happen before the crown reopens? https://www.nps.gov/stli/learn/news/statue-of-liberty-pedestal-observation-deck-to-reopen-july-1.htm#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20The%20National%20Park%20Service%20will,will%20be%20kept%20at%2050%25. Why in the hell is the crown closed? I would think it is because that area is a small space where social distancing is virtually impossible. Hello! I have finally talked my husband into doing a family trip. This will be my 5th trip, but 1st family trip. I have done girls weekends and preferred staying downtown over midtown. My boys are 13 and 10, I figured they would enjoy the vibe and cheesiness that comes with midtown. I have always wanted to stay at Washington square hotel in the past and love Greenwich village, but they were always booked, it does look like they have rooms available for our trip. I\\'m torn on where to stay now. It looks like some things are still not open in midtown and we will be using the subway to get around. Which would you recommend for a family of 4 who will be doing the usual touristy stuff? Thanks! Greenwich Village would be my pick. The Village is more quiet than Midtown that many appreciate. You would have to walk several blocks eastward to Broadway or Lafayette for the subway, or westward to 6th or 7th ave. Recently, there have been some problems in Washington Square Park at night and a closing time was imposed that met with considerable opposition. I have not encountered recent news on this subject and things may have quieted down. Both would work, and whichever you picked, the other is an easy subway ride away. It seems there has in fact been mention of Washington Square Park problems recently.\\nhttps://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/07/05/arrests-made-in-washington-square-park-amid-clashes-with-nypd-officers-on-fourth-of-july Thank you all! I think I’ll stick with the original plan of staying in midtown. Maybe I can talk my husband into a return trip, just the 2 of us to stay in Greenwich village! We walked thru Washington Square park and past the hotel on the 4th around 830AM. Very few people there compared to usual, there were cops at the two entrances we used (north and west) and barricades around the Arch Keep in mind there have also been problems around Times Square, and a homeless problem near Port Authority and along 8th Ave. between 34-42 st. Which hotel or area of midtown were you thinking about? The best deal I’ve found was at the Westin, on the corner of 43rd and 8th. I’ve never felt unsafe in previous trips. Maybe we should hold off until things start to pick up. We were planning October. That,s right near Port Authority and may be why that,s the best deal you found. Others have posted on the forum that things should improve soon and may be fine by Oct., but I would book something in a different location further east. I wouldn\\'t postpone the trip, just pick a better location to stay. I wouldn\\'t rush off to change hotels if you were fine with the area pre-pandemic. As with everything else things can change rapidly. The homeless people in all the hotels are supposed to be moved out by end of July. Broadway will be opened up by the time you come in October. I would imagine those two factors will go a long way towards having that area return to more what it was like pre-pandemic. rooms seem tiny, but the suites/rooms with balconies look large. hows the location? I’ve walked by a few times lately. It’s a fun location. I’ve stopped and peered in…looks cool. We stayed at 11 Howard on our last trip which is just around the corner from NoMo Soho. We loved the location. Lively with lots of good shops close by. Subway close by, but also easy walking to so many spots. I’d highly recommend the area for a stay. we usually utilize the subway and have no issues. however, i am concerned regarding \"medical safety\". is there mask wearing? or is everyone on the honor system with masking if not fully vaccinated. Most people - not all - wear masks on the subway, as far as I’ve seen. My experience at this point is about 10% of the people on subways refuse to wear a mask. It used to be close to 100% mask use but now some are refusing to do so. I notice 2-3 maskless people everytime I go into a train car now. You didn\\'t ask this question, but mask wearing seems pretty consistent on buses. A week or two ago I told a guy who had his down while he yelled on his phone that he should put it on and he did.\\nThe other day a guy got on who didn\\'t have one and was fiddling in his bags -- wasn\\'t sure if he was looking for a mask or his money, In any event, I didn\\'t feel comfortable around him so I moved to the back of the bus. But otherwise people seem to wear them. Crowded 6 train was about 80% masked on Sunday night I continue to notice high levels of mask-wearing on trains…I’d say upwards of 90%. Slightly less but still high on buses.\\nIt’s not the honor system for fully vaccinated folks - masks are still legally required on transit for everyone. I called out a group of out of towers not wearing masks and 1 said \"I\\'m vaccinated\". I said so am I but the rules on mass transit are we all wear masks so please put yours on! Definitely has gone down. 80-90% masked and a few maskless per car seems the norm. Percentage of maskless goes up later at night too.\\nEdited: 9:34 am, July 07, 2021 https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/nathans-hot-dog-eating-contest-2021-results-joey-chestnut-sets-new-world-record-wins-14th-title/\\nJoey Chestnut wins again for the 14th time, eating 76 dogs and buns in 10 minutes, breaking his own record from last year.\\nMichelle Lesco won the women\\'s round, eating 30 3/4 dogs and buns in 10 minutes.\\nI don\\'t know how they do it. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 2:14 pm, July 09, 2021 Ive been to that contest many times, its kinda of a cool thing to go to. Obviously I didnt go last year, and I didnt go this year either as I went out of town to Vermont Cool event. I\\'ve only been to 1 and it was the last time Chestnut didn\\'t win. 2006 I believe and that Japanese guy won like his 7th straight but last time.\\nI registered 4 myself over a much longer time than those guys and that was definitely my max. I\\'ve only seen the highlights on local TV news but have to say watching Joe Chestnut\\'s \"technique\" is one of the grossest things I\\'ve ever seen. Totally repulsive.\\nActually, watching anyone\\'s technique at that is repulsive. Do they all go throw up after it\\'s over?\\nEdited: 2:56 pm, July 05, 2021 And for any folks from Alberta, CA, you might like to know that it is the same Joey Chestnut that holds the record for the Calgary fish taco eating contest: now at 23 tacos in 5 minutes. Evidently, Mr. Chestnut resides in Indiana and eats his way to glory.\\nCH I just watched the 30 for 30 yesterday on the previous competitions when he had to learn how to beat Takeru Kobayashi and once he did he kept beating him. One hot dog gives me indigestion for the rest of the day. I think I would die from eating so many. They must just slip down. Yuck.\\nFish tacos would be hard to eat too. But they could be easier than hot dogs if he can finish 23 in 5 minutes. That equates to 46 in 10 minutes, less than his dog eating record. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

I was in the city for Liberty Weekend in 1986. It was pretty awesome. I was able to go watch the fireworks from a rooftop in the LES. Wasn\\'t something I had planned on doing, but I got a call last minute so was able to slip down there and avoid all the crowds and have a prime viewing spot. The number of illegal and high power fireworks going off in the neighborhood was insane. With all the constant explosions it felt like a war zone. People had access to those large fireworks. It was also crazy the number of boats with spectators that were out on the east river. As soon as the show is over they all have to sail south and it was like a 100+ boats heading south down the east river at the same time. Was quite the spectacle. All in all it was a great show. I wouldn\\'t go stand in a crowd for hours to see it, but I\\'m glad I headed down to see it. Thanks for sharing\\nEdited: 1:50 pm, July 06, 2021 Yep always has been. New Years Day it has competition though. I’m looking at booking a surf lesson for my 3 grands, ages 8,9 and 11. I’ve seen a variety of options, but wondered if anyone here has specific knowledge/experience with a particular business. Any advice? We will be in Brooklyn for a couple of weeks, so we are flexible on the day. Will you have a car? My cousin\\'s daughter took lessons in Long Beach and loved them. They drove from Manhattan, but you can get there by Long Island railroad and the train does stop in Brooklyn at Atlantic Avenue. I\\'ll find out the name of the school she uses.\\nI\\'m sure there are also lessons at Rockaway beach in Queens but I have no personal knowledge about what\\'s there. You can definitely take lessons in Rockaway, but I don’t have any first (or even second) -hand experience. It,s this co. Company which has locations in both Rockaway and Long Beach.\\nhttps://skudinsurf.com/register-kids-camps/ Planning on coming to NYC in February for my wife\\'s birthday. All the plans were in place except I found out Hugh Jackman, who is my wife\\'s fav, is starring in The Music Man while we are there so I was pretty much obligated to get tickets for Wednesday matinee, which starts at 2. Our flight home is at 8 p.m. that night.\\nConsidering the show will likely end around 4:30-ish, we\\'ll need to get back to our hotel to get our luggage, so to say we get picked up at 5 by taxi/ride share at Casablanca Hotel off of 42nd St., will we have time in what I assume is rush hour traffic to make it to LaGuardia by 7 to catch a flight, or would that be really pushing it? Other option is stay one more night and take an early morning flight. Getting picked up by 5 with the hope of getting to LGA by 7? Yes, that shouldn\\'t be a problem unless something extraordinary happens. I suspect you\\'ll get there around 6-6:20. We are moving our kiddo to Manhattan for college in August. We would like to spend one full day/two nights in the area. We will probably have some sort of hitch attachment so I’m thinking it might be better to stay outside of the city for purposes of parking easily. I figure we can take the train in to explore on the one full day and then drive in on the second day for the actual move in to the dorm. Any thoughts as to where I should target to stay that has walking distance access to trains? For safety purposes I plan on storing anything on the trailer in the SUV overnight. I would plan to empty the trailer/SUV on Day 1 and not park it full.

Our university is not urban and forbids trailers and such; I can imagine it\\'s even more strict in NYC. I have seen kids moving into NYU, it all seemed highly organized, with cars waiting down the street until their designated time to move up to the building entrance, and I don\\'t recall seeing any trailers. Arriving LGA Friday around 7:30pm - read the NYT recent article and am wondering if there are any recent reports of Taxi wait times and/or Uber pricing from LGA. I have checked the LGA website for taxi wait times - it always says \"no wait\" or \"1 minute\" which seems suspicious to me, LOL. Thanks for any recent reports/information. Can\\'t wait to get back to NYC!! My only personal experience was Memorial Day weekend, arriving 11:30pm and the wait time was about an hour for a Cab and no ubers available. 7:30 should be a much better time to arrive. My girlfriend took a Lyft from Laguardia 2 Mondays ago at 11PM and there was very little wait. it seems like right now, with the car shortage, Ubers and Lyfts are ON AVERAGE about 25-50% more expensive than yellow cabs, but that they are often more available. I have no airport uber experience, but....the few times i used an uber 2 weeks ago from the times square area, it arrived within 5 minutes of my request. At LGA you must meet car services at the designated area (curbside pick up not allowed)\\nhttps://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides Thanks guys so much, this really helps! Much appreciated! Belated update - arriving around 7:30pm at LGA on a Thursday, we had a 12 minute wait for an Uber which cost $51. We had no difficulty around Manhattan getting Uber or Lyft at reasonable prices and the one returning to the airport was $57. Thanks again everyone for the info! Thanks for reporting back. It helps for people to have current ideas of what the prices are since when it comes to questions like this what people paid several weeks ago are not really going to be indicative of what people pay going forward due to how rapidly conditions can change. Hi Does anyone know a good currency exchange in NYC where I can get Croatian Kuna.\\nThanks\\nCW There used to be a great currency exchange in the Pan Am building, when the airline was still in business, and that is where I once went to exchange some Yugoslavian dinar my parents had been unable to exchange where they lived. I don\\'t know where or if that business currently exists, but there are several currency exchange places in the Grand Central vicinity and suggest you check those out, calling if necessary. The one I usually go to is on E 42d across from Grand Hyatt hotel. A&S Foreign Exchange gets good reviews. 7th Ave & 30 St.\\nThere\\'s a phone number on their website; you could call to ask if they have what you need.\\nhttp://asforeignexchange.com/ I googled and found International Currency Exchange will order a less popular currency like that if you contact them in advance. They can also send it to you at home. They have multiple locations but they all get different Yelp reviews. This location, inside an Apple bank gets good reviews\\nhttps://www.ceifx.com/locations/ny-nyc/upper-east-side\\nbut the A & S place also gets good reviews. I\\'d call both. Hi - I am planning a family trip to NYC at the end of July, staying in the midtown area near Times Square (Casablanca hotel). Will have 2 teens with us. I was really excited about the trip as my kids have never been, but many people are telling us to cancel and go elsewhere due to the high levels of crime in the area. I saw that there was another Times Square shooting this week which is really scary and it sounds like the subways are also unsafe which was our main plan for transportation on a budget. I am really torn as I already booked a lot of activities including the 9/11 Memorial, Statue of Liberty and MoMA. Are there any locals who have some advice? Should we wait and try another year when things are more normal? Thanks. Subways are safe\\nTimes Square is safe. NYPD is increasing patrols there big time.\\nWe are going this weekend, and we will be on the subway, in the theater district and everywhere else between there and the southern tip of the island\\nEdited: 8:50 pm, June 29, 2021 This local walks around everywhere (although I don’t spend a lot of time in Times Square - yuck). Just got home from a gallery opening night reception in Soho for a photographer I follow. Streets are alive and life in the city feels great.\\nI’m not concerned about taking a subway, just enjoying walking around as much as possible.\\nMaybe consider staying in another area (but I would have said that two years ago too). “ but many people are telling us to cancel and go elsewhere due to the high levels of crime in the area.”\\nAre these people residents of the city? Or recent visitors who had safety issues? Or…? https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13585436-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThere have been reports of \"skyrocketing\" crime in Pittsburgh. What is your perspective on that? \" but many people are telling us to cancel and go elsewhere due to the high levels of crime in the area.\" A quick internet search tells me that Pittsburgh has seen a 55% increase in homicides compared to last year from January to June. I\\'m going to tell everyone I know not to go there otherwise they will be murdered. Sound reasonable? Somehow I doubt any of the people giving you that information are from NYC. I\\'m wondering where you would go if you do cancel?\\nI don\\'t live in the city but will be making a solo visit next weekend. The only thing I plan to do different than normal is I don\\'t plan to take the subway after 10-11 pm. I\\'ll wait a few more months for that, until Broadway shows are up and running again. Thanks everyone for the advice and perspective. Mainly it has been family who are worried and sending me articles about tourists being shot or people being attached on the subway. This is very helpful. I am going to continue planning for NYC. We are also going to Cape May on a leg of this trip so other option is to just stay at the beach. We tend to like some variety in travel though so NYC it is! Just make sure everyone in your group is fully vaccinated against COVID, as reported cases of the new Delta variant are said to be spreading rapidly, especially among the young and the unvaccinated. There are people from all over visiting NYC, and there is no way to tell who may be infected or who is or is not vaccinated. I do live in the city/am a local. I take the subway daily. I can bet that each and ever person who told you to cancel had not set foot in nYc...during the recent times, if ever.\\nI rode the subway this past Sat & Sunday(and all last week.) I saw young teens alone riding the subway. I saw moms with strollers riding the subway. I saw older men/women riding the subway.\\nThen there was me riding the subway sorta dozing off before I got to my stop. Neve gave it a 2nd thought.\\nNYC has approximately 8.5 million people. Things happen. You will most likely never experience anything that you consider \"crime\".\\nGeez! I agree with being fully vaccinated before you come to NY. You will not be able to socially distance in NYC full time because there are just too many people and the new variant (it made up 23% of the new covid cases last week) going around is extremely contagious. Also, if you are in tourist areas you will be exposed to people from all over the country and from other parts of the world, so even if the vaccination rates are high in NY that isn\\'t necessarily going to be representative of vaccination levels of the crowds around you if visiting tourist attractions. Hi everyone, I’m coming in on Wednesday for a week and see that rain and thunderstorms are predicted. Is it still pretty hot and humid? I was originally planning on bringing just summer dresses but am wondering if long pants would be better for evenings. Just trying to make sure I’m bringing weather related appropriate clothes. Thanks so much for any advice you can give me. If its leading up to a storm it can get very hot and humid. After a storm it can be much cooler and less humid. In terms of the temperatures and what you should bring all you can do is look at the weather report like everyone else does. Nobody is going to have different information. Thanks, Red259. It probably seems like a silly question to you and I understand. I think I was just hoping for someone to tell me, yes, you will probably need long pants according to next week’s forecast or no, it’s been too hot and humid, so stick to packing summer dresses. I appreciate your input. You can be sure it\\'s not going to be cool. Both Tues and Weds highs in mid 90s. Mid 80s starting Thurs, with nighttime lows in mid 70s, though with humidity ranging from 75- 90% it will be sticky (and very uncomfortable for those of us who don\\'t do well in high humidity). I doubt you\\'ll \"need\" jeans or pants but may want them (or not). But bring a sweater or denim jacket for A/C. Thanks, RisaL, appreciate your help! Thanks, Grandrue, I’m thinking I really don’t need to bring any pants! Appreciate your advice. Hot and humid today, and even more so tomorrow and for the days to come. We anticipate nothing but shorts and light cotton shirts.\\nCH Thanks, CasaHoffa, my long pants are staying in California! The only long pants I would bring are ones that are light cotton & wide legged for when you are going to spend time in a place like where the a/c might be cranking. However, these kinds of questions are dependent on how hot/cold tolerant you are. I am sensitive to cold & I have left a restaurant where the outside was hot & humid but by the time I left the restaurant, I was shivering. Thanks, blumebdwaybaby, I get what you mean about different people’s tolerance for hot and cold weather. Your insight is much appreciated. Looking for arrival night dinner. Anticipate arrival at hotel around 730. Crosby Street.\\nIs there a location close that i could plan for dinner that wouldn\\'t necessarily require reservations, in case flight delayed? When is this?\\nI looked on opentable to see where there are tables tomorrow night, to see what’s got close-to-last-minute availability.\\nBlue Ribbon\\nThe Dutch\\nBistro Les Amis\\nAurora\\nLupa\\nMarket Table\\nBistro Leo\\nIl Mulino Prime\\nAnd more….\\nThat’s what I would do, on the day before, see what’s available still. How about Balthazar? It\\'s on Spring and Crosby Not so easy to get a last minute table at 7:30-8pm….long wait, if st all. And not on open table so not as easy to check. (Resy will just say “notify me”). I figured that’s an exercise in frustration, that’s why I didn’t mention it. Help! I got tickets to watch the Yankees tonight at 7p. Will I have time to watch the fireworks? Game will only be 7 innings due to dbl header. Where is the closest place I can go to watch after the game? Thank you! Doubtful\\nThe event starts at 8 pm\\nYou\\'d need to take the subway https://new.mta.info/map/5256 down to midtown and walk over to the East River which will likely be very crowded before you could get there\\nhttps://www.macys.com/social/fireworks/where-to-watch/?section=faqs&lid=fireworks_unitedwecelebrate-faqs Lots of other shows to watch in the Bronx or in New Jersey I have to say that what I could see out my kitchen window last night to the northeast of Flushing gave me almost as much enjoyment as going to the Macy\\'s event in the past. I simply pulled up a chair and watched it for an hour and some. I was astonished at some of the displays that seemed very elaborate and professional. I am not exactly certain where these originated and tried to count the seconds between the flash and the sound to estimate the distance, perhaps 2 miles. In some ways, Macy\\'s is too much of a good thing with many shells being fired at the same time. It is difficult to appreciate the individual effects with so much going on. It is analogous to mixing up all the food on your plate instead of enjoying the different portions. Coming BACK to NYC for the upcoming holiday weekend. Meeting friends for brunch anywhere below the WTC area, so FiDi or Battery Park City.\\nNeeds to be outside, and hopefully tables for five available. Not fancy. Hoping for $20-$25/person plus drinks, tax, tips. Lunch menu works too. Looking for salads, burgers, eggs, any combo of basics as we have a couple vegetarians involved.\\nThanks! Can’t wait to return! I *think* Liberty Bistro in Battery Park City has outdoor seating, but I hope someone corrects me if I\\'m wrong. Playing by memory here, since I haven\\'t been in town since before the pandemic obviously.\\nhttps://libertybistro.nyc/brunch-menu\\nBut perhaps a bit too upscale for what you\\'re looking for?\\nEdited: 7:59 am, June 18, 2021 That looks quite reasonable for our needs if they have outside and tables for 5. Thanks for the suggestion!\\nI also found Industry Kitchen, but they won\\'t let me reserve a table for 5 online, only for 4. I can call them, but I\\'d like to see more options before we commit. In the same \"square\" PJ Clarke\\'s outside is fun. Not strictly brunchy, but fun. The View at Battery Park (near the Staten Island Ferry) has brunch in the $15-20 range looking out at the Statue of Liberty. https://masterpiececaterers.com/view-at-the-battery/ I have BOOKED The View, Risa! Looks perfect for our needs!\\nI was thinking o PJ Clarkes, TPXB, would have been good, too\\nThanks! Restaurant was great! Rain forced us inside, the place was very quiet. Food was good, service was attentive, prices were reasonable. Outside looked terrific, but was not to be. Glad it worked out, despite the rain. Glad the spot worked out so well for your group! - The Met\\n- The American Museum of Natural History\\n- One World Observatory\\nWe will be in NYC 24-27 July. I have a general itinerary but would like to maintain some flexibility for weather as we get closer to our travel dates. Do I definitely need reserved tickets for these sites, and if so, how long dare I wait to make the reservations? As always, thanks in advance! With those three sights the only one that could be weather affected is the OWO so I would wait to book that one a few days out. Check the forecast then buy for a clear day. It\\'s open until 9.00pm so if the weather looks bad for the day, the night time could be OK.\\nYes, they all require reserved tickets for a timed entry.\\nIf you have questions about refunds in case of bad weather contact the sight or check their website FAQS.

It was formed as a cooperative venture of Greyhound and Peter Pan in 1978. Service was suspended during the pandemic, but it was recently announced the buses will not be put back into service. Thanks for the info. Too bad. Sometimes there were great deals to be had. Megabus, BoltBus\\'s chief competitor, is still operating, though with a reduced number of trips on its routes. The two discount bus companies operated many identical routes. Megabus is a division of the company that also operates Coach buses, This is good news!\\nAs from June 25th 2021, the NYS Travel Advisory is no longer in effect and traveller health forms are no longer required for those arriving in New York State.\\nThe CDC Guidance is now fully in effect for all domestic and international travel to the USA, including returning US citizens.\\nThe good news is that this means there is a loosening of who is considered \"fully vaccinated\".

They only modify quarantine requirements, based on the traveller\\'s vaccination status. Covid cases and hospitalizations are rising in a couple of states in the US. Specifically those with low vaccination rates. Nevada has seen the nation’s biggest spike in covid cases over the past two weeks — up 114%. Which is a problem when you think about all the tourists going to Vegas and then heading home afterwards to all parts of the country. Unfortunately I think the fall is going to be rough for the US given the way cases are being seeded over the summer. \"No One Is Safe Until We ALL Are Safe!\\n😷 #gettheshot \\U0001fa84\"\\nI fully agree, JNSgraphic.

More people are flying now than they were in 2019, so the variant is going to be everywhere in the country. The US had a chance to avoid this, but some people couldn\\'t be bothered to do the right thing.\\nEdited: 6:49 pm, July 03, 2021 Unless I have missed some very big news, the info in this post relates primarily to Americans.

See, for example, info currently posted on website of US Embassy London.\\nhttps://uk.usembassy.gov/visas/u-s-visa-and-travel-faqs/ What recommendations for a hotel would you have that might meet our desires:\\nNear a subway stop;\\nin a safe, quieter area with lots of good restaurant choices,\\nLess than $275 per night for 2 adults end of July, beginning of August\\nClean, modern, updated facility with good mattresses and good WiFi\\nWalking distance to a few attractions\\nPleasant staff\\nBreakfast included would be a nice bonus but not a dealbreaker\\nThank you for your help! The \"quieter\" part is tricky in my opinion, in a city where there\\'s various kinds of noice from the street life. Anyhow, I would look into areas like East Village, Tribeca, Soho, Union Square and similiar mostly because they do fit the bill of being near a bunch of subway lines and lots and lots of good restaurants and in general \\'nice\\' areas to hang out in.\\nLook into The Standard East Village to see if it fits your bill? From the description it might. Don\\'t know if it\\'s within budget.\\nI\\'m quite partial to Tribeca since it does have a quieter vibe in general (but there are the typical big city street life / noice as you can find in other areas too) but I\\'m not sure the hotels that would be within your budget fits what you\\'re describing. The Frederick is an older building, but was refurbished in 2015. Otherwise a great location - a subway station outside the door practically and a bunch of others within a short walk. The downtown sights within easy walking distance (Brooklyn Bridge, all the main sights in Financial District including the ferries to Statue of Liberty). Thank you for your thoughtful reply. I will definitely check out all you recommended. MaxiSweden, if we took “quieter” out of the equation, would that bring to mind any real standout hotels in your mind? I like the location of the Hyatt Union Square. I think the rooms are small-ish but so are many hotel rooms in New York City.\\nWashington Square Hotel is in a great location - but I have to say I like the look of the Standard East Village better - it seems to be more modern looking (I think they\\'re within a 15 - 20 min walk of one another). Sixty Soho could perhaps be an option too. From your other thread it sounds like you\\'d prefer 2 beds which is always more expensive and can be hard to find. You may have to search for 3 people. Also know taxes (~15%) and sometimes resort fees add to the price you¡ll see on a search engine. So some initial thoughts for now.\\nThe Residence Inn Central Park is not necessarily in a quiet location but the building is quite tall and relatively new, so you won\\'t hear street noise. Views are divine. Rooms are small but well designed with kitchens.All Residence Inns include breakfast.\\nCourtyard Cenral Park is in the same building.on lower floors (but still high). Rooms are a bit bigger and often cheaper than the RI but no included breakfast.\\nM Social is near both of these. It was formerly a Novotel and is rebranded and updated some and running intro rates.\\nThe Affinia hotels are all good and well run although not new, reasonably updated.\\nAffinia.com\\nThe Giraffe is a well lived boutique hotel in a relatively quiet spot but near lots of restaurants. It,s likely over budget, but maybe not.\\nLet us know what you find. I like the location of the Hyatt Union Square, to but it’s going to be more than $275 a night. It’s more like $400 a night. Same with the W union square.\\nI would suggest going a little bit north of Union Square to the flat iron district- very nice little safe neighborhood with subway connections (to Port authority bus and beyond) - not extremely quiet but nice and much *quieter* than Midtown. I would look at these hotels to stay in budget:\\nThe Ace hotel NY\\nThe Hotel Henri\\nThe Paul\\nThe James\\nThe Mondrian Park Ave NYwhiz…Thank you so much for your reply…I was hoping you would weigh in on this. Actually, one bed would be fine. We had been looking at Casablanca, but I like the fact that the Giraffe has lots of restaurants nearby. Will definitely consider Residence Inn and Courtyard, too. I appreciate your help!!\\nEdited: 5:25 pm, July 04, 2021 Thank you to all who helped here—I will look at all suggestions! The location of the Giraffe is much quieter than the Casablanca. You may know they\\'re part of the same hotel group noted for service. The Giraffe also has a very nice roofdeck for guests and a continental breakfast.\\nAll the hotels mentioned in post #5 are nearish the Giraffe but not all are getting good reviews right now. The Mondrian Park Ave. is very nearby and a good option if it\\'s cheaper.\\nI should add most hotels will be near lots of restaurants but the area near Madison Square Park where the Giraffe and Mondrian are, has a goodly number of well regarded ones at all prices. On June 18, a vaccination site was opened at the Empire State Building on the 80th floor and operates on Friday though Sunday until the Fourth of July Weekend. Those who comes there to be vaccinated have free access to the 86th floor observation deck to enjoy the views. What do you think about this.\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayo ... bservatory I think it\\'s great. What do you think of this? Why are you asking? “ until the Fourth of July Weekend.”\\nIt’s over, and the link in the OP is dead. So it’s pretty much moot whatever anyone thinks of it. Hi all, i was wondering does anyone know a reliable taxi company who makes a journey from queens new york to ottawa canada? I will be arriving to jfk on the 29th of june, staying in queens then the next day will be doing the journey. I have seen booking.com but the reviews are awful. Orbitz, enterprise, budget are not showing this choice on their website. What happened to all of the suggestions you already got?\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g181722-i2622-k13557697-Crossing_at_the_3_nations_bridge_from_us_to_canada-Cornwall_Ontario.html#110031369\\nEdited: 3:27 am, June 06, 2021 Tried the website of all the taxi companies i was provided, non provided me with a choice to cross the borders. Booking.com gave me that option and i was willing to take it, until i read the reviews of people booking and paying never hearing from the driver and their money was not refunded, and i am talking about more than a thousand dollars in taxi fares in my case, so great risk. Contacted blacklane company waiting still to hear there feedback. I am considering now several ports of entry, massena cornwall, thousand islands, obdensburg\\nEdited: 3:47 am, June 06, 2021 I am even considering taking a flight to bufflo using delta then from there to the rainbow bridge , crossing by foot, then uber to ottawa, but i fear that the canadian government might force me to confine in toronto while i have a reserved airbnb waiting for me in ottawa.\\nEdited: 3:52 am, June 06, 2021 A 500 mile taxi ride? I doubt you will find that for under $1000.\\nWhat is your budget for this quest?\\nYou might just have to follow quarantine rules. They are there for a reason\\nEdited: 8:04 am, June 06, 2021 Canada is VERY Strict about the Quarantine rule, there are huge fines if you dont follow them.\\nI would seriously cancel this trip. Even if somehow the border is open, it will likley only be for vaccinated americans.\\nAnd There is a good chance they might not even let you into canada. You wil have spent all this money and then get turned away at the border.\\nBTW Im not sure the US will allow you in either the US doesnt allow many foreign nationals at this time due to covid I live near the northern border towns and I think going through Buffalo would be your best bet. We just don\\'t have a lot of options up here (Ogdensburg, Massena) during the best of times, let alone during covid restrictions.\\nEdited: 10:27 am, June 06, 2021 @howardform, +10 = too many random variables and the OP must somehow be unknowing of all of the current restrictions regarding the pandemic. Kind of scratching my head over the whole illogical idea. Safe travels. I am not saying this is the best way to go, but it is possible to take the Amtrak train from Penn Station, NYC, to Montreal and then VIA trains or buses to Ottawa, The connection times may not be convenient. OP\\'s other post, which I linked, explains why she is required, and permitted, to enter Canada by land. I am vaccinated, and i will have done the pcr at my home country and again in jfk and at the canadian borders. That is not the issue. As far as the quarantine, who said anything about not following them, i have an airbnb waiting for me in ottawa reserved for one month, it is a taxi drive from borders to it. It’s still the greatest city in the world. And it’s been great for locals to be able to experience it without tourist crowds for a time. But that time is over. NYC is coming back stronger.\\nAnd new hotel in Times Square w views of the ball drop - a new opportunity for many! https://t.co/FTueVJFbIH?amp=1 I am glad - but, I (personally) am not looking forward to 66 million tourists each year.\\nTo a large extent, crowds can be avoided but especially for museums, I found it incredibly unpleasant at times. Before it all overflows again I am making my way through the museums I have really missed spending time in\\nIt is great to see so much more energy and life again. I wonder how expensive those hotel rooms with views of the ball drop will be? I\\'m assuming fairly astronomical, but we shall see. It could possibly be worth it though, since standing outside all day for the ball drop is a wast of time - for someone like me but clearly not for the million or so people who does this annually when it isn\\'t a pandemic on. It’s super hard MCat. I agree that sometimes the crowds are painful. I’ve only been on the Highline twice (I think) during the pandemic and it was a joy to be there. I know that once the crowds come back, that ends. No way will I battle those crowds. So I want to try to get there one more time before I say “goodbye”. And my neighborhood on weekends gets completely overrun. I don’t even (can’t even) try to avoid ruining photo ops when I walk out the front door of my building. There’s just too many.\\nBut that’s the price of living in such a great city. And it’s the price I’m willing to pay, even if it’s painful sometimes. (Once tourism comes back, I am definitely open to exploring discounts or select times for city-tax paying locals, or some such measures. I find it frustrating that there are store discounts, for example, for tourists, but those of us paying obscene taxes have no relief). It is great to see energy and life but not great to be tripping over wheelies again -- for me this is what I experienced yesterday at the Union Square greenmarket and again on W 28 St (and with yet 2 more sliver hotels going up on S side of street that is going to get worse). What do concierges do -- tell their guests if they want real \"insider,\" \"hidden gem\" NYC experiences, once they check out they need to take their wheelies and bags of what not and go clog the aisles of the stalls at the market and the shops on W 28 St? @4 Chances are those are people with night time flights but were required to checkout early, so they end up wandering the street with their bags. Probably a good business opportunity if it doesn\\'t already exist is to open up a place for temporary bag storage in union square. An inexperienced tourist may not think to have the hotel hold their bag until they are ready to head to the airport, but most tourists will realize once they have left their hotel and start logging the luggage through the streets that storing their baggage somewhere will make their final hours more enjoyable. The NY Times article linked in the original post says, near the end of the article, that the new hotel, the Margaritaville Resort, will have a view of the New Year\\'s Eve ball drop from its rooftop cafe. But, the hotel will be located at 7th Ave. and 40th St., south of the ball drop site. The ball goes down the north-facing 43rd St. side of 1 Times Square. Even if the Margaritaville is high enough for viewers on its rooftop to see 1 Times Square beyond the intervening buildings, it will take -- what? 10 seconds? -- for the ball to go down past the roof edge and be hidden from their view. Maybe the hotel will have jumbo TV screens for watching the rest of the ball\\'s journey down to the New Year. “ 4 Chances are those are people with night time flights but were required to checkout early, so they end up wandering the street with their bags. “\\nI wonder why they’re not just leaving them with the bell desk at their hotel?\\n“Probably a good business opportunity if it doesn\\'t already exist is to open up a place for temporary bag storage in union square”\\nVertoe. It already existed. But I can imagine in the world of Covid it may not be as much of a thing right now. I just spent the last 40 minutes trying to book a brunch reservation for next Sunday. Everything was booked, I had to use my sooner-dipper uber secret connections to get a table. I think the city is back! So glad you posted this, Risa - I was thinking along similar lines...less about tourism (my immediate neighborhood got few tourists even pre-pandemic), more about the city, well, reawakening. Part of it is the lovely spring weather, part of it is seeing faces again (people are still being cautious, but more are forgoing masks outdoors), part of it is the increased hum of activity. It feels like a collective sigh of relief.\\nThis weekend I went to the Botanic Gardens and ran into friends from two different spheres of my life; went to Prospect Park and ran into someone from a third (hadn’t seen them in well over a year); met up with a group from my husband’s bike club for outdoor beers after a ride (no requirement to buy food we didn’t want... we brought our own, just like in the old days).\\nI’m starting to think about museums and galleries and restaurants and excursions to different neighborhoods in a way I haven’t in a long time. Thanks Linda! Yes, it\\'s feeling very good! I haven\\'t had any random run ins, yet (SO unusual for me!), but I have seen people that didn\\'t go out at ALL this whole time, and went to an extraordinary new restaurant that was hopping (even outdoors). I\\'ve resumed taking the subway, which I wasn\\'t comfortable on before (personal choice). I keep my mask on, but not over my nose until I approach groups or crowded streets. I noticed a lot of people are doing the same - wearing a mask in no biggie anymore. I think there is going to be a brief period that the city will \"belong\" to locals, and then will explode with tourism again. (I always thought this would happen). I am confident that there will be many new innovations to the way we do business, take care of our health, have access to services, and attend to disenfranchised communities after this. All that is good, and long overdue. I will never stop mourning all of the lives lost. But NYC will not just survive, it will thrive. Does anyone know if this is up and running or has COVID stopped it? Are there other night markets? I may be getting Brooklyn confused with others? Maybe I\\'m thinking of Queens night market. Looks like it\\'s going strong! What do you know about it? Not sure about Brooklyn\\nBesides the one Corona there\\'s a new one that recently started in St. Albans Park (SE Queens)\\nhttps://gothamist.com/food/spurred-organic-food-providers-southeast-queens-grows-night-market The Brooklyn Night Bazaar - which I never managed to get to - closed pre-pandemic when they lost their space:\\nhttps://www.brooklynpaper.com/brooklyn-night-bazaar-to-close-in-november/\\nI’ve been to the Queens Night Market a few times in years past, and hope to make it back this summer. Loved the food, and they had music and kids activities, too.\\nEdited: 7:20 pm, July 03, 2021 Isn\\'t there an inexpensive hotel in NYC that has an indoor/outdoor swimming pool? I cannot find any... That\\'s one of the main things we want to do while staying there. You will need to define what \"inexpensive\" means to you. the peninusla on 5th has a lovely roof top pool but it is for sure not inexpensive\\njust search on trivago or tripadvisoror similar - many hotel pools are small and just plunge pools NYC doesnt have Motels with outdoor pools, Maybe a hotel outside the city might have that New York City, at least not Manhattan, is not a good place to visit if you want a swimming vacation. You would be better off staying in the suburbs and coming into the city on the days when you aren\\'t swimming. Also note that, with regard to the few hotels that actually have pools you can swim in, they are generally for swimming laps, not for kids to let off steam at the end of the day. Also note that, if you do find a hotel with a pool in your price range, it may or may not be open and it may or may not be operating with restrictions. Because of COVID (and fact that there may be unvaccinated and/or infected people in hotels), some operate this way. The Peninsula, for example, currently requires that guests make appointments to use pool. There are a number of hotels with outdoor pools and people are not doing laps in them. More likely hanging out by the pool, take a dip to cool off and then a sip of a $18 cocktail. The rooftop pool on top of the Gansevort is quite a nice spot. I think the price of a room there is reasonable. At least for NYC. YMMV.\\nhttps://ny.curbed.com/maps/nyc-hotels-indoor-pools-rooftop-spa The OP asked for swimming pools, not cocktail pools. Yes, cocktail pools are all the rage, but only a fool would even think of putting anything other than a toe in one. Check the Travel Inn on 42nd near 10th. It\\'s relatively inexpensive & had an indoor pool. Please note, I haven\\'t been there in forever as I found the place a bit seedy & I heard it might be shutting down.\\nEdited: 4:56 pm, July 01, 2021 Travel Inn is closed. They may re-open, but not available right now. I don\\'t know if it will be within your price range, but The William Vale Hotel in Brooklyn has the largest hotel pool in the city and it\\'s really nice (pre-covid anyway).\\nIt\\'s all outdoors but if you\\'re worried about shade, they have umbrellas and cabanas and a shaded area around the back which has a view over to Manhattan.\\nhttps://www.thewilliamvale.com/vale-pool/\\nIt\\'s not far from there into Manhattan. The L train will get you to Union Square in 15 minutes (including walking to the Bedford Ave station). I\\'m traveling to Dallas in a week and half. I\\'m flying early morning on American Airlines out of LaGuardia. Where is the best spot to grab breakfast before my flight? Do you want a sit down breakfast like eggs or pancakes or will a takeway breakfast of a breakfast sandwich & cup of coffee do? You can check the lga website for all of the amenities by terminal (AA is terminal B). https://www.ifly.com/la-guardia-airport/LGA-Terminal-B#maps While I haven\\'t flown in a year, my recollection is a lot of places didn’t open early enough for really early flights. And it doesn\\'t indicate the hours on the website linked. Perhaps this is more helpful.\\nhttps://www.laguardiab.com/food\\nWhen I traveled recently, I researched the restaurants at the airport I was going to be…on line menu was wrong, hours were wrong. But for me, it was a good place to start. I found what I needed (was looking for a wine bar), even if I had to tweak it once I got there.\\nOnce I found the list of restaurants, I went to the individual restaurants for their hours and menus. They don’t make it easy.\\nFor breakfast, I would wing it. But that’s me.\\nEdited: 9:20 pm, June 14, 2021 A quick breakfast or a sit down is fine with me. I\\'m going to have some time to kill. I just want to unwind before my flight. I don\\'t know how early your flight is but, pre-pandemic, I had a Delta LGA flight at 6 or 6.30 for the first time in my life and nothing was open before I had to get to gate. I was looking for a newsstand, and one did start to open at very last minute as I headed to gate, but it had no newspapers. I don\\'t think anything really starts to open until about 6, but if that is when your flight is, it\\'s just too late. According to the Shake Shack website, the location at LaGuardia (terminal B) opens at 5am and serves breakfast sandwiches until 10:30am. Just bring a hard-boiled egg or two and a piece of fruit and eat it prior to security. I eat nearly everything. Eggs are not my thing. A great muffin will do. To be perfectly honest, the airport is not where I would expect to find a \"great\" muffin. I would probably be grateful to just find one that wasn\\'t a week or two old. You might be better off buying a great, fresh muffin near where you live the day before, wrapping it in plastic, and taking it to airport with you. Has anyone done the Harbor Cruises? I think it might be nice to see the city lights from the water. I took a private cruise several years ago that left just before sunset so we saw the city in daylight and then in darkness with the buildings all aglow. It is a stunning sight that I recommend to all. You can actually see more than what many expect from the water. We have done many of them. Most are great. Some are crowded and less Great. Read the reviews. You usually get what you pay for\\nEdited: 8:25 pm, July 02, 2021 I did the sunset cruise a few years ago and loved it. You leave when the sun is still up and you come back to the city lights in all their glory ! I have done two of the cruises by Classic Harbor lines that nywhiz links to above and loved them and highly recommend them. We did the weekend brunch one and the City Lights one, which gives you the city lit up at night. The first was great and the second, spectacular!\\nThe City Lights one was shorter, no narration, just soft music and was very relaxing. Amazing, dramatic night time views of the skyline. It\\'s billed as a \"romantic\" cruise though, so there were quite a few canoodling couples on board. But my daughter and I didn\\'t feel that out of place.\\nThe brunch one was fun, but because it navigates the whole circumference of the island, it felt long. I see that the open buffet tables have been replaced by three-course prix fixe menu served at your table, which is something I would hope continues even post-pandemic as it\\'s a small space and it was a little pushy around the buffet. The table service would be much more relaxing and elegant.\\nI have also used the New York Water Taxi which has boats decked out in yellow and black like the NYC taxis, which was really fun, but it looks like they are operating as a private charter company for now.\\nAnd there\\'s also the public NYC Ferry service which has a lot of routes and can get you from place to place and give you a great view at the same time, economically.\\nferry.nyc Many of us know about the great deals being offered with the opening special at M Social Times Square. (You have to book by July 31 and stay by March 31.) But I stumbled across something interesting on booking.com in the hotel\\'s answer to a question about the facilities (resort) fee. They say \"The hotel charges a facility fee of $28.69 including tax per night if booked from now until July 5th, and $40.17 including tax per night if booked from July 6th moving forward.\"\\nSo that\\'s a big jump of $11.48 per night if you wait to book. (Which, in the big scheme of things is not a lot of money, but why give away money that you don\\'t have to?)\\nThe rate has free cancellation until 2pm one day prior, so no need to delay. Greetings! We are arriving 6am at JFK in July, taking a taxi to Moynihan Hall to catch a later afternoon train to Boston. Husband wants to get a WC, not for the movie, he wants to taste one, he won’t eat the frozen ones here at home. I know, I know.. lol. We travel a lot and typically don’t seek out fast food, but…this is on his bucket list. On maps looks like one or two on the way to Manhattan, and one up in East Harlem. We could Uber up to the one in Harlem from the train, will the driver let us run in and grab some food and take us back? Or, with a nice extra tip, will a driver take us throttle drive through after leaving JFK? Used lots of Uber and Lyft in our travels but never specifically for something like this? Before I actually ask a driver and risk looking like an out of town yokol , I thought it would be better to ask here and get some advice. This will be our 2nd trip to the city. We can do the Subway too, just seems a little sketchy these days, we loved them on our 1st trip however. Thank you for any advice you can give me!! If it’s on the subway route into manhattan, I would do that. I’m sure you can add the stop by Uber, but they will charge you. A round trip Uber from Moynihan to East Harlem could easily be $100 - the costs have gone way up.\\nYou can take the subway. Keep your eye on people (without looking like you’re staring) and stay aware. But otherwise riding the subway is normal activity.\\nThe only reason for using Uber or cab would be if you have a lot of luggage and getting on and off the subway would be too cumbersome. Well, I suppose you could take the taxi from JFK to the White Castle on Northern and Bell blvds. in Bayside (213-17 Northern Blvd, Bayside, NY 11361). This is near the Bayside LIRR station (Port Washington Branch) to Penn Station, Manhattan. This is a bit out of the way and you would have to be certain you would be on time for the Boston trip.\\nEdited: 12:00 pm, June 27, 2021 Thank you Risa and Fox11354, that did help so definitely the Uber up to Harlem from the train station is def out. With our luggage I think the only option for stopping at a WC, would be the location where you mentioned Fox11354 , and ask a cab or Uber if we pay them a little more to go through the drive-through real quick, I’m sensitive to their time frames and how quickly they need to get from point A to point B to make a living , don’t want to be an irritating tourist. Outside of that It looks like that would have to be for another trip. Pulling all of our luggage into a white castle would look odd at best, haha. We did take the train on our first trip from JFK into the city with luggage it wasn’t too bad but we didn’t have to make any additional stops. Thank you both for your help that was One of the last details I was puzzled about, I appreciate it!! And my only advice to someone who’s never been on a subway train before , make sure you’re holding onto some thing when it takes off! 😂 … don’t ask. You could possibly get a taxi to do this (it would be on the meter and would definitely add up!) but I wouldn’t expect this as a possibility with an Uber— while you might be able to slip someone $20 to wait while you run in somewhere , the ride back downtown would have to be booked through the app too for them to get paid for it…sounds more complicated than any city Uber drive I know would want to deal with. As far as I know you can’t book multi stops.\\nAnyway, to me it wouldn’t make any sense to do it that way from the train station to harlem. There’s a central harlem White Castle off 125th, a block away from the 2,3 train station or a block and a half from the A,C(b,d) trains, the A, 2 and 3 trains all run express to Penn Station, so would be a quicker and easier (and cheaper) to use the subway for that trek. (The East Harlem location would be much less convenient via public transit from the train station though). You can connect directly to Moynihan hall from the A train at Penn. (my presumption here is that the reason you would be going straight to the train station would be to store luggage , and not have to lug it on the subway)\\nEdited: 12:46 pm, June 27, 2021 From JFK take Queens blvd towards The City and in Elmhurst there’s a White Castle close to the Queens Mall and Macy’s. Last I looked there’s still one there. On the right side of Queens Blvd heading into the city.\\n89-03 57th avenue. Elmhurst Queens 11373\\nIt’s my old stomping ground. And it’s still there. If you take an Uber or Lyft you could probably get the driver to wait for you or invite him in for some sliders.\\nGlad to see I’m not the only one likes specific food and will go out of my way for it. AMS, thank you yes ! that’s exactly what we were going to do is drop the luggage off at the train station lock it up and then takeoff from there and head out we’ve got about eight hours to just kick around the city. Thank you for the train connect information. Hello SuzanneC,\\nI use to walk pass the White Castle in East Harlem pre pandemic (for the gym).\\nFrom what I have seen; there have been times that it has been busy with long lines. I am not sure how it is presently.\\nThere is a pre order and pick up option at this location. Not sure how it works. But, certainly something to look into if you are pressed for time. Make sure you’re near a bathroom for a few hours afterwards, they don’t call them murder burgers for nothing. P.S - the location in East Harlem (351 E 103RD ST) has a drive through. MonteBurns, oh that is terrific location information thank you. Yes I was thinking that too, to invite the driver to a meal at least put it out there to make it worth their time and we would be super fast like running in 10 minutes and running back out again. We would never make the driver feel obligated or uncomfortable we would only just ask once and if they said no that’s cool we’re OK with that , as working people we get it. Haha oh yeah, you understand us then , food experiences , however simple or extravagant they might be , make the trips memorable 😁👍👍 Hi Experts,\\nNeed support on few queries I have in my mind before travelling to New York for 5 nights with my 5 year old daughter:\\n- What is recommended mode of transport from JFK Airport to Manhattan area and how much would it cost?\\n- Where do we get a local SIM from and how much will be the charges?\\n- Recommended place for local food?\\n- 228 West 47th Street, New York, is this safe and move around at night?\\n- Any recommendation/guidelines to go around the place?\\n- Are there any trekking/hiking spots nearby the city center?\\n- What is the best mode of transport to move around the city?\\nThanks in advance! Your location is just west of Times Square proper and seems to have average rates of robbery. Nearby, the Bus Terminal on 42nd and 8th Ave. has more problems, but not what I would call extremely serious. One has to exercise caution in all urban places and not do foolish things like wandering the street drunk in the early morning. It might be easier to take a taxi from JFK with a child and luggage. There is a fixed rate for this with some added fees at times. Getting around the city is fastest by subway, but that offers no view of the place. Buses can be rather slow depending on the length of the trip. I suppose one could hike around Central Park for a natural area experience. For serious hiking, one would likely have to leave the city for Bear Mountain as just one example.\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page\\nEdited: 6:46 am, July 02, 2021 The easiest mode of transportation between JFK and the city is a cab which offers a flat rate.\\nI do believe you can get a SIM card at the airport, however, have you checked with your phone company if they offer a trip package?\\nFor food, it all depends on what you like, there are pizzerias almost every corner but higher end restaurants all over the city. A type of food and budget would help to answer that particular question\\nYour hotel, although not directly in Times Square, is close enough for your daughter to go enjoy the M&M and Disney stores.\\nFor your daughter, I would suggest a visit to see Winnie the Pooh and Friends at the New York Public Library and maybe a visit to the American Girl Store.\\nFor a nice walk, I would suggest Central Park and the Highline. There is also Little Island.\\nThe best mode of transportation is on foot and on the subway, anything else, as far as I\\'m concerned, just gets stuck in traffic.\\nEdited: 7:19 am, July 02, 2021 For myself. the best part of food in NYC is that there is a world wide variety of food. I guess the most iconic of food is bagels & pizza & those shops are found all over the city. Since both are considered on the low end of the budget you can get those anywhere & not spend a lot. There is not one “city center” where everything is concentrated. You will want to see sights all over. Manhattan alone is 13.5 miles north to south and 2.3 miles east to west. There are somewhere between 8,000-10,000 restaurants. “Local food” is an amalgam of all kinds of ethnicities. (To me, “local food” is Italian). You need to describe whether you’re looking for fast food or sit down meals, and what your budget is, and locations you want to go. Downtown restaurants are more fun than stuffier midtown restaurants or places that cater to tourists. What are you looking for? For your sim card, don\\'t buy at the airport, especially not from one of the machines. I usually go to a T-Mobile store after checking in to my hotel (and the hotel has free wifi while I\\'m there), to buy a sim card. They used to have a Tourist Sim good for up to 3 weeks but they don\\'t seem to have that anymore.\\nLook up the T-Mobile pre-paid plans. And also look for AT&T pre-paid plans. No ID is required for pre-paid plans.\\nAnother option if you have time is to buy online from something like Simcorner and they\\'ll send you the sim card via mail. You just activate it on arrival in the USA. Taxis at JFK Airport charge a flat fare of $52 for trips between the airport and anywhere in Manhattan. Taxis impose a $4.50 surcharge during peak hours (4-8 p.m. weekdays, excluding holidays), for a fare of $56.50. Add a tip to this, so allow around $70.00 in total\\nOnly go to the official yellow taxi line outside the terminal. Hello I am a frequent domestic traveler to New York City I agree that the best mode transportation from JFK into Manhattan is a taxi if you can afford it. If not, take public transportation.\\nInstall Citymapper app to your smart phone, it will tell you how to get around New York City , not just to and from and from JFK. ANY mode can be choosen in real time - taxi ,walking, bus , subway, ferry ,commuter train or a combination. I learned the geography just by using this app. Now I know my way around like an expert. I don’t have to ask anyone for directions.\\nI agree with the poster who mentioned hiking around Central Park it’s over 800 acres.\\nFor local food ,do you mean American food? Do you eat meat? Shake shack is a great place for gourmet hamburgers ,chicken ,hotdogs, milkshakes ! etc. there’s many locations around the city.\\nAs for safety, As in all big cities keep your wits about you f someone is creepy, ignore and get away. If you feel uncomfortable hail a taxi , get out of the situation. The Port Authority bus terminal area @ west 42nd and 8th ave should be avoided IMO and Penn staton area has some scruffy characters as well IMO be extra aware aware there.\\nEdited: 8:23 pm, July 02, 2021 I have visited with my 5 year old daughter and Central Park was a highlight. The various playgrounds, the Ramble, The Alice in Wonderland Statue, the Zoo... Just wandering around and exploring. The Museum of Natural History is also convenient to Central Park. There are a variety of Carousels that are fun and in different areas - Jane\\'s Carousel in DUMBO, The Seaglass Carousel in Battery Park, the Central Park Carousel. In honour of the essential workers that went out every day during the pandemic and did their duty, a new monument in Battery Park has just broken ground.\\nThe memorial will include a circle of 19 maple trees, representing the 19 individual groups of essential workers and their contributions. In the center, an eternal flame will honor those lost to COVID.\\nConstruction is expected to wrap up by Labor Day on September 6.\\nMore info:\\nhttps://www.6sqft.com/new-york-to-install-circle-of-heroes-monument-in-battery-park-city-to-honor-essential-workers/\\nhttps://newyorkyimby.com/2021/06/construction-breaks-ground-on-circle-of-heroes-monument-in-battery-park-city-manhattan.html And the Sanitation Department has unveiled a statue in honour of their members who were lost.\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/nyregion/nyc-virus-memorials.html\\nI would also like to see a monument of some sort for the thousands of ordinary citizens who lost their lives at the start of the pandemic and who were buried in mass graves. Such an undignified way to die and be lost. Not so fast.\\nThey have not “just broken ground” nor will they.\\nhttp://tribecatrib.com/content/you-have-my-apologies-bpc-chief-calls-monument-site-mistake\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/07/02/cuomo-gives-up-covid-memorial-in-battery-park-after-backlash/\\nhttps://news.artnet.com/art-world/cuomo-memorial-controversy-1984756\\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/locals-protest-cuomos-plan-install-essential-workers-monument-battery-park-city I hope it goes ahead somewhere no matter what. I’m researching a future trip to Philadelphia, NYC, and Boston, most likely in the summer months. We (husband and I) would fly into Philadelphia and fly out of Boston, and take the train between cities. Right now, I’m trying to get a feel for how many days to allot to each area. If you could give me feedback on my tentative NYC plans, I’d appreciate it! My main question is whether I have enough days set aside to visit the sites on my list.\\nThe days are in no particular order and can be shuffled around.\\nArrival Day (via train from Philadelphia): Afternoon/evening train; check into hotel\\nDay 1: Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island Hard Hat Tour; Federal Hall Tour\\nDay 2: Hayden Planetarium (and other exhibits as time permits) at the AMNH; taping of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert (assuming we get tickets)\\nDay 3: Central Park; Highlights Tour at the Met (we\\'re not really art museum people, but this is one that I feel I need to visit, if for no other reason than my fondness for the book, \"From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\")\\nDay 4: 9/11 Memorial and Museum; afternoon tour of the Federal Reserve; other Wall Street sights\\nDay 5: United Nations tour / afternoon train to Boston\\nThe following are also priorities ... where might they best fit in?\\n• one of the observatories (Empire State Building or Top of the Rock)\\n• NYPL ... quick visit to see the original Winnie the Pooh and friends\\nThere are many other places I\\'ve researched that I\\'d be happy to put in the itinerary if there is time (or if I add days), but I\\'ve found that two main activities per day are what we can handle. We especially enjoy National Park type sites like the Statue of Liberty or Federal Hall. Are there any other National Park sites that I\\'ve missed?\\nThanks for your feedback! You are missing Central Park and the High Line Id say 2 Days in Boston, The main thing in Boston is the Freedom trail, you can do that in a day Be aware that Winnie is not at the main library building with the lions, but across Fifth Ave. below 40th St. in the lower level. This former department store was rebuilt in recent years. Fox has Winne the Pooh and his friends moved? I always go see them by entering the building between the 2 lions. They were, the last time I visited, in the Children\\'s Corner.\\nEdited: 7:11 am, July 02, 2021 There is a 3rd abservatory in the area of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum & that is the One World Observatory. Unlike the other 2, it\\'s not in the central part of Manhattan but it\\'s higher than the other 2 & would fit in nicely on day 4. Blumebwaybaby, thanks for the suggestion. I’ll look into that.\\nFox11354, the library website shows that Winnie is at the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building. Is this the same location that you are referring to?\\nHowardform, I have Central Park listed on Day 3. My take is that for a summer visit, you have schedule a LOT of tours.\\nOne of the best things about NYC year round, but especially in the warmer months, is being able to just walk around and bump into an interesting area/fair/experience. With tours, I feel that you are locked out of that. I saw mention of Pooh being at the Children\\'s Center in the renovated building. This has reopened recently.\\nhttps://www.nypl.org/locations/snfl/childrens Fox11354, thanks for the info. This trip is far in the future, so I will definitely confirm where Pooh is residing before visiting! ter1413, my husband has a visual impairment and we\\'ve found that tours, either guided by a docent or self-guided audio tours, work well for us because he gets more enjoyment auditorily than visually. (Also, it means I don\\'t have to read aloud every plaque we come across and annoy other visitors, lol!) Hello NY friends,\\nNeed some help with my NY city itinerary. We the family of 4 ( Husband, Wife, 2 teenager) flying to NYC on 7th morning. Staying in Time square Marquees for 5 night. I also got NY pass for 3 days as its out first visit and wants to cover as many tourist places we can.\\nWe are planning to start using our pass from 8th morning with hop n hop bus and then will cover all major attractions like Empire state, Edge, Liberty, 9/11 Memorial, one world , circle line cruise, Central park, Brooklyn bridge, Rockefeller, Guggenheim museum, china town, Met etc. Eat some famous pizza and cheap shopping ( if its for real:)\\nGetting really confused on how to group them based on each day itinerary and also what all can we do on 7th and on 11th when we don\\'t have NY pass to use.\\nAs broadway is not open ..is there anything related which we can do..\\nAny help is good help ..Big thanks !! The bad news is that we don\\'t recommend any attraction passes for the restrictions & somewhat deceptive advertising they use (you don\\'t get nearly as much as they seem to advertise.)\\nHopefully the day you want to use the HOHO bus is nice because using one in less than optimal weather can be a miserable experience (I speak from experience.) One tip we do give people who have bought HOHO tickets is to resist the urge to Hop ON & Off when you 1st get on the bus & take a full loop 1st & then figure out where you want to stop on a 2nd loop. . Reply part 2 - you need to get ahold of a tourist map However, the HOHO bus may give you one. You also could use a guidebook but it\\'s a holiday weekend so you may not have time to go to the library & take one out or want to invest in one from a book store. When you get to the hotel, see if they have one or mare free tourism magazines which you can use as a map & a guidebook. oops ..I wish I knew before buying the pass. I will try to use that at least to get the worth of money I spent on it. Thanks for your advice about taking one full loop on bus before hopping off and on. I forgot to address your theater question. Right now, there are few theater options right now. There is Bruce Springteen on Broadway which is a concert/theater blend starring Springsteen but I think the show is basically sold out. There is a show at the Darryl Roth Theater called Blindness where the play takes place in total darkness & you wear headphones & tickets are sold in blocls of two. Other than that there\\'s not much else. I will be in New York this weekend and want to find a good place to view the fireworks. I was thinking of going to Hunter\\'s Point, but the Macy\\'s website says this is a \"not suggested\" for viewing area. Why wouldn\\'t this be a good viewing area?\\nI am staying near South Street Seaport and considering taking a ferry towards 34th street during the fireworks. Is this a good ideea and how hard is it to get on these ferries?\\nThanks Why not from the South Street Seaport itself?\\nThe ferries might not be operating right before the event. Might be hard to get off of them and find space to stand in\\nEdited: 1:08 pm, July 02, 2021 I caught the fireworks from the Seaport years ago. It was PACKED!\\nNot sure what this year will look like, but if you want to watch them at the Seaport, be prepared to spend most of the afternoon/evening holding down your spot. This year they are going to be farther upriver near Midtown. Macy\\'s website says Seaport South is not a good place to view the fireworks. It is likely all venues will be extremely crowded this year. You will have to come early to get a spot and be without the necessities of life for several hours. Afterwards, the subways will be packed with returnees. I never found the fireworks on TV very satisfying as they keep changing the viewpoint and you get no sense of the real event. Hello, all. I have had schedule changes to my existing reservation which changed everything. Now I am looking at having to make an airport transfer from LaGuardia to Newark EWR in October. Does anyone know what is the status of shuttles, etc., and approximate costs for this per person? TIA! How much time do you have?\\nWhat day of the week and time of day?\\nIs this on one ticket so you have some protection if you miss the second flight?\\nAll shuttles are still suspended - and I don\\'t think there ever was one between LGA and EWR https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides\\nYour choices are public transport - one bus and three trains OR a cab or car service - which will be expensive\\nChange this if you can. I agree with what Kaye says. It\\'s bound to be annoying, at the least, if you have to travel from Queens, east of NYC, to Newark NJ, west of the city.\\nI don\\'t believe there was ever any such shuttle between those two airports either. Try ETS Airport Shuttle, toll free 866-864-7433, prices vary including luggage, etc.\\nhttps://www.etsairportshuttle.com/ Sorry I didn’t realize the shuttle services were still not running. This is an awful and expensive transfer. Refuse it. Not only are you changing airports but you are also changing cities and states as well. I have heard of people being successful in changing there flights based on that Has anyone purchased attraction tickets through the Plum Benefits/Tickets-At-Work website?\\nThe have some good deals for things like ESB and such. Never heard of it - but it looks like your company has to join for you to get benefits. (We get similar offers from our credit cards - so we know they are legitimate offers to customers. How does this company make any money if they sell things at way below face value?)\\nIMHO always much better to buy directly from the venue you are going to - so you know they are legitimate. My company-a very large insurance company based in NYC-offers Plum Benefits.\\nThey are totally legit and you can only access then through your employer.\\nJust be sure what you are purchasing is not available from the vendor for the same price.\\nFor example, Broadway tickets are offered as discounted, but you just get a general area of where the tickets are located (depending on show can be as broad as Orchestra or Mezzanine). Some shows I looked at had same priced tickets, and I could pick my seat.\\nI have not looked specific attractions, so I would definitely look not only at Plum, but the site itself to guage if the cost of using the middleman is worth it. State of New York participates with Plum Benefits. I have bought attraction tickets from them at good rates and they are legit. But whenever I see Broadway discounts thru them, I can always find the same discount code from Theatremania and use the official seller. I have purchased with Tickets-At-Work and gotten some very good deals on shows in the past. It is legit. Just double check on pricing of tickets, as stated above. It isn\\'t always a good deal and often you cannot choose your own seats. If the attraction does not have a specific TIMED entry, then get your tickets through this program, if they are indeed discounted. Money saved, is money that can be used elsewhere. This is good for Empire state building, museums, etc.\\nBUT ... if it is an attraction with TIMED admission, do not bother if they cannot sell you timed tickets. For example, you if you get an untimed ticket for TOTR, you will need to turn it in for a specific time slot, which means you\\'d have to go to the ticket booth and get your timed ticket. It might be you get lucky and your entry time is 15 minutes in the future ... but it could be a couple of hours at peak times. it is a legitimate company. I purchased broadway tickets with them at a decent price but did not get my seat assignment until it was closer to my date. it was a side view in orchestra. I would be incredibly hesitant to use Plum Benefits. They\\'re customer service is HORRIFIC! If there are any mistakes or you need help with changing dates/cancellations they will fight you tooth and nail. I\\'m currently in a battle over broadway tickets bought for the wrong day by mistake. I\\'ve gone so far as to find their contact at Broadway and speak directly with her, she assured me that everything was taken care of. Plum Benefits has yet to issue a cancellation or date change.. Still waiting. Pay the extra cash and deal with the vendor, it\\'s not worth the headache.. trust me! They are scam! Be careful, my cousin bought tickets for a concert, the sent tickets for parking, we have proof of seat numbers and they said that was just a reference, we had to read the small letters. Now fighting through PayPal. My experience with Plum Benefits was good until today.\\nOn October, 25th 2018, I bought 2 tickets for the Empire State Building for a cost of $60, I\\'m sure that the \"Important Ticket Information\" was saying \"Valid for one year after purchase date\" when I got the tickets the expiration date was March 31st 2019, I didn\\'t see the date right away because I purchased them to use in April 2019 with my family coming to town.\\nAfter sending one email and calling twice, I talked with 2 agents and 1 manager.\\nThese are what I was told:\\n- \"when you purchased the ticket the general info was saying valid for 5 months after purchase date\", I\\'m pretty sure that it is not true\\n- \"we just changed the expiration date on these tickets, they now say that they are valid 1 year, when you purchased them, it was 5 months\"\\n- \"the Empire State Building are putting their info on our website so it is their responsibility, not ours\" (I checked with the Empire State Building, they say that the 3rd parties choose their own expiration date)\\n- \"I can offer you a gift card on a restaurants website but we can\\'t change the date\" (I declined it because I just wanted a longer expiration date)\\n-\" you live in Brooklyn, you are close to the Empire State Building so use them now\", I answered her that how and when I use my tickets are my business giving that I believed that I have 7 months more to use them\\n- \"you had all the information that you needed before buying the tickets\": the website mentioned just the period the tickets are valid for, you have the exact date only when you get the tickets. The tickets also mention that they are not refundable or exchangeable.\\nThe last agent I talked to screamed \"Aaaah...\" on the phone, she apologized for it but it was kind of disturbing...\\nSo I won\\'t use this website again.

I need some help figuring out which Marriott hotel in Manhattan to stay at that will make our logistics the easiest. We want to drop our bags at the hotel and then go by subway to a 1pm Yankees game. The next day we want to walk the High Line and take an evening cruise. Depending on your price limitations, I would look into the Residence Inn Central Park (Broadway at 54th St, entrance is on 54th St). Or the Courtyard in the same building on the lower floors (likely to be cheaper than the RI).\\nYou could take the D train straight up to Yankee Stadium (check google maps for the walk after getting off the train) and then it\\'s not a big walk to the High Line and cruise dock the next day (which cruise are you thinking of though, a couple leave from further downtown).\\nhttps://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycpr-residence-inn-new-york-manhattan-central-park/\\nhttps://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/nycpk-courtyard-new-york-manhattan-central-park/ We like the Renaissance Midtown, a 5 minute walk from Penn Station and the subway.

The train you,d take from Princeton is an Amtrak train which stops at Penn Station. The Renaissance mentioned above is close by.

Are you early risers?\\nYou don\\'t want to eat close to your hotel and prefer to head downtown?\\nDo you want a sit down meal with wait staff service or something more casual like a food court?\\nYou can catch the 6 train at 51st and Lex. You\\'ll need to make a free cross platform transfer to the 4 or 5 to get off at Bowling Green https://new.mta.info/map/5256 If time permits, you could get off the 6 train at the City Hall terminus and have a walk down to Battery Park\\nHere\\'s info on the other things to see downtown https://downtownny.com/explore/plan-your-trip/must-see-downtown/ Getting table service for 9 people is going to take a long time. If that’s what you want, allow plenty of time. While the subway trip downtown will likely take 30-40 mins. allow an hour.in case of slowdowns or other hiccups. Btw, your group should have a plan if you\\'re separated. Usually the advice is, if someone doesn,t get on the train, the others should get off at the next stop, stay where your subway car was and wait for the others.\\nNear your hotel, if you want a sitdown breakfast, NY Luncheonette (135 east 50 st.) is decent and very convenient . For faster breakfasts, in addition to Ess A Bagel, little Collins and Ground Central have good coffee and pastries.\\nEdited: 12:11 pm, July 01, 2021 I don\\'t eat a cooked breakfast, so I would likely walk down Lex to GCT entrance st at 43 and Lex to catch 4 or 5 train there, maybe stopping on way at Ole & Steen at 48 & Lex or Pret a Manger about a block south of Ole to pick up something to take to eat in Battery Park, though likely sipping/nibbling a bit on way down. Actually, the Pret a Manger I was thinking of, at 46/47, may still be closed. However, there is one on same, east, side of Lex, a few blocks south, at 43/44, that I\\'m quite sure is open now. This question comes up regularly so I’ve made a copy-and-paste list of places for breakfast near the Statue ferries that I’ve noticed while walking around the area. George’s is the closest with table service; the others are counter service with some seating available. I have included cross streets because street numbers are mostly useless here.\\nAlso, based on conversations with tourists and with making this list, Google maps has a lot of problems with this area. One tourist I encountered had followed directions that were supposed to take her somewhere in Tribeca but she ended up in Battery Park (her input was correct; Google was wrong) and I wouldn’t trust the walking times or directions that came up for some of these places. Always check opening times!\\n. . . . .\\nGeorge’s, 89 Greenwich at Rector. Often recommended here. Traditional diner/coffee shop with table service. https://www.starbucks.com/store-locator/store/16686/state-st-pearl-streets-1-battery-park-plaza-new-york-ny-100041405-us\\nFlavors, 27 Whitehall (at Bridge Street—closest); also at 42 Broadway (a bit north of Bowling Green); 74 Broad Street (between Stone and Marketfield); and 175 Water Street (at John Street, much further away) but might be better depending where you’re coming from.\\nhttps://flavorsnyc.com\\nOpen Market, 15 William between William Street and Exchange Place.\\nopenmarket.nyc\\nBlue spoon, 90 William Street between Maiden Lane and Platt Street.\\nbluespooncoffee.com\\nStarbucks, 1 Battery Park Plaza but actually on State Street between Bridge and Pearl.

Such a good list, BBNYC!\\nAdd Blue Bottle Coffee at 22 Broad St, right next to the Stock Exchange.\\nAnd Split Eights for coffee or cocktails at 40 Exchange (across from Cucina Bene Pizza, which is REALLY good pizza). https://www.spliteightsnyc.com/ Ok. I’ll add Blue Bottle and there’s also Champs Deli on Exchange but I don’t know if either of these has seating,\\nAnd it was intended to be a breakfast list for people going to the SoL ferry in the mornings, so I don’t know if any of them would want cocktails or pizza then, but I could be wrong. :-)\\nBlue Bottle Coffee, 22 Broad Street. Between the stock exchange and CityMD. Have breakfast while you’re waiting for your PCR test results.\\nhttps://bluebottlecoffee.com/cafes/broad-st\\nChamps Gourmet Deli, 30 Broad Street but actually around the corner on Exchange Place. Don’t know if it has seating. “Gourmet” can mean anything in NYC.\\nhttps://www.champsdelinyc.com/ Champs is pretty much counter service/take out. Blue Bottle has blocked off tables in the street. Keep in mind that Broad Street is mostly closed to cars in this area (cars have to go through security), and in addition to the blocked off seating for Blue Bottle, there are tables and chairs across the street in front of the Hermes store for anyone to sit.\\nI mention the pizza place just for reference. ;) Hello!\\nOur family will be traveling to NYC July 13-18. We arrive the afternoon of July 13 and leave very early the 18th. Here is our itinerary.. is this doable?! Any suggestions? I also need help with Restaurants.. we love to eat and we are a foodie family. Love places off the beaten path that we can\\'t find back home (MN). THANK YOU!!! M\\nTuesday 13th-\\nArrive at hotel (Hampton Inn Manhattan Grand Central)\\nFigure we re-fuel with some food and hit some sites Need a lunch spot around this area..

Lunch puts you close to 4pm. Walking the bridge can be another hour with the stops/pics. No time to head out to CI, in my opinion.\\n-If you move CI to Sat, you are going from one end of the city to the other.\\n-I would have tried to schedule the BX tour on Friday being that you are going to the game later that evening, I could also see doing the Village tour and then changing before heading to the stadium. Hi.. Thank you!! Okay good to know the CI is too much on Wednesday I figured as much! Any restaurants choices around the Statue of Liberty? We will be hungry. The Bronx Hip Pop Tour is only available certain days so didn\\'t have much a choice there :-( Same for the Apple Greeter Tour had to happen on Friday. Statue of Libert to Katz to Wall St to Brooklyn Bridge-Dumo is out of the Way\\nWall St is near Statue of Liberty Ferry For those who do not know Big Apple Greeter, the OP does NOT have a special tour with a Big Apple Greeter. The OP has a meetup with a New York VOLUNTEER who will share his or her love of the Village with the OP and family. For dining choices it will be helpful if we have an idea of your budget/entree in $ & food likes & dislikes Lots of restaurants near the ferry to the SoL, not many near the statute itself. You\\'ll probably want a late breakfast, maybe near the hotel to increase your options and then head to the ferry If the SOL is your first thing on that day why not just have a big late breakfast to tide you over? For food we ARE NOT picky. We like Indian, Chinese, Korean, Sushi, American so really no issue there. Price point I\\'ll like lunch to be around $20 per person (minus drinks). Dinners we can splurge.... $35 to $40 per person.. more if is a GREAT Place.\\nWe are planning a heavier breakfast for SOL day BUT figured by the time we are done later in the afternoon we would be hungry so looking for a place to eat around that area. You can go to Brookfield Place for breakfast before SOL, there are numerous options on the second floor, take out with tables there. For a splurge, there is a Sant Ambroeus there for lunch after, if you wish.\\nFor your daughter\\'s splurge dinner, there are two Avra restaurants, one on East 48th, the other on E 60th. Both would work for you. They are Greek, food is great and a fun atmosphere. Feels splurge-y, but not over the top. Otherwise, Nobu on W 57th would be fun, but it would come to much more unless you simply do rolls (which, at Nobu, is a waste of their excellent sushi and creativity).\\nWhen you are on Wall St, you may want to consider walking over to Stone St. Lots of options and it\\'s very quaint, for lunch/late afternoon snacks. Glad to see someone partaking in Big Apple Greeter! Such a great program. I had one take two friends and I all through West Village, and surrounding areas. On another trip, a gentleman took just myself over to Brooklyn, The second was a retired heart surgeon and it was interesting just talking to him about his life as a doc in NYC. Hi we are planning a day near & in Harlem. The plan is to venture up from Midtown (via Uber?) to Graffiti Hall of Fame, Central Park Conservatory Gardens, cut through Central Park into Columbia University then see Alexander Hamilton’s historic home, then head back to midtown.\\nAny recommendations on some good restaurants along the way, like near Columbia U?\\nAlso please provide recommendations on which path to walk (and not walk)?\\nAny other advice is gladly accepted!\\nSam Not my neighborhood, but a few thoughts…\\nFirst off, no need to take an Uber uptown…the subway will serve you well, and will probably be quicker. Our streets are ridiculously clogged with traffic.\\nRight across from the conservatory gardens are two very interesting museums, the Museum of the City of NY and El Museo del Barrio. Either or both are worth checking out if you have the time. (Not sure of current hours/policies, but you can look those up as easily as I can.)\\nW. 116th St is Little Senegal, and is interesting & fun to stroll.\\nA few blocks west and south of Hamilton’s home, mainly along Broadway (but on some of the cross streets as well) is the Audubon Mural Project, which is fantastic if you like nature, street art, or both (in fact, if you like both, I’d say it’s a must see). More info here:\\nhttps://www.audubon.org/amp\\nAs far as places to eat go - as I said, it’s not my neighborhood, and I don’t get up there very often. If it were me, I’d gravitate away from the places around Columbia and toward Senegalese in Harlem or maybe Dominican in Washington Heights. There’s also a good Ecuadorian restaurant, Ecuatoriana, on Amsterdam btwn 143/144. (That’s where I ate when I went up to see the Audubon murals.) But I don’t know what kind of food you like… Some of the places you mention are in East Harlem. Can take the green line 6 train maybe 4 stops there as well up to 103rd and just walk over or if it easier to catch the Q then just ride it up to the last stop 96th street and walk across to the park. then head north to the gardens and the graffiti hall of fame. As mentioned there are other museums in close proximity. In terms of getting to Hamilton\\'s home I probably would just recommend an uber unless you really want to walk. Its a lot of walking because that is over on the west side and quite a bit north. If you want to use mass transit you could walk along the northern boundary of central park at 110th and keep heading west and then go up (if you walk all the way stay on the street and don\\'t try to cut through Morningside park) or head down to the 97th street transverse that goes through the park to the westside. Just keep heading west and take the 1 train at the 96th street stop up to columbia university. Then you can take that same train line up to hamilton\\'s house and then use it to head back south when done. I wouldn\\'t recommend cutting through the center of Harlem on foot. If you want to cut out some walking there is an M96 crosstown bus you could hop on which would save some time. It runs along 96th street and can take you over to the 1 line from the UES.\\nEdited: 9:45 pm, June 25, 2021 The Alexander Hamilton house isn’t near Columbia. If you are walking from there to Columbia I don’t see the sense in eating by Columbia. There is a statue of Hamilton in front of, wait for it, Hamilton Hall. During my junior year I lived in Livingston now Wallach Hall and the window from my room looked right out on Hamilton. If you want to have lunch by Columbia and have the student experience you could get a giant slice of pizza at Koronet or a much better whole pie at V&T. The other option would be to do the Seinfeld pilgrimage and go to Tom’s Diner. I had many a late night burger there. Plot the places on a map to get a better idea of distances and possible routes\\nBe aware the area around Columbia / Hamilton Grange is much hillier than the rest of Manhattan\\nAdjacent to Columbia consider a visit to https://www.stjohndivine.org/ and the Hungarian Pastry Shop across the street P.S. Uphill west of the Grange is the campus of City College and there is a cluster of restaurants along that stretch of Amsterdam & Broadway If you go to Columbia first you can take the 1 train up to City College and walk downhill through the campus to the Grange https://new.mta.info/map/5256\\nAfterwards you could walk over to see Strivers\\' Row https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Nicholas_Historic_District and then south to 125th St. to see the Apollo Theater https://freetoursbyfoot.com/harlem-walking-tours/ has more info on things to see in Harlem that might be helpful We are thinking now that we will Uber directly from midtown east to Hamilton house, (skip Columbia U) then find a place to eat around Red Rooster area. Is this pretty walkable to get to? Please recommend some places to eat right in Harlem. I am travelling from PA to take a flight from Terminal 4 at JFK on July 4 at 12.30 p.m. The megabus drops me in NY at 6.30 p.m. on July 3. I was thinking of just going to T4 in JFK then itself and spend the rest of my time there. However, as my flight is an international one and is the only flight by that airlines that day, I don\\'t expect them to check me in 4-5 hours prior to the flight. So, with potentially 12 hours to spare, pre-security check, what are my options? You could easily stay in Manhattan for one night, have dinner etc, and head to the airport in the morning, or you could stay at the retro TWA hotel and public spaces in terminal 5 at JFK. Also look around at the displays and views and have something to eat and drink.\\nThe Airtrain will get you between the terminals.\\nLook if they have room availability.\\nhttps://www.twahotel.com/ Depends on you interests and budget\\nYou could stash your luggage at http://schwartztravel.com/ and spend some time wandering, have dinner, etc before heading to JFK\\nThere are (or were pre-covid) a few places landside you could kill time 24/7 at JFK https://www.sleepinginairports.net/guides/new-york-city-jfk-airport-guide.htm There really isn\\'t any point going to JFK that early, you\\'ve got NYC to have fun in for a few hours.\\nI\\'d personally grab a hotel for the night, you don\\'t really need to be at the airport before 9:30am - so set off at 8am on the subway and you\\'ve got plenty of time to do something. I would spring for a hotel for the night. Stay in the city. Drop your bags. Head out and grab dinner. Walk around and enjoy the holiday vibe!\\nThen on the 4th, up early, grab some breakfast somewhere and then head to JFK.\\nIf you just want to get to the airport and relax there, stay at the TWA and see if you can get a reservation at the pool where you can have a drink and watch the planes take off(weather permitting!) My wife and I have been to NYC on vacation a year ago and found some cheap tickets to go back this summer. On our 1st trip we did a lot of the big tourist attractions like Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Natural History museum, Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, and One World Tower. This trip so far we were gonna go to the Met and MoMA, but didn\\'t know what else we should add this time around. Any suggestions on things we should hit for round 2? When are you coming this summer? For how long? I would try to snag tickets to Little Island ASAP. -I might hit up a Chinatown(Sunset Park or Flushing.)\\n-I would check out Grand Central as it comes back alive.\\n-I would check the schedule for Celebrate Brooklyn @ Prospect Park. See if anyone cool is playing during your visit.\\n-Have a drink at a rooftop bar.\\nJust a few more suggestions. Did you go to Brooklyn or Queens? How about Governors Island? Maybe Coney Island? Explore other areas of Central Park, like the North Woods.\\nI agree about Little Island, that couples well with the High Line, Hudson Yards, The Hudson River Greenway, and so on.\\nExplore neighborhoods, so many great self guided walking tours in this site:\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html\\nSo much to see and do, especially in the summer time. In summer I\\'d take a day trip to a beach. Coney Island and Brighton Beach, or the Rockaways, would be good for a day trip.\\nOther high observatories are Top of the Rock, Empire State Building and the newest is The Edge, it has a partial glass floor and is in Hudson Yards which also has The Vessel, a very unusual structure.\\nWalking the High Line is good. You could combine this with Hudson Yards (northern end) and maybe even stop in at Chelsea Market and the Whitney Museum at the southern end. Here are some Second trip Suggestions\\nTHe High Bridge (Not the High Line, but it is similar)\\nNY Botanical Garden\\nBrooklyn Botanical Garden\\nflushing Meadow Park\\nGrand Army Plaza Brooklyn area (Brooklyn Museum, Botanical Garden, Brooklyn Public Library, Prospect Park)\\nA baseball Game\\nGantry State Park in Queens\\nDomino Park in brooklyn\\nRivereside Park\\nFort Tryon and the Cloisters I might check Industry City\\'s calendar:\\nhttps://industrycity.com/events/ Spend time in Greenwich Village, including people watching in Washington Square Park. You mentioned the Statue of Liberty but did you continue onto Ellis Island? If not, I highly recommend the Ellis Island Hard Hat tour. I will be traveling to NYC 7/5-11 with my two teenage daughters. First trip for my daughters, my second trip with the first being more than 20 years ago. We had originally booked the sky view double room (floor 20-36) at the IC in April. We like the IC room with the view and large size (340 sq ft). With more research this week, I am a bit concerned about the safety/homeless if IC being located in Hell\\'s Kitchen and near the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Through Costco travel, I found Sheraton Time Square for the about the same cost (transfer from EWR included) but likely not a room with sky view. I appreciate any advice on choosing between these two hotels, especially safety and convivence for travel to the usual sightseeing sites in Manhattan. I like my daughter\\'s first experience in NYC to be a good one, thank you! The location of the IC is fine. The homeless are more btw. 35th and 42nd.\\nIt\\'s also newer than the Sheraton I think the location of the Sheraton is better anyway, but the hotel is not as new as the IC. There are city views rooms there but they may not be included in the Costco offer. The M Social hotel has just opened (renamed from Novotel) and is offering good opening rates now, especially if you join (for free online) their frequent guest program (Millenium hotels).\\nCheck that price against the others.\\nhttps://www.millenniumhotels.com/en/new-york/m-social-hotel-times-square-new-york/\\nBtw, included transfers are often shared buses which can take a long time, especially if dropping everyone off at different hotels. Don,t feel obligated to take it. I prefer the location of the Sheraton but the rooms and view of the IC. I would pick the Intercontinental. Thanks for the feedback so far. I will check out M Social. The Costco hotel transfer is through MySedan (a private sedan) and includes all fees except gratuity. Make sure that is really a private transfer and not a van taking ten people to five different places. Slowly. Another tourist shot in Times Square AGAIN yesterday. Gaggle it\\nCrime is WAY UP\\nPolicing WAY DOWN\\nStay away for you and your families safety. I\\'ve stayed at the IC and it is a nice hotel in a good location. The rooms have great views. It is not that close to the Port Authority. The name Hell\\'s Kitchen misleads some people. It is not a dangerous area.

We are a couple heading to NYC for 2 nights in July to celebrate a birthday.\\nLooking for hotel recommendations (currently looking at 1 Hotel Central Park) but definitely open to other ideas. Given it’s a celebration and short visit we aren’t looking to skimp on a hotel cost but also like something with a bit of fun/personality as well.\\nDaily plan includes exploring the city by foot, shopping and perhaps walking through Central Park before a nice dinner out.\\nWould also be interested in hearing recommendations for a celebratory birthday dinner for our last night in the city.\\nThanks everyone! To get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station (OR if driving and need parking directions of travel) and 4) hotel budget.\\nFor dining suggestions some idea about your preferences for cuisine, atmosphere and budget will get better feedback If you mean the hotel called 1 Central Park, I think it\\'s a nice idea. Just be aware most if not all of their rooms don\\'t have very private showers/bathrooms. Look at the photos carefully. Here,s a link to a website that specializes in chic boutique hotels. Not necessarily suggesting you book with them (although sometimes they do get great deals) but it\\'s a good list.\\nhttps://www.mrandmrssmith.com/destinations/new-york-state/new-york/hotels?utm_content=non-brand&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI86LqzIr58AIVc8yzCh3hdwsZEAAYAyAAEgLkffD_BwE Marea is sort of near the hotel, if you like seafood, fish (Italian flavors). Went to Tao for a family member\\'s birthday and it was a good time but it really depends on what cuisine/atmosphere you\\'re looking for. since you want to explore the city by foot, I\\'d recommend the gesso app for free walking tours that you can take whenever fits your schedule. You might also look into the New York Edition for your hotel. Lovely hotel and a really pretty setting right on Madison Square Park. Easy subway access up to Central Park if that\\'s your favourite location, and downtown for other sights. Lots of places to eat nearby in the Flatiron and NoMad areas.\\nhttps://www.editionhotels.com/new-york/\\nBut if you really like the 1 Central Park, go for it.\\nAnother one of their hotels is 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge. That one has amazing views of Manhattan, but it\\'s further to get to Manhattan sights for sightseeing if that\\'s your aim.\\nOthers that might appeal are the Whitby Hotel, The Equinox and Park Terrace.\\nhttps://www.firmdalehotels.com/hotels/new-york/the-whitby-hotel/\\nhttps://equinox-hotels.com/nyc/\\nhttps://parkterracehotel.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_YO7nsTA8QIV9MEWBR1MjAB6EAAYASAAEgKRgfD_BwE\\nMarea is good for a celbratory dinner if you like Italian Seafood. I was also going to suggest Le Coucou for French food (gorgeous restaurant) but it\\'s closed.

So to start with the major ones. It seems MA, NH and VT might be too far fetched? CT and PA might be more feasible?\\nOpen to hear any suggestions!\\nEdited: 9:52 am, June 17, 2021 Check out Metro North getaways. There are several \"trips\" that you ca take around the 4th. Then look into the towns that are suggested for what is happening for the 4th. Have you looked into travel options? Some of the places you list are not in practical day trip distance\\nPhiladelphia via Amtrak\\nIn CT perhaps New Haven by Metro North commuter train\\nMany places would require going by bus and have limited options for getting around without a car once there Would Upstate NY work? The MetroNorth options are great and easy, but it isn\\'t a neighboring state. Philadelphia by Amtrak is probably your best bet. Check on their holiday schedule to see what train service is like that day. It\\'s only about an hour and 20 minutes between NY and Philly. Easy to do as a day trip. Just be aware that 30th Street Station is about 2 miles from the historic district (i.e. Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Museum of the American Revolution, etc. ) You can take the Market St. subway line easily to that area. I would agree that Philadelphia is likely the most interesting place to visit for a reasonable day trip.\\nEdited: 10:49 am, June 17, 2021 I don\\'t know what you mean by a “ signature spot.” If you don\\'t want another city, some place in Connecticut makes most sense to me. While New Haven has Yale University with some great museums, they will likely be closed on the 4th. What is it you\\'d like to do on this daytrip? @ter1413: Ok let me check\\n@Kaye_in_Astoria: Philadelphia and New Haven are possible to get around without a car? Which one is your preference?\\n@Northern_Traveler00: my main goal is to hit a state I have never been before so it is like a milestone or crossed xxx off life to do list!\\n@jtwiz and @Fox11354: Yeah that is an option. What about somewhere in CT?\\nThank you! I checked the metronorth page and didn\\'t find the getaway ideas... @nywhiz: I am not a fan of museums. I guess just go to the popular areas and feel it. Get a feel of the whole city/town overall. First time is like a teaser I just want to sample it. If really like the place you can always go back and explore more Go to Mystic , CT . You can get there via Amtrack, there is somewhat limited Service to Mystic, so you go to New London and take an Uber to Mystic Passing through NYC we need to visit family near Times Square. Our truck will have kayaks on top making it the height of a small rv - 10 ft tall. What hotels have parking tall enough for us to fit in? Any recommendations for which hotels? Thanks in advance None you will need to park this outside of the city Maybe none. Very few NYC hotels have their own parking garage. The only 2 I know of near Times Square are the Marriott Marquis and the Travel Inn. There may be some options for you on the NJ side and you could ferry into Manhattan. Check the Sheraton Lincoln Harbor and the hotels in Weehawken, NJ and Edgewater, NJ. The NJ hotels I think have open parking. If you have a camper there is the Liberty RV park in Jersey City (Right Across the river by a path Station)\\nthat might work for you Maybe street parking? There are some open air lots in lower Manhattan that I have seen I am visiting in a couple of weeks and am staying in Chinatown. Are there any really good tea/coffee/breakfast places I should try while I am there? Particularly places that open on the early side since I don\\'t sleep late when I travel (early being 8-9 AM). Thanks for your help! These may be more or less convenient depending on exactly where you\\'re staying in Chinatown. Some are in Chinatown and some in nearby areas. Check their opening hours, I haven\\'t really kept up with what\\'s happened with those during the pandemic.\\nTwo Bridges Diner\\nMaman Tribeca\\nRuss & Daughters (Lower East Side)\\nMama Eatery\\nIf you want to splurge a little and travel a little bit further: Balthazar. An institution French bistro type place in Soho. I\\'m following Keith Mcnally and IIRC they\\'ve reopened for breakfast as well. Also, if you perform some searches on various food sites yourself do look into places in Tribeca, Soho and Lower East Side as well as Chinatown \"proper\". Depending on where you are, starting from some places in the neighboring areas might be within fairly short, easy walking distance from your hotel. Why not having the real chinatown experience and try golden unicorn or Jingfong.\\nDefinitely an experience ad good dumplings/dim sum Mee Lai Wah Coffee Shop on Bayard Street. Place has been there forever! Best freshly baked buns with bean filling and pork and shrimp dumplings. And the absolute best cup of coffee in all New York City! Or 46 Mott bakery - the owner is an activist and advocate for the Manhattan Chinatown community, kind of a local hero. Even if it doesn’t fit your breakfast needs (their Yelp listing says they don’t open til 10am), maybe stop by for a snack or treat? Landmark Diner on Grand St is pretty close to Chinatown. Old school diner, just checked and glad to see it’s still going. The Chinatown bakeries are open that early and I tend to get my take out dim sum early in the morning on the weekdays. You can get a bun and coffee in the morning. Welcome to Chinatown has a cool directory with info on a lot of local businesses in the area: https://www.welcometochinatown.com/#directory I am traveling to Pittsburgh with my wife and two small kids to meet a friend and from there we(along with my friend and his family) are planning to go to Manhattan for 4 days. We are traveling with car so that on the way we can stop and see Philly and DC, we were planning to stay in Edison, NJ and travel to Penn statin using PATH route but I think it would be very hectic in terms of travel from NJ to Manhattan. Now I am thinking to park car in a parking lot in NJ and stay in Manhattan for 4 days.\\nWould you guys recommend to stay in NJ or should I park cars in a lot somewhere near to train station and then stay in Manhattan. Also can you guys please recommend some safe parking lot for parking for 4 nights. Staying in Manhattan is easier, if possible and budget allows it. Even more so with small children imo, but I would recommend that anyhow. It\\'ll be easier to get back to the hotel to rest for a bit if needed. I am still working on my plan. New plan that I am doing little research on is drive to Jersey City and park car in Journal Square garage which is near to PATH station, do reservations in Holiday Inn(currently asking $119/night) in Wall Street area, take train to hotel and take car from garage on the way back to Pittsburgh. Driving and parking by the PATH is just as bad if not worse than driving and parking in Manhattan and getting there often involves more city driving than getting to a garage in Manhattan right outside of the Tunnel. The train service from Edison, NJ, would be New Jersey Transit to Penn Station, Manhattan. The PATH line ends at Penn Station Newark, NJ. NJT from Edison Station runs about every half hour to Manhattan and costs $26.50 per adult round trip. The trip is around an hour. Look at Jersey City for hotels. Easier and cheaper to hop in and out of Manhattan. Train and ferry boats I think your plan is overly ambitious with little kids, especially in the hot summer. I\\'d skip DC and stick to Phil. and NYC. Edison, NJ is not convenient for a NYC Vist. Staying in Manhattan makes most sense. You might check one of the parking websites like\\nSpothero.com\\nBestparking.com\\nIconparking.com\\nAnd See what the cost would be to park near a hotel in Manhattan.\\nI don\\'t think staying in Jersey City makes any sense. Al the hotels near a PATH train charge for parking and the prices are not likely to be much cheaper than staying in Manhattan.\\nEdited: 3:33 pm, June 30, 2021 Early 20s female, going on a solo business trip to NYC but have 2 additional days during the weekend to myself to sightsee. Never been to NYC before. I like culture, history & food- not big on shopping. I\\'m thinking of the following itinerary:\\nDay 1: lower manhatten; battery park, statue of liberty, wall street & charging bull, world trade center & oculus\\nDay 2: mid manhatten: times square, central park, empire state builidng, metropolitan museum of arts\\nHow is this itinerary?\\nCouple questions:\\n1. is it worth going to liberty/ellis island or should I just take the staten island ferry and see the statue of liberty from there?\\n2. Is going to the 9/11 museum worth it or should I just see the memorial? Between going on to liberty/ellis island and the 9/11 museum, which would you recommend?\\n3. How is the itinerary overall? Anything I should take out/add?\\n4. Any food recommendations in manhatten? I like italian, pizza, middle eastern food. and dessert :) In general, your plans are fine...great survey of well known sites.\\nQuestions 1 and 2: I have no idea what is \"worth it\" to YOU. Are you concerned about the time involved to go to SOL/Ellis Island and the time to go to the 9/11 Museum? Or the cost of the tickets? Some people love being inside the SOL, some love being so close up on the island. And Ellis Island is incredibly interesting. As for the museum, I live less than a 10 minute walk from it but have never gone - I still carry the trauma of the actual day and really have no interest in re-living that trauma. However, the entrance to the One World Observatory, and the path you walk gives you some of the experience of what happened, and the elevator ride is amazing (as are the views).\\nQuestion 3: Itinerary is a \"greatest hits\" list. But you could spend a month, or a lifetime in NYC - even just Manhattan - and not see it all. So, it\\'s impossible to answer \"anything I should take out/add\" without knowing what you are interested in. Museums? Nature/parks? Interesting neighborhoods? Personally, I don\\'t think a visit to Manhattan is complete without walking around Greenwich Village and SoHo, but that\\'s me. What are your interests? You should also look at the Metropolitan Museum of Art website, there is SO much to see, you will want to figure out where you want to go, you could easily spend a week there and not see it all (I would budget 2-3 hours.) I would also try to go to MoMA too.\\nQuestion 4: Depending on whose count you go by, there are probably 8,000-10,000 establishments that classify as \"restaurants\". You can get a falafel at a food truck for $5.00, or you can go to a fabulous sit-down Middle Eastern restaurant like Nur or Balaboosta and spend 10-20 times that. You need to give budget in dollars (something like \"not too expensive\" means very different things to different people), neighborhood (if that\\'s important), lunch or dinner, whether alcohol is important, etc. Vague questions are really hard to answer, the more details you provide, the better your responses will be. When we visited NYC we were not intending to visit Ellis Island & SOL, we changed our minds and were so glad we did Ellis Island is wonderful you can feel the history in the building my daughter loves history and was so glad we decided to visit.\\nSOL for us was good for a little walk round and a few pictures,\\nThe views from the island over to Lower Manhattan are breathtaking.\\nWe did visit One World Observatory it’s fabulous the views are amazing.\\nFor us the 9/11 memorial was enough, reading the names seeing the rose placed on a name because it’s that persons birthday was very emotional. Being at the memorials paying our respects remembering That Day was\\nenough for us.\\nI would choose SOL/ Ellis Island and paying your respects at the memorials.\\nEnjoy your 2 days you have such a lot to see & do. When is this trip?\\nThe interior of the SOL is still closed https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm IMO the SOL/Ellis Island are interesting - but it will require several hours, so depends on your interest level. The 9/11 Museum also needs a couple of hours and is emotionally intense . The Memorial / Oculus area is worthwhile\\nHere\\'s a map of downtown that might be helpful https://downtownny.com/explore/plan-your-trip/must-see-downtown/ On Day 1: don\\'t forget to visit the Fearless Girl\\nAs for your questions:\\n1. Personally I saw the Statue of Liberty from a sunset cruise, I highly recommend it\\n2. I went to the 9/11 Museum and it was heart wrenching, it took hours (if not days) to get over the feeling\\n3. I would reorganize the order of Day 2: Empire State Building, Metropolitain Museum of Arts, Central Park and end in Times Square\\n4. Food is hard to recommend, it depends on how much you are willing to pay and be careful, drinks are very expensive in New York The Met Museum of Art is not open every day and your schedule would determine if you could go there or not. Please read the Plan your visit section of their website:\\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit I\\'m with you Risa. As someone who was there on 9/11, I have no interest in ever going to the museum. Too many painful memories that I don\\'t enjoy have dredged up. Too many people I know who died. Hard to believe its almost 20 years. The first year when the moment of silence was held, the whole street stopped. Everyone phone on the trading floor went silent. In 2019, I don\\'t think there was even a pause. But then again most of the people on the desk weren\\'t here then. I\\'m such a dinosaur. Yes, Sloppy! I wasn\\'t there, but my day is a long, involved story of \"only in NYC.\" At one point, I was stuck in my car for ...I don\\'t know how long - time wasn\\'t relevant, scared, alone, cell phone service interrupted, and freaking out....when I pass that spot, my heart starts to pound and I have the feelings that I\\'m about to hyperventilate, even almost 20 years later (damn now my heart is pounding again). Fortunately, it passes after I move from the spot. Nope, not going to the museum.\\nAnd I agree, it\\'s super strange to see people just going about their day on that day - including me (but I do something every year to remember).\\nEdited: 11:28 am, June 29, 2021 1. Yes.\\n2. Museum? Yes.\\nOn this trip, I would probably skip both. Skip may be the wrong word, but I would postpone visiting both until your next visit.\\nI know that you will have free time during the wknd, but I agree knowing when would help out. You can see a free concert in Central Park or bump into the C Park skaters on the wknd in the summer. The park is different in the summer.\\nFood is one thing that you won\\'t have to worry about. You can check out Smorgasburg, Essex St Market, Time Out Market, etc. to find different options under 1 roof. I would say additional items on the itinerary depend on what you have time for. I\\'ve taken the ferry and also visited ellis island a while back and that involved spending a bit more time there walking around.\\nWhen you\\'re in Midtown my friend recently told me about this audio walking tour through Rockefeller Center which could be cool since this is your first time in NY and especially if you\\'re interested in art/culture/history, this is the link: https://www.rockefellercenter.com/audio-tour/ (some of the local restaurant owners are featured on the tour, so could inspire your meal choices!) think both SOL and Ellis Island is interesting to see. But with only 2 days unless it is something you always wanted to see I would use the time to see more inter Manhattan more so.\\nAlso the MET appears to be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday\\'s now. I want to take my niece for a truly authentic Chinese experience outside of Manhattan Chinatown, and I was at this mall a few years ago and I think it\\'s perfect. I know they closed down due to Covid but I cannot find if they have since re-opened, and if so, how much is actually re-opened. I did see people going in the doors from Roosevelt Ave., but I do not know what is going in inside. I usually avoid the place as it is so crowded and the nicer restaurants upstairs do not have menus in English. I think just walking around in Flushing (or Sunset Park, Brooklyn) would give you the experience you’re looking for. There are certainly lively streets and plenty of places to eat in both.\\nOne thing I’ve noticed in Sunset Park Chinatown (and I know from Fox’s posts is the same in Flushing) is that even as much of the city doffs their masks outside, mask-wearing is still ubiquitous there. So just follow the lead of the community when visiting. It\\'s open. The supermarket and all the shops on the first floor are open. Most (not all) of the vendors in the food court are open and I think you can sit there, although I usually take things to go. I haven\\'t been to the upper floors but I assume the shops & restaurants are open. It\\'s open. The last time I was there I was able to eat a socially distant meal. I see today that WHO has recommended that all persons wear masks indoors even if vaccinated. LA is now pushing this as well for fear of the delta variant of Covie-19. It is going to be very difficult to get people to wear masks after having given them up. Perhaps I am fortunate in that regard to live in Flushing. Last time I was in a mall in flushing was….Busy Bee.\\nAnyone remember this? It\\'s not your Grandma\\'s veggie side dishes:\\nhttps://www.grubstreet.com/2021/06/a-vegan-and-a-critic-on-eleven-madison-parks-all-plant-menu.html Ugh, I\\'ve reached my limit on articles (without being a subscriber) so I can\\'t read it. Too bad, I\\'m sort of curious about how the new approach is being received. I won\\'t be going. It sounds like you leave very much entertained, and I\\'m sure it\\'s a sublime experience, but not entirely satisfied.\\nI was at a top restaurant in DC recently...the same kind of over the top experience. Since I don\\'t eat meat (but eat fish, but generally, not shellfish), they gave me and the other person a vegetarian (not vegan) series of dishes, while the other two people had all kinds of other things. (I suspect they simply didn\\'t have other fish on hand - it\\'s a chef\\'s tasting menu).\\nThe food was a vision to behold, each course made you wonder how they created such delightful presentations, just gorgeous. And it was all delicious, undoubtedly (I wasn\\'t taking notes and I was drinking quite a bit, so I can\\'t go into the distinctions of the umami characters like this review). But I wasn\\'t fully satisfied at the end of the meal (if they hadn\\'t brought about 6 or 7 desserts for the four of us, I may even have been hungry after). I missed something more substantive, frankly. We had an incredible night of celebration, and the service was exquisite, including the chef coming out and signing my menu and posing for photos. I loved the experience. However, that experience of feeling slightly in need of another protein, together with this review, means I will not be shelling out $350pp plus alcohol, regardless of how elaborate and visionary it is.\\nI know my food lane... I don\\'t need to race there. UNLESS someone else is taking me, and lets me choose the wine. (the wine and grappa we had made me VERY happy,) Then, I will write my own review! Took a look at the menu and just don\\'t see the value in shelling out money for this. Many other places I\\'d rather go to if I am going to spend that much on a meal. That review about EMP was so fun to read .... mmmmm umami! Thanks for posting this. I already didn\\'t care for its previous incarnation with multiple tasting courses - not my choice for how to have dinner, but this seems really unappealing to me. I\\'m usually put off by theatricality, and this wouldn\\'t be an exception.\\nOnly the tomato \"tea\" and the process to create that intrigued me. A lot of the description reminded me of various high level dining that was too much like a science project or \"molecular\" cuisine by chef Sean Brock in Charleston, or a famous French restaurant in Montreal which was just a little too cute in the presentation of the food - tiny miniature wooden clothespins holding tidbits of prosciutto to a clothesline, something smoked under glass with actual smoke under a glass dome, and something involving cotton candy for dessert. It was memorable for all the wrong reasons.\\nCharleston chefs tend to take their vegetables very seriously, and I could see some courses similar to these incorporated in menus there.\\nEdited: 11:32 am, June 30, 2021 Hi,\\nI\\'ve been to NYC a couple of times, but I still need advice on how to do this. My family will be visiting my son in Rhode Island for a few days, and we (6 adults) plan to visit NYC for one day. We are coming in on Amtrak and will arrive at the new Penn Station (I forgot the name of the new one...it\\'s across the street from Penn). We arrive at about 10:20 AM and then depart about 7:50 PM. I know this isn\\'t much time, and that\\'s fine. We just wanted a day trip. All of us have been there at least a couple of times except for my daughter in law. She has never been. We want her to at least get to see NYC while we are in the area. (We live in the deep South.)\\nWe plan to split up and each couple do their own thing since we have such little time. A must do is briefly see the location of an apartment in upper Manhattan (one son is about to move to NYC and that\\'s where he will be living. We just want to see where he will be.) We\\'d also like to see the location of the Calhoun School as that is where he will be teaching. Then, my husband and I would like to either visit the Top of the Rock and ride the Staten Island Ferry or possibly do Ellis Island and skip Top of the Rock (probably?? I don\\'t figure there will be enough time to do both??) Would there also be time to spend a little bit of time in Central Park? Any words of advice on any of this? Any advice about the order we should try to do some of these things would be great.\\nAlso what about the subways? I am hearing there has been a lot of crime there recently. Would you feel safe riding?\\nJust any advice would be great. Thanks! Upper Manhattan is very broad. , Need more information, I checked the Calhoun School its kind of out of the way of everything, as this apartment could be\\nMoynaham Hall train IS Penn Station.\\nI would do the following\\nTimes Square and walk to Top of the Rock then walk to Central Park, then Take Subway down to Staten Island Ferry. This is doable, you can see the basics Consider booking some of the group on\\nhttps://www.smallbustoursnyc.com/\\nit would make life simple. Or maybe hire them to do a private tour for your group.\\nFor you, the Calhoun a school is easy to reach by subway from Penn station. Start using google maps so you can see what,s near what.\\nMaps.google.com\\nYou just type the name of a place like\\nPenn station nyc\\nand then type another place like\\nCalhoun School nyc\\nand click directions. You can see the distance, how to go by subway (train icon) or how long it would take to walk( person icon) The school, is near Central Park and Riverside Park. It would be easy to get to Top of the Rock from there. You\\'d probably have time for the Staten Island ferry but it\\'s all the way downtown.\\nEdited: 10:46 pm, June 28, 2021 You can spend an hour in Central Park, you can spend the whole day....I agree with Whiz, from Moynihan Station (named after the much-loved Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan) or, depending on where you get out of your train, you may find that you are IN Penn Station (it\\'s across the street from Moynihan, but connected underground) follow the signs to the subway - you want the 2 or 3 UPTOWN, one stop to 72nd Street. You can walk from there to Calhoun. Then walk to Central Park. You can enter the Park across the Street from the Dakota on 72nd St (where John Lennon lived, north east corner of 72nd and Central Park West), cross the street and enter the Park, which is right near Strawberry Fields, walk through that section of Central Park, wander around to see what else you want to see (you can look at a map of the Park or look at the website)...then subway down to the Staten Island Ferry, go back and forth, maybe walk through Battery Park, maybe, maybe, maybe you have time to go see the 9/11 Memorial...then subway back up to Times Square, walk from there to Top of the Rock, depending on when this trip is, you may catch the sunset at TOTR, a more expensive ticket but most think it\\'s worth it, and then leave in time to get back to your train. You can do it! Subway is safe\\nEllis island you have to also do Statue of Liberty and get tix in advance. It is a multi hour experience.\\nYour plans are doable, but planning is needed You need timed tickets for the SOL/Ellis. https://www.cityexperiences.com/new-york/city-cruises/statue/\\nYou can choose not to get off the ferry at Liberty Island and go directly to Ellis. There is an airline style security screening at Battery Park before boarding. Ticket times are for the security line not a particular ferry\\nI doubt if you have time to go to Ellis You also don\\'t say where the apartment location is in relation to the school\\nHow far north (?) it is is another variable. I agree with Howard walk to Times Square, but to save more time you could take a speed boat to lady Liberty\\nhttps://www.thebeastnyc.com/\\nThen go to TOTR, have late lunch at Central Park Boat House. Then see the school and apartment .\\nEdited: 6:46 pm, June 29, 2021 I hope you and your family are part of the 29.7% of the Mississippi population that has been vaccinated against COVID. New York has travelers from all over, probably including some carrying the highly transmissible Delta variant of COVID, making travel here (or anywhere for that matter) risky for the unvaccinated. Yes, we are fully vaccinated. Thanks for responding, luv. Nice to confirm that visitors are just as concerned and taking the same steps we are. #ScienceRocks i will be in NYC and need a rapid covid test to return to the UK\\nit needs to be a supervised test and for the results to be provided in proper form so i can present it for travel\\nhow much does such a test cost ?\\ni know there are free city testing centres like at times square - do they provide documentation of results ? Is Uber cheaper than a taxi cab in NYC?\\nThx in advance. Same.\\nUse the subway if you are basically going from A to B. Frequently, but not always - e.g., to JFK ( where taxis have a fixed rate), during surge pricing, if you choose uber black... The cost difference varies. Taxi is typically better for short distances and if Uber has surge pricing. Uber is typically cheaper on the longer trips. you can punch your destination into the uber app and get an estimate. There has been alot of Surge pricing with Uber as of late The investors in Uber had been subsidizing costs to encourage people to develop an Uber habit. The subsidies have ended and prices have skyrocketed. Lyft is a little less expensive than Uber. Taxis are often less expensive than Uber now. Last Tuesday, I was on the Uber app and my ride would have been $34. I took a cab - it was $13.00 on the meter. I was just in NYC last week. My friend and I used taxis and Uber. Uber was most definitely more costly for getting around the city. Another thing I found interesting unlike visits in the past there was not a abundance of taxis to be found around the city. Costs are up because there is a driver shortage and taxi shortage. Higher demand causes prices to go up, Once the expanded unemployment insurance runs out and we are through the tourist season in the fall and taxi companies puts more of their taxis back on the road there will likely be more car services on the road and prices are expected to come down. Bets thing to do is to not make assumptions and simply check the uber app for a price assessment. What the situation is today is not necessarily what it will be several weeks from now.\\nEdited: 9:08 pm, June 29, 2021 Subway is faster and cheaper than either.\\nEdited: 1:43 am, June 30, 2021 Thanks for answering and have a great day. My husband and I are planning to visit New York city this early October. Below is what we have so far, any suggestions and input will be greatly appreciated!\\nDay 1 Arrive around 1 pm\\nChinatown, New York, NY\\nBrooklyn Bridge & Brooklyn heights promenade\\nDay 2\\nStatue of Liberty and Ellis Island\\nThe Battery park\\nCharging Bull\\nTrinity Church, 89 Broadway, New York, NY 10006\\nSt. Paul\\'s Chapel, 209 Broadway, New York, NY 10007\\nWorld Trade Center, New York, NY\\nDay 3\\nThe Metropolitan Museum\\nCentral park\\nFifth Avenue\\nSt. Patrick\\'s Cathedral, 5th Ave, New York, NY 10022\\nThe New York Public Library\\nEmpire State Building\\nTimes Square\\nWatch Broadway show in the evening\\nDay 4 Pick up a rental car and departure. If needed, we\\'ll leave after lunch.\\nDay 5 New Hampshire\\nDay 6 Arrive Acadia\\nDay 7-8 Acadia National Park\\nDay 9 to Boston ( Have visited Boston. Drive to here for direct flight)\\nDay 10 Fly back to home\\nHigh line looks interesting, but I couldn\\'t figure out which day to do it and how to access to it. Please let me know if I missed anything which I probably would enjoy or I should re-order the places we are planning to visit. Thank you! You can never do everything so dont even try. Just pick what interests you most. What area will you be staying? On day 1 I am guessing you plan on walking across Brooklyn Bridge? You could also grab a bite to eat in DUMBO if you wish on day 1.\\nI don\\'t know what WTC means. You mean visiting the memorial or are you intending to do the 9/11 museum? If you are not doing the 9/11 museum you may be able to add some other stuff to this day.\\nSince you will only be a block away on day 2 I would add in the stock exchange and federal hall for photo opportunities.\\nDay 3 is quite jam packed. Times square should be done at night to see it lit up. During the day I wouldn\\'t burn time there. The two big items on this day will be the MET and central park. Keep in mind how weather can impact your plans e.g, if its raining you will want to shift the park day. Part of this depends on what you mean when you say you want to see Central Parl. Like are you just going to say you have been there and for a quick walk or are you looking to explore it in more depth which takes much longer.\\nIf you are staying in the midtown area you can hit some of the places on your day 3 list on the other days whenever you have free time. Where Highline can fits in again depends on what neighborhood you are staying in. The closest item on your list to the highline would be the empire state building. You could walk from the empire state building west down 34th street (also note that koreatown is around the corner from the empire state building on 32nd street. Going back to 34th street if you walk down to the corner you will be at herald square where Macys is. If you keep heading west and head a block or two south you will be at the Hudson Yards, you will be able to see the vessel and then you could connect up to the high line over there and head south. You could walk down the high line and stop off at chelsea markets.\\nIf staying in midtown then maybe on day 2 you do the statue of liberty etc first thing in the morning early then financial district, work your way over to WTC, hop the E train up to Chelsea, check out chelsea markets then walk the highline north up to hudson yards, vessel then head east see macys, hearld square, visit ESB (will likely be late afternoon, early evening by this point), but you would be finishing in midtown. Would be a very long day with lots of walking. You have too much for day 3. You need alot of time for the Met and Central Park easily half a day or more for either.\\nI was at Acadia National Park last summer, Its 7.5 Hours from NYC to get there and realistically you need 3 days there, It might be worse this summer as Ive heard the crowds are really bad (Last summer people from NY and NJ were allowed to go , but not people from Mass so it was pretty empty). ive heard passes were very hard to get. Its about 4- hours from Acadia to Boston If you leave after lunch for new Hampshire just understand you won\\'t get there until night time. Not sure what you plan to do in New Hampshire but I would probably consider just turning it into a place to sleep over and then head straight to arcadia the next morning to maximize your time there. For thw most part. there is no need to list Times Square & Broadway as separate as Times Square is the heart of the Theater District. I am guessing OP is staying in Portsmouth, NH. Its about the half-way point between NYC and Bar Harbor Sorry had a typo I meant Acadia The easiest way to the Highline is after the empire State Building either walk about 20 Mins West down 34th St to the High Line (You have to walk from 5th Ave to 12th ave.., you can take a taxi or a bus if you dont want to walk) The other possibility is from Times square take the 7 train one Stop to Hudson Yards and the High Line is there (Its about 2 block walk to the entrance from the Subway Station) Thanks everyone for your time and help! 😊😊😊\\nred259, I haven\\'t booked a hotel yet. You are right - I plan on walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. I\\'ll check out the DUMBO .\\nI have added stock exchange and federal hall to Day 2. Removed WTC.\\nGood to know time square should be seen in the night. I have made a note of it. When I go to see Empire state building, I will try Highline. Central park is rated high in TripAdvisor, I feel like I should see it. I suspect it is just like other good city parks I have visited with flowers, fountains, statues. So far I plan on a quick walk through.\\nGood point to check on the weather and shift museum day.👍👍👍\\nYou mentioned midtown in your post, looks like I should book a hotel in that area.\\nThank you for your suggestion on the itinerary! I\\'ll put these into google maps later.\\nhowardform: Thanks for the information you have provided! I checked Acadia national park website, it says vehicle reservation is required for Cadillac road. I\\'ll make sure to make the reservation early.\\nThanks for the suggestion on how to get to Highline!\\nblumebwaybaby: Good to know that time square is in the heart of theater district.\\nI plan on visiting New York in early October, so when driving to Acadia, I can enjoy some fall colors along the way. I\\'ll try to get there early, give Acadia more time. I don\\'t know where I am going to stay in NH yet.\\nThanks again everyone for your help!!😊😊😊 I plan on taking Uber or Taxi if needed transportation, it will save us some time and trouble finding bus or subway stations.. Is it a good idea? So fun to be back in NYC, first time since January 2020! We stayed at the Renaissance Midtown, part of the Marriott portfolio. It\\'s a go-to for us, as we always arrive via NJ Transit at Penn Station and this hotel is literally a 5-minute walk. Arriving early afternoon on Friday, our room was ready (yea!) We unpacked our bags and headed out.\\nWe walked the High Line down to Chelsea Market. I bought a few gourmet goodies and then we split a huge slice at Filago. Onto our timed ticket reservation at Little Island! We spent about an hour there, including a stop for wine, beer at the kiosks. We really enjoyed the views, the plantings, the salsa band playing in the amphitheater, the kids doing the inter-active displays, etc. The views across the Hudson were fantastic!\\nFrom there we went to the Brass Monkey Rooftop bar for Happy Hour. Great service, fun people. We will be back. Our next stop was dinner at Dos Caminos (Meatpacking District), where we had a reservation. Good food ( While our meal was fine, I think I need to look for a better Mexican place in that part of town) and service.\\nWe leisurely walked back to Midtown, along the Hudson River. It was a beautiful night. We stopped in for a nightcap at an old favorite of ours, The Twins on 9th Ave. And finally called it a day.\\nSaturday had us up early, and really hungry! We ended up going to the Tick Tock Diner on 8th Ave. for breakfast. I have mixed feelings. My Omelet special was great: turkey sausage, fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese. And boy, the hash browns were great. Unfortunately my husband\\'s poached eggs on his Eggs Benedict were overcooked, although he loved the Hollandaise sauce.\\nOff to the Chelsea Flea Market on 25th st. and then the Union Square Farmer\\'s Market, where we bought quite a few things - doing our part for the local economy! Hours later, we wandered through the Village. Checking out some streets, shops, etc. - some new, some that we enjoyed from before. We stopped to watch European soccer at the Red Lion, an old haunt of ours. So many nice people there, old, young, working, drinking. Always a good time.\\nAfter some more meandering through a lot of back streets, we headed to Tavern on Jane for an early pub dinner. Great food, service and nice people around us as a plus. Heading back to Midtown, we saw the sun starting to drop and decided our day was done. But wait, okay, one drink at our hotel bar, Versa!\\nAt that point, we called it quits, back to our beautiful skyline view of the city - so pretty with everything lit up. This morning, we caught an early train back to the Shore - it was too nice out to mill around.\\nBottom line? So darn happy to be back in NYC. No theatre, no concert, or sporting event. But we just soaked up the local vibe and had a blast. May I add, it is my birthday and this was exactly the celebration I was looking for! Thanks NYC, see you soon.... Great report- thanks for sharing, It must feel great to be back there. Welcome back and happy birthday! Wonderful! Happy birthday🎉🥂 and thanks for taking the time to share your visit.\\nPS what about Andrew\\'s Coffee Shop for breakfast near that hotel? Hoq fun. Thanks for your trip report. Thanks for everyone\\'s kind words, it was SO nice to be back in town.\\nNYWhiz, thanks for the recommendation for Andrew\\'s. Will check it out next time! Happy to read your great report! Happy birthday! Sounds like a great trip! Happy Birthday! I wish I lived within a train ride of the city! I really enjoyed your trip report and am a little jealous that you were able to celebrate your birthday in my favorite city.\\nHappy Birthday ! We are travelling to NYC for Christmas with our children. It will be difficult to juggle buying all of our present. I was wondering if there are personal shoppers who could help with buying gifts and have them delivered to our hotel? Grateful for recommendations You can check out Task Rabbit and find someone to do it for you - they would charge by the hour: https://www.taskrabbit.com\\nStores, like Saks Fifth Avenue, have personal shoppers, but while the service is free, it\\'s assumed you\\'re spending big dollars... worth calling and asking. (I don\\'t know if Macy\\'s has a service that would be less costly).\\nThere are stylists and services, but I don\\'t have personal experience with any, google would be your friend here. I\\'ll offer a \"budget minded\" option,\\nIt would require a bit of timing on your part - and the need to confirm willingness with your hotel - but you could just order items from Amazon and have them delivered to you c/o your hotel (or to an Amazon Locker nearby).\\nI\\'ve done a variation of this several times while travelling (e.g., lost my laptop charger - ordered one from Amazon and had it delivered to my destination hotel). In my experience - hotels have been willing.\\nAnd - if you\\'re arriving multiple days before Christmas - the timing gets easier (i.e., you have a bigger time window for when the package(s) can arrive without the hotel having to store them too long - or at all). I did the same as RayR, I\\'ve bought items from different stores that would not deliver to Canada and have it delivered to the hotel. I only cost me a tip to the baggage person who retrieved my item from the back when I arrived. Also, as far as stores like Saks and Bloomingdale\\'s are concerned, everything the personal shopper helps you select is going to have to be purchased in that store and at that store\\'s prices. If you want access to competitive prices and more selection (whether in a brick & mortar store or online) I suggest you look into hiring some sort of independent personal shopper (and it probably won\\'t be cheap). Maybe you could find someone on TaskRabbit to do that, maybe not. Personally, I associate TaskRabbit more with getting someone to run a simple errand, to go pick up something you have already selected, and even if there were someone there willing to help me with the selecting, am not sure I would trust someone on that site, but I have limited experience with TaskRabbit, so you might want to look into that, but suggest you be careful and ask for references.\\nEdited: 6:31 pm, June 29, 2021 My husband and I are taking our niece (21) and nephew (18) for their first visit to NYC. We have been several times in the past, but it\\'s been close to 15+ years now. It will be a short trip Aug 7-10. I\\'ve reserved rooms at M Social Hotel Times Square mainly for the central location and finding a super deal.\\nThis is my rough itinerary by day. I want them to see some of the main sights, but leave flexibility for just wandering and discovering. Sights aren\\'t in a strict order, just organized by day. We will arrive at LGA on Sat the 7th around 3pm and depart Tues the 10th at 5:30pm.\\nWe plan to walk and take the subway as much as possible. I would appreciate any suggestions regarding our plans and advice for best way to travel from The Battery or Wall Street area to Brooklyn Promenade (train or ferry). We are adventurous eaters and always love restaurant recommendations. Thanks in advance for your help.\\nSaturday:\\nArrive LGA and check into hotel\\nSt Patrick’s Cathedral\\nRockefeller Center\\nTop of the Rock\\nWalk past Radio City Music Hall\\nTimes Square in the PM\\nSunday:\\nAmerican Museum of Natural History (will book tickets in advance)\\nCentral Park\\nMonday:\\nStaten Island Ferry (for view of the Statue of Liberty)\\nNational Lighthouse Museum?\\nWall Street/NYSE\\nBrooklyn Heights Promenade\\nWalk back across Brooklyn Bridge\\n9/11 Memorial (not the museum on this trip)\\nTuesday:\\nEmpire State Building\\nThe High Line or Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum\\nDepart LGA There are many subway lines in the Financial District, several of them having stops in the Brooklyn Heights area. So it will depend on where you\\'ll be in the area - one might make more sense than the other on that particular day.\\nSome of the stops in Brooklyn that are useful for your needs:\\nClark Street (line 2, 3)\\nBorough Hall (line 2, 3, 4, 5)\\nCourt Street station (line R)\\nHigh Street station (line A, C)\\nFrom Battery Park, you could take the 4 or 5 from Bowling Green station. Or the R from Whitehall station. There are several other stations in the area that you could use as well. Wall Street has several stations - one for 4 and 5, one for 2, 3 for example. And some a bit further north, Fulton Street Subway hub with multiple lines and several lines near the WTC area as well. If going from NYSE to Brooklyn Promenade the quickest method would be the 2or 3 to Clark Street. At the Clark Street station you can see what is left of the St. George hotel once the largest hotel in NYC and lot of history behind it. I think overall it¡s a great plan. I\\'d just say\\n- make sure you spend some daylight or sunset hours at Top of the Rock so you can see Central Park which is not lit.\\n- You might consider doing ESB at night OR do ONE Observatory. downtown instead while you,re downtown.\\n- Not sure I would do a museum first day you\\'re here. Maybe wait and see weather. Is that the museum they would prefer? If I were only doing one museum, the Met would be my pick.\\n- Greenwich Village is an area not to miss. Perhaps have dinner there Sun or Mon.\\nA few restaurant ideas:\\nFor breakfast near your hotel, Pick A Bagel and Bubble & Sip for quick take away. For a sitdown breakfast, a Blue Dog is nearby.\\nFor dinner near the hotel, Pure Thai Cookhouse is 2 blocks west of the hotel and a forum favorite\\nSunday brunch is a NYC institution. If you want something nice and memorable, the Loeb Boathouse IN Central Park is a beautiful setting. They don\\'t take reservations for brunch but typically if you arrive when they open (9:30) it\\'s not too long a wait.\\nhttps://www.thecentralparkboathouse.com/\\nFor something more casual near the museum, Barney\\'s Greengrass or Jacob,s Pickle.\\nHope it,s a great trip. I had to google National Lighthouse museum, Id skip that\\nAlso instead of walking across Brooklyn Bridge twice, Id walk across one way and then Walk Across the Manhattan Bridge the other way, Instead of Brooklyn Height Promedname go to Brooklyn Bridge Park in Dumbo (Its in the same area) One of my favorite things to do on just about every NYC trip is taking the ferry from Manhattan to Brooklyn/DUMBO and then walking back across the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset. On my last two visits in April/May of this year the DUMBO/Fulton Ferry Landing was closed, so no stops available there. However, the DUMBO/Fulton Ferry Landing reopened along with a new routing (opening the end of this month) which will benefit you on your upcoming visit offering another routing option.\\nFrom the Wall Street area you could catch the ferry at Pier 11 and take the 8 minute ferry over to DUMBO/Fulton Ferry Landing and explore that area walking through Brooklyn Bridge Park to get to Brooklyn Heights/Promenade. https://images.ferry.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/17023807/6-19-21-Sched-ERv2.pdf?_ga=2.197701295.1429885796.1624743396-603583851.1624743396\\nOR\\nTake the new South Brooklyn route from Pier 11 to Atlantic Ave/Pier 6 and walk from there to explore Brooklyn Heights & Promenade and then cut over to DUMBO/Brooklyn Bridge Park and walk back to Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge. https://images.ferry.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/17023811/6-19-21-Sched-SBv2.pdf?_ga=2.1083697.1429885796.1624743396-603583851.1624743396\\nI love taking the ferries. It gives you a chance to see the city skyline from another view. Great ideas on the ferries! I think it\\'s a good plan and organised by area.\\nBut on the Monday, I think I would walk the Brooklyn Bridge first thing in the morning and work your way back through the rest of the day in Manhattan. August will be hot and the morning views with the sun shining on the Manhattan skyline would be stunning (if the sun\\'s out). Crowds will be less as well.\\nDefinitely take the ferry over to Dumbo. The Natural History Museum recently opened its gems and minerals collection that has been closed for some time for this renovation. I have not made it there yet, but the new display seems rather different from the old one. Parts of your trip will depend on the weather and visibility, so have alternatives just in case. Thanks for this detailed info, very helpful. Thanks for this detailed info regarding the trains and ferry options to Brooklyn. The ferry sounds like fun vs. the train with no views I’ll definitely rethink the museum options as I’m not sure they are the highest interest for the kids.\\nI hadn’t thought of visiting both TOTR and another similar viewing location and think that would be fun for daytime and nighttime views. My teenage daughter and I will be in NYC for three full days to see the sights. I\\'m not sure how to start planning for what we should do - I don\\'t know what is near other things, or the best things to see, or how to get there. When we go to Europe, I like Rick Steves\\' travel guides and how he will map out a day or two of sightseeing. Is there something similar for NYC? I just want someone who knows more than me to plan the whole itinerary... An expensive way to do it is to check out New York City travel books from the library.\\nThe most current ones that they have.\\nSome of them have itineraries , that’s what I did my first trip to New York City.\\nI liked lonely planet the best. But there is Frommers and Fodors and more.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?k=New+York+city+travel+books&ref=nb_sb_noss\\nEdited: 7:17 pm, June 27, 2021 I agree. Most guidebooks have itineraries that would help. That\\'s what I usually do when visiting a new city. I will look at the itineraries and decide which activities interest me and then plan my own itinerary. Freetoursbyfoot.com\\nWalkingoffthebigapple.com\\nboth have self-guided walks. Free tours also has tours and mentions companies with bus tours.\\nhttps://www.smallbustoursnyc.com/\\ngets good reviews.\\nThe way to see what\\'s near what is looking at google maps which also provides directions by subway, walking and car (taxi). https://www.visitacity.com/en/new-york-city/attractions-map\\nThis site is shows A rudimentary idea of where some sites are. You could read trip reports from recent travellers, but it\\'s hard following someone else\\'s itinerary because you might not like all of the things they do.\\nIf you have time before your trip (when is it?) you could easily plan your own itinerary and we can help you tweak it if you post it here on the forum.\\nThe first step is to make a list of the things you like to do and see. This is a good list of what many consider \"must see\\'s and must-do\\'s\" from a tourist perspective: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-s409/New-York-City:New-York:First.Time.Visitors.html\\nMake a list of what interests you. Then look at a map and see what\\'s where. Group things together that are near each other, allowing time between each one for lunch and a break. Also allow extra time for sights that take a little more time to see such as Liberty Island, the big museums etc. And if you\\'re into seeing the most popular and iconic sights that are famous around the world, this is a quick suggestion for 3 days, in no particular order:\\n1. Midtown - Bryant Park, the NY Public Library, Grand Central Terminal, Fifth Ave stores, Rockefeller Center and Top of the Rock, Times Square at night.\\n2. Downtown - Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island (go on either the free Staten Island ferry that just sails by or buy tickets and step foot on Liberty/Ellis Island), 9/11 Memorial, One World Observatory (if not going to TOTR on day 1), the white Oculus, Wall Street, St Paul\\'s Chapel and Trinity Church, take the ferry over to Dumbo and then walk the Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan.\\n3. Uptown - one of the big museums such as The Met or American Museum of Natural History, walk through some of Central Park, see Columbus Circle, maybe go to the Empire State Building at night.\\nMake sure to add food breaks and rest breaks.\\nLet us know if this list interests you or what you like and don\\'t like. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum posting guidelines with prohibiting self-promotional advertising or solicitation.\\nWe ask all of our members to keep their forum messages free of self-promoting advertisements or solicitation of any kind - members affiliated with any tourism-related business should not include commercial contact information or URLs in their forum messages.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 2:49 pm, July 28, 2021 I\\'ve used Michelin New York City Green Guide.

Im interested if you know any book about the making of NYC and its history. Thank you for your kind answers. You might try \"City of Dreams: The 400 Year Epic History of Immigrant New York,\" by Tyler Anbinder. It focuses on the people who came to New York, how they lived and how the city developed.

Has anyone stayed at the Element in New York City in the Junior Suite - if so, would you kindly share your opinion of your stay and this property - I am looking at booking for a month and want it to feel like my apartment not a hotel room. Their suites don\\'t have full kitchens and the location is unattractive. Not what you want. We have stayed there a few times. The jr. suite was barely bigger than a regular room.\\nWe don’t mind the location. Includes breakfast, which is convenient Hi, I had reserved an apartment with WeLive on Wall Street. They just cancelled (no reason given).\\nI found 2 Studios for our group of 6 on 340 West 40th Street.\\nAny tips or advice on this area would be appreciated.\\nThanks everyone! Private apartment rentals in NYC are almost all illegal. Airbnb, VRBO, and other direct routes don\\'t vet the properties to see if they are legal.\\nWhat company did you book thru? That address used to be Staybridge Suites, but that doesn\\'t appear to be the case any longer. I mean, it\\'s right next to the Port Authority(major subway station.) It\\'s a very short walk to Times Sq(another major subway station.) You are basically in Hell\\'s Kitchen which has loads of places to eat.\\nIt may not have a \"neighborhood\" feel, but if it fits your budget, it will work.\\nI can\\'t comment on the actual hotel/property itself. Google maps street view still shows a photo of staybridge suites\\nWhen I google “Staybridge Suites Manhattan” I get “TBA Time Square” (yes Time, without the s) at that address. It is described as “Modern suites in a sleek hotel offering free breakfast, a 24-hour gym & a posh bar/lounge.”.\\nSeems as if something is changing but it is still a hotel. The Time Square reference and use of the word “posh” makes me think their target market is not US residents. I stayed there a few years ago when it was Staybridge. The location was convenient for transport, if not attractive. The hotel was neither sleek nor posh. TBA (to be announced?) is a thoroughly odd branding choice\\nThe reviews are worth a look https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d20143776-Reviews-TBA_Times_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nAre the pictures the same as the Staybridge or does it look as if it\\'s been refreshed?

There’s been a big homeless problem at Port Authority. I wouldn\\'t opt to stay in that location right now. If you\\'re going to split up anyway into 2 rooms, why not pick something in a better area?

We will be touring the Financial District, Brooklyn Bridge, the Met, the Natural History Museum, and Columbia University at a minimum. I’m looking for a Marriott property that offers a safe location, easy access to key subway lines, as much space as reasonably possible, plus amenities like free breakfast would be nice. I currently have a reservation with the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. Should I just stick with that or are there other, better properties? As a price point, I would prefer the lower end Marriott brands, like Courtyard, SpringHill Suites, etc. Thanks! Well if you look at a map,the things you list you want to see are at extreme ends of Manhattan...the Financial district at the southern end and Columbia near the northern end. While staying in the middle (midtown where the Marquis is) could make sense, you could also stay in walking distance of some of the things on your list by staying in the financial district.\\nResidence Inns are the Marriott brand that includes breakfast. Many also have bigger rooms. The Residence Inn Wall St. puts you in the financial district and near the Brooklyn Bridge. The Residence Inn Times Square is actually across from Bryant Park and has kitchens and free breakfast and suites. There are also a bunch of. Courtyards in various locations. None include breakfast but some do have rooms with 2 queen beds rather than the more typical for NYC 2 doubles. The Courtyard Midtown East has some rooms with 2 queen beds and sofabed if the teens don\\'t want to share.\\nEdited: 10:11 am, June 28, 2021 In addition to the Residence Inn Wall Street (fairly new property, I believe?) in the Financial District. There is also a Residence Inn Downtown / World Trade Center in the area that has pretty big rooms as well. Thanks nywhiz! Yep, we’re bouncing all over! I planned for Times Square, because it’s central (and we’ve stayed there in the past). I’ll look at the other options, particularly the Residence Inn. Thanks maxisweden! I’ll check the Residence Inn WTC. It looks like the Residence Inn Financial District doesn’t open until September. The Marquis has some of the largest rooms of any Marriott property in NYC. Northern_Traveler00, that’s what it looked like from my initial research. Thanks for the confirmation! We stay at the Residence Inn near Bryant Park and really like it. Good size rooms, close to several subway lines, a block from Bryant Park. It’s a good central location but not as busy as Times Square I\\'ve stayed at both the Marquis and the Residence Inn Times Square. No free breakfast at the Marquis (their lounge is still closed, if you happen to be a Platinum or Titanium member) although the rooms are indeed quite large. I really like the RI being right across from Bryant Park and of course you do have free breakfast there. I would avoid the Marriott hotels on West 40th and West 37th.\\nIf there are other Marriotts you want to ask about, just mention them. I\\'ve stayed in many of them for business over the years and am happy to offer my opinion. Although Post Covid, there have been a lot of changes - most not for the better! The only thing about the Marriott Marquis is their 2 bedded rooms are doubles rather than queens. So unless you get a room with a sofabed, 2 will share a double bed, not so great imo. Yeah, my teens won’t share a bed. I bring a backpacking air mattress, get additional bedding, and they rotate between the bed and floor. Bigger rooms are better if they’re not cluttered, so we can carve out floor space for the air mattress. We are planning a trip for the last week of September. Flying into Newark with Four adults, four kids (one in a wheelchair). I have looked at the Millenium and Soho 54 but we can stay in Newark for half what these hotels are. Question is: How would we accomplish getting into the city and how hard will it be with the wheelchair?\\nIf it were you, would you bite the bullet and pay the extra? Bite the bullet. Pay the extra. Especially with someone in a wheelchair, but I would have said that anyhow. Do you want to tour Newark or NYC? There’s not much to see in Newark and it would be quite the schlep to try and come in daily from Newark. Especially w four kids and a wheelchair. There’s a reason it’s more expensive, the convenience is everything. Thanks guys. That\\'s what I wanted just confirmation that it would be pretty difficult to go back and forth with the wheelchair. I thought it would but my daughter didn\\'t. Agreed. Stay in Newark if that is where you want to vacation There was a time when Newark was a place to be avoided. Things have likely improved over the years, but it is not convenient for visiting NYC as others have mentioned. Usually, people are advised to stay near a NYC subway station, though this would not be the case with an adult size wheelchair. A smaller stroller for children would be another matter. The subway does not go beyond the city limits, but does include Queens where you might find more affordable hotels. Always check the map for the proximity of a hotel to transportation. Bound Brook Park in newark was designed by Frederick Olmstead (The same one as Central Park) and its actually a very beautiful park\\nThat being said when dealing with a person with mobility issues you need to stay in NYC and I dont think the Subway will work for your either, you will need to take Buses and Taxis Fully agree with #2, don’t even think twice. I recently stayed at Club Quarters at the World Trade Center. I flew into Newark and took a taxi to NEWARK Penn Station (15 minutes/$18). From there we rode the PATH train directly to World Trade Center (30 minutes/ $2.75 pp). It was fast and convenient.\\nThe OCULUS Transportation Hub at WTC is stunning and state of the art. I have to imagine this station was thoughtfully designed to accommodate wheelchairs.\\nClub Quarters is only a few short blocks away. I highly recommend staying in this area if you want to explore lower Manhattan (Brooklyn Bridge, South Street Seaport, Wall Street, Battery Park, the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn, Battery Park City, and Tribeca).\\nI also highly recommend taking a sunset river cruise. It is a lovely way to see the city from the water. Since you would be crossing state lines, staying in NJ would waste vacation time and have extra commuting expense (that, for a group of 8, could be substantial and better spent on a more conveniently located hotel - minimum $5.50 per day per person and up)\\nI\\'d also wonder which - *if any* - of the bargain hotels that you looked at are within walking distance of accessible transport (PATH train https://old.panynj.gov/path/maps.html OR NJ Transit https://www.njtransit.com/ ) Many EWR adjacent hotels are not anywhere convenient for transit, dining, etc.\\nWithin the city you should also give some consideration to transit. Few subway stations have elevators. The entire city bus system is accessible https://new.mta.info/accessibility\\nI can\\'t think of any circumstances where it would be a good idea for a group like yours to stay across the Hudson P.S. within the NYC city limits you can use Accessible Dispatch to call a fully wheelchair accessible Yellow cab https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/accessible-dispatch.page\\nHowever, if the wheelchair user can transfer, using the occasional regular cab might be suitable\\nBe aware this service is not available in NJ and your group will not fit in a standard for cab or car service vehicle I\\'ve always plastic wrapped my baggage myself to prevent accidental zippers opening on international flights. Why myself? Because those wrapping services at the airports are closed after business hours when my flights usually take place... I tried those straps around luggage but they all break easily...\\nBut in October 22020 during Turkish Airlines check-in in Terminal 1 they made me remove all wraps from both of my bags citing some new rules against self-wrapping, supposedly to prevent carousel damage or whatever. The wrapping service was, of course, closed late night.\\nCan anyone confirm that this is indeed a new rule or that attendant made it up?\\nThanks! I would contact the airline or post this query in the Air Travel forum. I\\'ve never had a zipper come undone on a suitcase. And I do put straps on and they have never broken.\\nPerhaps buy higher quality luggage or straps? Or don\\'t overstuff the suitcase? Thank you, sorry for posting to wrong forum.

I would expect the school to help on this , especially for students who are only high school age. I expect many families would be reluctant to take on responsibility for the child of a family with whom they have no connection.

Five women traveling to NYC for a birthday celebration in September. Suggestions for good place to stay? Would you be okay with paying for two rooms? Would it be okay for two of the women to share a double bed or would two queen beds in one room be required? To get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station (OR if driving and need parking - directions of travel) and 4) hotel budget.\\nNormally September can be pricey due to demand from business travel and the UN General Assembly. No idea what this year may be like with the reopening of Broadway etc. Well you don\\'t say what your budget is or your preferred sleeping arrangements. If you wanted to stay all together, the only place I can think of in that area would be the 2 bedroom suite at the Dominick in Soho. It will be expensive and someone will have to sleep on a sofabed. If you\\'re willing to split up into 2 rooms, then I\\' guess budget , number of beds and amenities will narrow options. The Moxy hotels (one on East. I’ll age and one in. Chelsea) are well liked, new and trendy but not much storage space. Hello,\\nMy 12 year old son and I are coming to NY 7/14-18 and I’m looking at attending Yankees game Thursday or Friday evening. Wondering if one is better than the other considering we are planning on taking the subway. Thanks!! Friday might be little better, but IMO Sunday is the best as that is family day and alot of famalies go to weekend day gaes Can’t see that it matters much. If you were going by car, Thursday would be better. But subway on game night will be filled w yankee fans for at least half the ride. What day has the best weather? Sadly the 10 day forecast doesn’t go out that far yet. Even if it did it doesn’t have much accuracy I would go to the Friday night game. But it won\\'t really matter as it is Yankees vs Redsox. Either game will work. Hi everyone! I\\'m visiting New York City July 16-21, so I have 5 nights there. I\\'m a mid-30s single man, and I want to experience some night life. I\\'m going by myself, so I want to meet people, locals and/or tourists, and see the city life (I live in a very small town). But, I DON\\'T DRINK ALCOHOL! What would be good recommendations for places to go around 9-12pm at night, where I can socialize, maybe play some pool, throw some darts, etc? Somewhere where interaction with strangers is expected, I don\\'t want to just go sit alone in a booth at some fancy restaurant. But where most, or all of the people aren\\'t getting drunk. And not going to cost a small fortune would be nice...\\nIf it matters, my hotel is in Hunters Point, but I\\'m mostly visiting places in Manhattan and Lower Manhattan. But I\\'ll be travelling by subway, which goes all over the place I think.\\nThanks! Baseball Games\\nEither Citifiled or Yankee Stadium depending on who is in town\\nTickets arent that expensive, You can socialize with people there What do you do when you\\'re not on vacation? Do similar things in the city. \"Pool and darts\" tend to go hand-in-hand with drinking in this city. But you could try a Billiards Hall like Amsterdam Billiards (rather than a bar). Most people will be drinking, but perhaps it would be more secondary to the games (rather than the other way around like in a bar).\\nEdited: 5:39 pm, June 24, 2021 @blumebwaybaby,\\nI live near a small town. There\\'s nothing like a city here, or nearby. If I\\'m out at night, I\\'m doing something like fishing, camping, or a nice bonfire. Plus, I have friends around here to hang out with. Don’t forget to ride the ferries. Inexpensive and picturesque.\\nMany people don’t drink alcohol these days. Even at rooftop “bars” and “beer gardens”. They often have non-alcoholic beers available or “mock tails”. However, if simply being around people who drink is not appealing, then skip that.\\nI’m not up to date, but has Chelsea Piers fully reopened?

Is there any bus to accomplish this? My friend is on a budget and can’t afford to pay Uber or Lyft fees or a taxi. Any public transport option like airport buses that run direct ? Google search didn’t turn up much. Where on SI does your friend need to go? Sorry. I can answer that but I believe is not too far from the Verrazano bridge. Like 2 miles away. Google maps shows some public transit options that go thru Manhattan and Brooklyn and take 2 1/2 hours to get to “Staten Island”. With a specific destination that might take longer. Getting to that part of SI just add more time. Expect a nearly three hour public transit ride with at least four changes of vehicle plus thirty minutes of walking.\\nUnder twenty minutes by car or ride share, depending on traffic.\\nEdited: 7:27 am, June 27, 2021 I\\'m really wondering what the money saving will be getting a few types of public transport, for 2 hours, than getting an uber / lyft / taxi.\\nI used google maps, and just put in an address near the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. The first leg of this includes a trip on the Newark Airport Express Bus. The cost is $18 for one way, then the SIM1C Express Bus costing $6.75. Total $24.75. Plus TWO HOURS of their time.\\nI just checked Carmel Car Service, and they\\'re quoting $44.50 for a ride, and would take 20 mins.\\nSo yeah, it\\'s $20 cheaper, but to me, that $20 is worth saving 1 hour 40 mins at a minimum.\\nM IF they are coming here as a tourist any hotel on SI will be *very* inconvenient\\nIMO the only possible reason to consider staying on SI is a free place to stay with friends or relatives The shortest way that I know of is a bus that goes across the Bayonne Brdge to the Hudson Bergern Light rail\\nI suppose someone could take the bus from Newark Airport to Newark Penn Station, Take the Path train to grove St and Hudson Bergan Light rail to last stop and take S89 Bus to Staten Island However the S89 bus only runs during rush hour One would think that Staten Island being close to Newark airport and part of NYC there would be cheaper and easier options to go from one to the other. Most people on Staten Island have a car or could afford a taxi to the airport, There is no real central spot on Staten Island and lastly I dont think there are really very many people going between Newark and SI. There are only 450,000 on Staten Island and very few of them are going to the airport on a particular day and almost no tourists are doing that trip Ter 1413. She said Fingerboard Road. A few blocks from the bridge. We are coming from Philadelphia and thinking of visiting the SoL from Liberty State Park in NJ and then driving to Citi Field for a Saturday @ 4pm game. We want to drive so we can leave Citi Field and go straight home. I would prefer not to drive through mid-town Manhattan (or if I had to, a least stressful route), any suggestions? I suppose Staten Island Ferry can’t really help? The Problem is Iiberty State Park is near the Holland Tunnel, to Avoid Manhattan you either have to go South to the Bayonne Bridge and through Staten Island or go North to the GW Bridge (and Cross Manhattan Briefly) and take the Triboro Bridge to Citifield Thanks, those look like good alternatives. I typically would prefer adding time as opposed to heavy traffic. I am thinking we would leave SoL for Citi around 1:30 or so. Am I being too paranoid about midtown Saturday traffic? I have been in the GW bridge area and do seem to remember that being pretty congested. I don’t necessarily want to make this too hard. You’re overthinking this. Take the Holland Tunnel. Go south around tip of Manhattan up the FDR. To avoid tolls, take Brooklyn Bridge, but there will be traffic. Faster, go up to the queens midtown tunnel - on a Saturday, it’s fine. Don’t even think about going from Liberty state Park to Bayonne, through Bayonne to the bridge and then through Staten Island. That’s just nuts.\\nYou will not encounter too much traffic on Saturday.\\nEdited: 11:40 pm, June 23, 2021 **Am I being too paranoid about midtown Saturday traffic?**\\nYes. Citi Field is near Flushing and I always preferred the Whitestone Bridge, Cross Bronx Expressway, and GW Bridge route to NJ. Driving through Manhattan is a pain and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to the Verrazzano Bridge was my least favorite road given its winding route and abrupt entrances. After dark, I would suspect this would be even worse. The Cross Bronx is straight through by comparison. If you take the Whitestone, exit 14 at Linden Place is the nearest exit to Citi Field. You could drive a bit along the service road and then turn left on College Point Blvd., but the Roosevelt Ave. Bridge has reduced lanes due to construction and it might be easier to immediately turn left on Linden Place to Northern Blvd. for the bridge there to the stadium. Whatever route you select, be sure to study the map beforehand. Radio traffic reports are also quite useful.\\nEdited: 6:51 am, June 24, 2021 I live near Citifield. As long as its not the height of Rush hour, It takes about an hour to get to Liberty State Park.\\nWaze gives you the quickest route. Now that I think of it, The Van Wyck Expressway which is part of the route top get to Citifield from Staten Island is ALWAYS Jammed up, I take it frequently and its always jammed up between JFK and Queens Blvd.\\nJust a side note are you actually going to the Statue of Liberty from Liberty State Park or just seeing it from the Park. Im not sure you will have enough time to go to the Island and back in time. If you want you can Just go to Liberty State park and get amazing views (from the Backside) Of the Statue and Ellis Island (You can even see the Bridge to Ellis Island (But you cant use it)\\nThere are also some amazing views of the Lower Manhattan Skyline from there as well\\nand btw #LGM Thanks for all the help. It sounds like I am overthinking this. I\\'m bagging the Bayonne bridge idea. I\\'ll keep these options in mind and pair it with the real-time Waze and just route accordingly.\\nWe were planning on visiting the islands of Ellis and SoL but will get on the 10am ferry. I don\\'t think we would be the full three hours. But even so that still will give me 2-3 hours to make it to Citi field for 4pm.\\nLooks like we are tracking to see deGrom so I can’t expect much from the Phillies but hopefully the kids enjoy the ballpark!\\nThanks again! If you have / plan to get SOL/Ellis tickets with an NJ departure (?) that is a factor.\\nIf yes, IMO it would be better to have SOL/Ellis tickets from Battery Park even though you\\'d pay more for parking in that area. That way you can arrive earlier in the day and be closer to the stadium. The time you\\'ll burn going from NJ to Citi Field midday will be a frustrating waste.\\nThe time on Statue Cruises tickets is for the airline style security line - not a specific ferry departure\\nEdited: 8:14 am, June 24, 2021 If you have a smartphone, download the WAZE app as Howard said and follow directions since they get real time traffic reports. I don\\'t think you are overthinking this since you\\'re traveling unknown roads some of which will have heavy traffic. Ironically traffic on Sat. in Manhattan shouldn\\'t be heavy at all, but on the highways you need, you will run into traffic for the game and perhaps the beach.\\nRight now the fastest route would be the Holland tunnel and drive briefly in lower Manhattan to the Williamsburg bridge, take that to the BQE (Brooklyn Qeens Expressway aka 278) to the LIE (495) to the Gramd Central Parkway to the Stadium parking.\\nPerhaps a less stressful option is to leave the car parked in NJ and take public transport back and forth. If you’re interested, post back for options.\\nAlso, frequent forum poster Ziggy lives in Staten Island and is a Mets fan. He might have some other options that might help. Waze is going to say take the midtown tunnel - my advice is to reset waze to a no tolls option. You can take either the Brooklyn bridge or the Williamsburg bridge (both free). Either works. One route may be slightly more backed up on any given day, but once you opt away from the queens midtown tunnel option (which tells you to stay on the fdr until 34th st), waze can give the relative times.\\nI grew up not far from the Holland tunnel, which is close to Liberty State Park and in a big Mets/Jets family. My dad would take the Holland to the queens midtown (he doesn’t like bridges). I would do the Brooklyn bridge.\\nYou could take the northern route over the GW. But it’s longer because Liberty State Park is part of the ABC Turnpike extension, the travel up to the GW is longer on the Jersey side.

Several are outside Manhattan, one even in NJ!\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/maps/best-waterfront-restaurants-bars-nyc I\\'ve seen that list,Risa, and continue to be perplexed about why Perry St. gets listed. I like the restaurant and the food, but there really isn\\'t much of a view once you\\'re inside. Am I missing something?\\nChart House inWeehawken,, NJ also has great views and is an easy ferry ride from Manhattan. Yes, you always make that comment because I’m the one who always suggests it! I like it. It’s good enough for me to see the view and then focus on the food. ☺️☺️ Very helpful article, Risa L. Thank you. Fact check for #8 in the Eater article\\nThe first sentence is TRUE. Hudson Eats is in Brookfield Place. [BUT it’s on the SECOND floor where the views are mostly blocked by trees. BUT you can take your food to eat in the Winter Garden or on the plaza outside where the views are nice.]\\nThe rest of the description is FALSE. The picture is NOT of Hudson Eats, it’s of the restaurant on the FIRST floor, which is now called Liberty Bistro, I think, but it keeps changing names so I can’t keep up. Good views, however.\\nAmong the places listed, Chopt, Sprinkles, Tartinery, and Black Seed Bagels are inside Hudson Eats. The rest are NOT. Inside HE are also Olive’s (great sandwiches), Dos Tacos, Umami Burger, and maybe another one or two that have reopened and a few that have closed either temporarily or permanently; hard to tell.\\nAmazonGo (NOT a restaurant, limited takeout), Starbucks Reserve, P.j.Clarke’s, and Seamore’s are in Brookfield Place, in other locations. So are (unmentioned) Sant’Ambroeus, Del Frisco, and a coffee place next to the health club, all of which are open as of now. Parm is reportedly closed forever. The nearest Juice Press that is open is I think in the Fulton Transit Hub 1/2 mile away; the one in BP is closed (inside the health club).\\nSo misguided “facts” about downtown are not limited to TripAdvisor. Don’t believe everything you read on the internet. It’s incredible that a presumably reputable site can make so many errors in three sentences and I start to wonder about the rest of the article. Excellent points! I got the email yesterday (or the day before). You should comment on their site!! How bout this (once its reopening)\\nhttps://www.manhattarestaurant.com For an article that claims to be “updated” a day ago, it’s really inexcusable. Are these writers getting paid? Others they missed are Merchant’s River House (good sunsets, nice place but not a crazy scene) on the lower\\nHudson and Watermark Bar on the East River. I don’t post on sites like Eater because I end up getting a ton of spam and I don’t trust them to understand privacy. I\\'ve had brunch at Celestine (Shakshuka of course) and the view is as good as the picture in that article. It was a quiet morning and not many customers but I sat there lingering after eating and had two teas because I enjoyed the view so much. Their outdoor patio area would be stunning in summer at night.\\nThere are many more they could have mentioned, but they limited it to 14. Way uptown at Dykeman a new restaurant has replace the much locally hated La Marina. The location was always fabulous. The new place is The Hudson and while I have not tried it, it looks very tempting. And, mind, they are still looking for workers--but Isn\\'t almost every restaurant currently in that predicament. If you make the long trek up town on the A train to 200 it might be a nice way to end the day. Or you could walk down through the park after visiting The Cloisters. https://www.thehudson.nyc Girls trip to NYC Nov 8-11, 2021. I understand Broadway will re-open in September/October timeframe. There was a kiosk on Times Square that used to sell same-day tickets for Broadway shows at discounted prices. Does anyone know whether that operation will resume? Or do you recommend we just purchase our tickets in advance on-line? TKTS does plan to reopen - keep an eye on their website https://www.tdf.org/nyc/7/tkts-ticket-booths\\nHowever there are a lot of unknowns about how the theater reopenings will go (how many shows will be open and how high demand will be etc.) for availability\\nEdited: 8:42 am, June 25, 2021 Lots of online ways to buy broadway tickets in advance on discount. Theatermania, Playbill, and Broadwaybox are the websites we\\'ve used As someone who has used both TKTS & the discount sites mentioned above, I prefer getting my tickets in advance so that I\\'m not spending my vacation time waiting on the TKTS line. Also, please note that there is something to be said for buying on line in advance as you can get a better selection of seats. TKTS sells only seats that have been released to them within 24 hours so those seats can be more picked over than buying in advance. Caveat - some folks have lucked out & gotten released house seats which are ones that the producers have held for vips but that is a big gamble IMNSHO. Broadway tickets went on sale in early May and we were able to get good seats within the first few days they went on sale. The longer you wait, the harder it is to find decent seats. Book of Mormon tickets went on sale the other day at prices they were in 2011 (some special they were doing if you signed up for early access) so those were only $99 for row A front mez. Hamilton was $200 row A front mez.\\nIf you know for sure you are going, then start looking now. Waiting in line all day at the kiosk isn\\'t much fun. I did it once with a friend and we got there at 8am. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever do that again lol One additional note, at least pre-pandemic, discounted seats on the internet don\\'t go on sale until about a month or so before performance. So if you are looking at a show & it shows that the discount period ends before your travel dates, it just means that you have to wait for the next block of seats to go on sale if you are looking more than a month out. If you see discounted tickets, even if your date is farther out, to me it\\'s worth wating to see what will come up (caveat - discounted tickets tend to be scarcer in the winter holiday season.) I imagine the booth will resume. I have already been asked to renew my online TDF membership. However, I wouldn\\'t be surprised if first months of booth operations were not same as before, maybe not as much on offer. Blockbuster hits like Hamilton are in any event rarely at booth. At first only the big shows are opening, the secondary ones which might have extra tickets to sell (The TKTS booth only sells leftover tickets) arent opening until later.\\nThat being said , I do disagree about not standing on the line, in my experience the line hasnt been that bad and with no foreign tourists I dont think there will be many people clamouring for these tickets epecially on a weekday -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 11:15 pm, June 27, 2021 Is anyone else having problems with these pesky Stella beer ads blocking content so threads become obscured?

We will be coming to NYC for 5 days on July 1st prior to departing for Greece. We are traveling from within the US and we are all fully vaccinated with an approved vaccine. I know that we each have to fill out the New York State Traveler Health form, but I cannot find any place that tells me what time frame it needs to be filled out prior to arrival. For Greece and London (which we will travel through), the traveler forms need to be within 48 hrs of arrival. Does anyone know if that is true for New York as well or is there no time frame associated?\\nTIA The NYS form says no earlier than the day before arrival. You actually have to get almost all the way through filling it out before you come to this issue.\\nhttps://forms.ny.gov/s3/Welcome-to-New-York-State-Traveler-Health-Form Thank you!

We\\'re driving down from Albany in Sept for a Mets night game. I\\'m from LI so I know the lay of the land.

I know they say they have parking at the hotel, but I didn\\'t see any details. Free? $$ ? I suppose I could call, but thought I would try here first. On the TripAdvisor listing it says “..paid public parking on-site.” I also note they’re included in park and fly packages. I,m assuming you\\'ll pay. Call them. In the hotel website it says \"if you travel by car there is a parking close to the hotel with an aditional fee, but the hotel cannot guarantee the parking place.\"\\nhttps://www.marcolaguardiahotel.com/services.html\\nI\\'m guessing this is the parking they\\'re referring to (same address).

Looking for hotel in SoHo with either 1 king or 2 queens. Nice view. Near coffee shop/cafe. 500.00 or less per night.

Without dates, hard to know which will fit the budget. You might try looking on\\nTablethotels.com\\nMrandmrssmith.com\\nboth search engines that specialize in boutique hotels and may have better pricing. I would select not just Soho but also Noho, Nolita and TriBeca. Several of the nicer hotels have pools although they,re really just for dunking. Sixty Soho and the Dominick are worth checking.\\nEdited: 1:15 pm, June 24, 2021 Crosby Street Hotel, The Mercer, The Broome \" 500.00 or less per night. \"\\nThat should be virtually any hotel in the area.

However, several reviews report that the hotel needs \"refurbishing\". Has anyone here been there \"recently\"? The Dominick has needed refurb for a while. But rooms are large, they have a pool and lots of amenities. If it was updated, it would be over budget. Unless you\\'re seeing reviews about bad service or not clean, I think it may be your best option. Look at reviews here and elsewhere (Yelp, the 2 websites I gave you, booking.com etc.).

We (2 adult + 1 infant) are looking for one bedroom apartment in Manhattan for an extended stay (1-2 months) from August. I am aware of the short term rental city law. Preferences in priority order\\n1) 1 separate bedroom so that baby can sleep well with doors closed\\n2) Full kitchen including cooktop/stove\\n3) Luxury and furnished. Willing to spend up to $400 per night\\n4) Location with good walking and dining options.\\n5) City skyline view\\nI checked this fantastic post https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k8782932-New_York_City_New_York.html, and found AKA, Club Quarters to be relevant. Wondering if there is anything else I should look at? Thanks so much for your help! $400/night might not do it but\\nMarmara Park Avenue is an upscale hotel that does longterm rentals and might work.\\nThere are lots of buildings in lower Manhattan in the financial district that could work.\\nOakwood.com\\nIs a co. That does rentals with buildings in various locations.\\nThe Phillips. Club near Columbus Circle does monthly rentals. We had a good experience renting a furnished apartment for my daughter for a month through nyhabitat.com. The apartment was as advertised, our contact at nyhabitat was helpful. It may be worth taking a look at what they have available. True luxury buildings would likely take a very dim view of any tenant, often an owner, renting out their unit. Thanks for wonderful suggestions!\\n> There are lots of buildings in lower Manhattan in the financial district that could work.\\nMy reading is that financial district is not super walkable in night, and doesn\\'t have a lot of dining options\\n> nyhabitat.com\\nSeems like a really good site. I have checked airbnb for long stays and didn\\'t find much options. FiDi is plenty walkable. True, not a ton of restaurants, but there are some good ones. And 10-15 minutes away is Chinatown and TriBeCa with lots of choices Not sure what you mean by “not super walkable at night.” It has sidewalks and street lamps like the rest of the city, and if you want wall-to-wall street dining there’s Stone Street between Coenties Slip and Hanover Square, and Front Street between Beekman and Dover and Pier 17. BatteryParkNYC, it’s gets exhausting to keep describing our neighborhood….I love being able to walk around here at night. And plenty of restaurants (I haven’t been to Temple Bar lately but a friend said the atmosphere has been really fun and lively) w my faves being Felice and Crown Shy, w Bellini in the Seaport area up top too. The parade of people walking their dogs in front of the stock exchange at night is quite a sight. Risa, our tastes in restaurants are different, but so what. Besides the destination restaurant places you like, I’ve managed to mostly eat south of Canal Street for over a year now, without feeling deprived. We will have to agree to disagree about Tacombi, where I really like the avocado tacos and the crispy fish ones and the agua fresca (I’m not a foodie or Mexican food expert though). A return to Felice is on the agenda and waiting for Carne Mare to get settled and give that a try.\\nFor those of you who haven’t been here for over a year, everybody except Risa and I seems to have gotten a pandemic dog, which makes riding the elevator and walking around the streets a lot of fun. Watch where you walk, though.\\nEdited: 8:48 pm, June 24, 2021 I like the crispy fish ones too! They’re actually my favorite! The avocado is my second favorite.\\n(And you’re so right about pandemic puppies!).\\nI’ve managed to stay below 14th St all year, except for getting my hair cut.\\nEdited: 8:59 pm, June 24, 2021 Thanks for providing your perspective on Financial district. Will definitely consider that in my list now.\\nAlso wondering if there are other long term stay/rental apps/websites that I should check other than airbnb?\\nI was also thinking of leasing for 1-2 month, but that might be too much of a hassle for a trip.\\nEdited: 12:48 am, June 25, 2021 Hi, is Hayden Planetarium included with the Museum of Natural History? Or is it a separate ticket? They Sell a joint ticket, but you can just get the AMNH admission alone Thanks Howard. What about if I have the 6-attraction CityPass? That includes AMNH but doesn\\'t say anything about Hayden Planetarium. And if it\\'s not included, is it possible to purchase *only* the Hayden Planetarium? The only thing that attraction passes cover is basic admission. For anything special you have to pay extra (which is one of the reasons that attraction passes are not really recommended on this forum. The planetarium was always a special charge even when the AMNH was free years ago. This has continued with its new building. I believe you can walk around the lowest level and see the planetary models with regular admission, but not go upstairs for the show. To answer your question, no, you cannot just buy it as an add-on. You’ll need to repurchase full admission plus the planetarium. Hi! My boyfriend and I are staying in Midtown Manhattan for the Fourth of July weekend (Saturday-Monday) and neither of us feel comfortable driving into NYC. We would like to park our car overnight in New Jersey and then take the ferry, bus, or train into NYC. Does anyone have any suggestions on the best options for overnight parking and then transportation into the city? We were looking at parking in public parking garages in Hoboken and taking the ferry, but worry about not having any space when we get there (because you can\\'t reserve a spot). Thank you! Port Imperial in Weehawken would work well:\\nhttps://www.nywaterway.com/indoorparkinggarage.aspx\\nFor convenience, it\\'s easy to drive into Manhattan and park near the far west side for example. This way you don\\'t have to do a lot of driving. It depends on where you\\'re coming from and where in the city you\\'re going to. Thank you! We will be coming from Allentown, PA (South of NYC). Do you know if those parking garages fill up fast? Where is your end point? JMO July 4th weekend the city will be a little emptier as many locals tend to go away, especially this year as July 4th weekend is an extra day, I dont think Parking will be an issue Entering and parking in the city on holiday weekends is easy.\\nWe have already booked parking thru Spot Hero for the weekend at a very good price, 1/4 mile from our hotel. I have parked at Port Imperial many times and I highly recommend it. The garage is clean and it is an easy walk from there to the terminal. The last part of the drive before you get to Weehawken can be a little unnerving, especially when it looks like you are headed to a tunnel (you are heading in that direction but you exit before that). There are free buses when you get to the city that may take you close to your hotel depending on where you are staying. If I don’t take the train, Port Imperial is always my preference. https://www.nywaterway.com/ For those who got married in NYC, did you wear your dress all day and evening?\\nPlan on getting married in July around 5pm as it’ll be slightly cooler at that time then heading somewhere for a meal and drinks but I would love to keep my dress on. Just wondering what everyone else did? I would not necessarily count on 5pm being slightly cooler in nYc in July. It could be. It also could be very warm at that time.\\nIf your dress is white, I would just be worried about spills, etc.\\nThat being said, if you want to wear your dress, go for it. You will get some people staring, but then most will go back to doing whatever it is they were doing. I was in a restaurant in Skaneateles (a fancy resort town near where I live) with a friend when a party arrived & one of the ladies was in a wedding dress. Not only did no one stare but several of us wished her & her groom congratulations. Wear the dress!\\nOne of my favorite photos from my wedding was dancing in the middle of Madison Ave. Now if only I could cut the ex out of it… ;). I agree do what makes you happy. Fashion i is one thing in our lives we control as an individual.\\nI don’t think you should care what other brides have done ,do what you want to do.\\nI bet you look stunning in your wedding dress. When you feel beautiful you are beautiful. Aww that’s nice thank you! Is it july this year Christina?\\nOnly thinking of the travel restrictions in place...\\nBut in answer to your question....\\nWEAR IT ALL DAY....\\nyou only get married in NYC once... Hi, no it’s 2023 so a wee whiley away and hopefully no restrictions!\\nYeah absolutely come to think of it!! Congratulations on your upcoming wedding! Wear that dress all day/evening long! My daughter will be getting married in NYC July of 2022 and plans on wearing her dress the entire day/evening. In fact, much to the surprise of her future mother-in-law, who expects the traditional wedding party dinner in a fancy restaurant, they have opted to dine outside at the Madison Square Park Shake Shack in their wedding attire chowing down on burgers, fries and concretes.\\nA NYC wedding would be so cool! The photo ops are endless! Check out the photos from the wedding photographer my daughter has chosen to hire for her big day. They make me want to marry all over again in NYC, but I\\'d have to find a new groom who loves NYC like I do-lol My husband is no fan.\\nhttps://danilamednikov.com\\nEdited: 1:54 pm, June 24, 2021 Hi, I’m quite a shy person but I just have to think it’ll only be once I get married in NYC!\\nWhat time of the year is your daughter getting married? That’s another thing im scared about wearing the dress all day is that im looking to get married in July but I know it’ll be really hot!\\nWho did your daughter book with or is she dealing with everything my herself?\\nThat’s one thing im struggling with is somewhere to go for the reception.. everywhere is asking for a minimum spend and then to include taxes etc!\\nThank you so much for your help!\\nChristina Hi,\\nWe will be in NYC (upper west side) from July 3 to 8. On July 8, we are flying to the Caribbean. 3 to 5 days prior to arriving in the Caribbean, we need to provide negative Covid test results. In a prior post, someone had recommended CityMD as a location we could receive a rt-PCR test. My hotel tells me that wait times are crazy and that I cannot make a reservation. Are there other locations I might try? I would like to have a back up plan in case we can\\'t get into a CityMD. After some research I see that Manhattan Medical Arts takes reservations. Any feedback on them?\\nThanks in advance! When did you ask your hotel? I live across the street from a CityMD (although not on the UWS). At one point, there were very long waits with lines wrapped around the block. Now there are no lines, it\\'s just walk up and walk in.\\nI\\'ve gotten a bunch of tests over the last year. Only once was it a real problem, and they told me to come back first thing in the morning, which I did. I don\\'t expect that there will be long lines next week. But going about a half hour before they open isn\\'t a bad way to approach it. I hope someone else has feedback on the place you mentioned, I never heard of it. Hi Risa, I just spoke to the hotel front desk this morning. Perhaps the long waits are something he heard about, but not actually witnessed. Have you done a PCR test at CityMD? What has been your experience with turnaround time? I spoke to them a couple of months ago and an employee told me that, initially, labs were slow to turnaround the results but that it has gotten better since. For one of our stops, I need to test within 72 hours of arrival. I\\'m just hoping results come back in time! I’ve probably had 5 tests or so at CityMd. The wait times have varied, first one was quick, then maybe 3-4 days. The rapid one was 20-30minutes. The last one I did was early March, “pcr technique” rapid results and it was less than a half hour The long lines and long waits for turnaround were a year ago, when testing first became available. I had one at CityMD (Fulton Street) and it took quite awhile waiting in line and several days to get results. I had one in April this year, same place, and it was walk right in, results later that day or the next (don’t remember exactly).\\nThere are also mobile vans around the city (locations change) and some storefront places popping up. I got one in March for a Caribbean trip from a mobile van at Wall and Water, which I thought was dicey but got results later that day, no charge. The company was LabQ, which now seems to only have locations in Brooklyn and the van has moved on, but there are other companies doing the same thing.\\nYou can enter “Covid testing” in Google maps and it will show you places (I think they’re mostly office or storefront; not sure if vans show up). When you get here you’ll notice some of these places in your area and you can just stop in and make a decision based on their projected turnaround and pricing. Make sure you know if/what they will charge.\\nI’m curious what hotel doesn’t keep up on this? Many of us who got regularly tested every 2 weeks stopped going once we were fully vaccinated. Lines that used that used wrap around the block in Brooklyn are basically nonexistent now. Planning a trip to NYC November 11-15. Traveling will be three sixty something sisters. We are looking for a hotel within walking distance of Broadway theaters. (Come From Away and the Tina Turner show are at the top of our list at the moment). We need one room with any size bed and one room with two double or queen size beds. Budget is $1800.00 total. Hilton brand is preferred. Thanks for your recommendations. So two rooms for $1800 for 4 nights basically $900 a room or around $225 a night. Take a look at Hampton Inn Manhattan Times Square North. 8th Ave between 51 & 52 St. Close to the theater district without the crowds of Times Square. Several convenient subway stations and good food options nearby. Per Google maps, .4 miles to your theaters. Should be just about your budget for 1 room king or queen bed + 1 room 2 queen beds. Another good option but non Hilton (but maybe cheaper) is the M Social Times Square (formerly Novotel). Rooms are large and poster Basingstokecambridge recently posted about great opening rates if you book now. Join their frequent guest program (Millenium) and get even lower rates.\\nThere are also several Hilton Garden Inns with Times Square in the name that would work. NYC is ready to WELCOME tourists again.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IBqI7G-VQg I like it. It\\'s a good ad, very catchy. who is the wonderful vocalist in the 2021 New York City ad singing New York New York Love it! Of course I’m crying over it, lol. 😭 💕 🗽 Just wish it was longer. Welcome back New York! And thanks for welcoming us back!!!\\nThanks ISDW! Nothing there in Queens, At least show the Unisphere\\nThere were 2 in Brooklyn (I think) Brookyln Bridge Park and Grand Army Plaza (I think it was Grand Army Plaza with the Arch) Maybe the Arch is Washington Square Park in the Village and Not grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn This is fantastic. Thanks for sharing. Hi! My 19 year old daughter and I are traveling to NYC July 28-August 2nd for girls trip and also to see my younger brother that lives in Brooklyn. We would love hotel recommnedations for a hotel in good location for transportation to get around, some local coffee/diners and shopping. From initial review of posts it looks like maybe Midtown or my brother mentioned maybe Union Square area (not sure where that is in relation to Midtown) and looks like there are quite a few options for around $200/night. We have not been to NYC since daughter was younger, so in addition to just enjoying the city we will hit some of the popular spots such as central park, Times Square, Empire State Building, Natural History and MET museums,One World Trade Center + 9/11 memorial, and boat tour. We would like 2 queen or double beds and possibly a kitchenette (not critical). We are Marriot Bonvoy members so Marriot is great, but not a must. Would also be open to an updated boutique hotel.\\nWould love any other recommendations for must see places and places to eat also. Thanks!! Ask your brother which subway line(s) is / are near his part of Brooklyn, in case you plan on visiting in his home. If you want to stay somewhere near a line that would make that train ride easier of course. Making switches is of course possible though, too. That might sway at least me one way or the other on where to stay.\\nEdited: 4:47 pm, June 20, 2021 Good question from Maxi! A couple of my favourite Marriott hotels have been the Residence Inn Central Park and the New York Edition.\\nThe RICP is the highest hotel in North America (used to be anyway) with excellent access to Central Park and many Midtown sights, and the Edition is located right by Madison Square Park which is not far from Union Square. That one is more expensive though.\\nNot sure if they\\'ll be within $200 p/n though.\\nFor a girls trip, I think rooftop bars and possibly a nice afternoon tea would be good, if they appeal to you. What is your preferred bedding configuration? Another Marriott property that wasn\\'t bad is the Residence Inn Downtown/World Trade Center. Rooms there are bigger than average and have a kitchette. And probably cheaper than the other two I mentioned.\\nIt\\'s way downtown and close to the WTC and 9/11 Memorial (very walkable from the hotel) but you\\'d need to subway uptown to your other sights. Subway access is great from that hotel, the Fulton St subway station is right there with access to many lines. And another good one in that vicinity is the Courtyard Downtown / World Trade Center. No kitchenettes there but it\\'s cheaper and if you have a Memorial view room, it\\'s really pretty at night. Subway uptown when needed. Aynat has given you good options. The Marriott brand with kitchens is Residence Inn. They have lots of locations here. All are good. I believe all include breakfast in the room rate. I like views and the views at the Central Park location are wonderful. The downside is the rooms are small, but well designed. Another one in midtown not mentioned is the Times Square one but it\\'s not really in Times Square but just behind Bryant Park. It\\'s an older hotel but well maintained but no views. Both have good subway connections nearby.\\nWhile there are plenty of places to eat near both, neither are really in a neighborhood but more in business areas. Would make a lot of sightseeing easy.\\nI agree with your brother about Union Square being a good location for what you want. Unfortunately there are no Marriotts that I can think of nearby and the few hotels that are there have no kitchens. Hyatt Union Square, W Union Square....and then there are some trendy boutique hotels nearish like the Maritime, the Dream Downtown, the Gansevoort and the Standard High Line. Some don\\'t have rooms with 2 beds.\\nThe High Line hotel is lovely, housed in a former seminary on a beautiful property but it’s likely more than you want to spend. Btw, you can see where Union Square is located by mapping it on google maps. It’s got a major subway station and sits at the crossroads of Chelsea, the village and the flatiron district.\\nI think you might give serious thought to whether you might share a king bed. Rooms with 2 beds are more expensive and less available. Online, the Residence Inn Central Park, which I think comes closest to what you want, doesn\\'t have a 2 bedded room online for your dates (although they do have rooms with 2 double beds).\\nThere are quite a few Marriott brand hotels in the financial district which puts you closer to Brooklyn and very close to the 9/11 memorial, but that much further to Central Park and the 2 museums you mention,\\nSince I don\\'t know how important price vs 2 beds vs Marriott vs kitchen vs location is, I can\\'t really advise. If you don,t mind giving up the kitchen, the Courtyard Central Park in the same building as the Residence Inn might be the best all around option. Union Square is pretty much between Downtown (9/11, Freedom Tower, Trinity Church, Wall Street, New York branch of the Museum of the American Indian and ferries to SOL, Ellis, Governor\\'s Island and Staten Island) and what most people consider Midtown (Empire State, Grand Central Station, MOMA, Rockefeller Center/Top of the Rock, St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral and shopping along 5th or Madison). The south end of Central Park is usually considered the line between Midtown and Uptown, so Central Park, Museum Mile, and AMNH and Lincoln Center are slightly north of what most people would consider Midtown.\\nHope that helps a little. We stayed at the MSocial recently in Times Square and it was nice and price was decent.\\nDef make a reservation for the Met. The line for those without one was HUGE last week.\\nSome stuff you don\\'t have on your list that was fun for us and grouped together: Little Island, Highline, The vessel.\\nYou also didn\\'t mention Central park. You should definitely plan to spend some time there. It\\'s fun to just walk around and see what you find...lots of musicians, etc. We came across some music (dj) with roller skaters and it was fun to people watch there. You can also plan to see certain things... Belvedere\\'s castle, strawberry fields, Bethesda Fountain, etc. Central park is always my kids\\' favorite thing about NYC (age 19 and 15).\\nI don\\'t have many suggestions for food as I struggled to find food i wanted to eat when i was there last. But I did really enjoy Havana Central in Time Sq. Thanks for all the great recommendations to check out and helpful information. We do prefer 2 beds as my 19 year old daughter sleeps much better (and we are both happier if she gets her sleep...lol!) with her own bed, but double is fine. We could do without a kitchenette as assume most have at least a fridge. We do definitely want to hit Central park as that was a favorite and my brother gave us a great tour there on our last trip (quite a few years ago now when kids were younger). Thanks for all the help! Any other tips welcome! Thinking about taking the subway from Manhattan on Saturday night and having dinner in Brooklyn before walking over the Brooklyn Bridge.\\nAny suggestions for a reasonable dinner (entrees less than $30 - maybe not pizza since I think we\\'ll have that the night before) . We might try to walk along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade before walking across the bridge.\\nThanks! My favorite restaurant in that area is the River Deli - no relation to the 100x pricier River Cafe - which serves Sardinian/Italian food on a beautiful & atmospheric block of Joralemon. (Full disclosure - it’s been several years since I’ve been there, but my friend in the neighborhood still likes it.) Last I knew they did not take reservations & were cash only.\\nOther posters here have said good things about Seamore’s, a seafood place down in DUMBO. I haven’t tried it…truth is, for whatever reason, this isn’t an area I tend to think of when thinking of where to go for dinner.\\nEither of these places would be within your price range - well within of you opted for pasta or lighter entrees.\\nOh, and there’s also the TimeOut Market, which is fun & would give you lots of choices, but may be more informal than what you’re seeking. It’s essentially a high-end foot court. Cecconi for Italian is another idea. If you like seafood, cocktails and beer, there\\'s a Seamore\\'s on Water Street.\\nI was also going to suggest Time Out Market, that one has a rooftop area with food and drink (I think it\\'s open). You\\'d get great views over to Manhattan. Thanks! Time Out Market might work perfect for us! When we lived there, our favorite go to spot was Superfine. Casual place with a funky atmosphere and very good food for the price. For whatever reason, the tourists don\\'t seem to know about it. Maybe because it isn\\'t in a setting that looks like a mall. Much better than Timeout market. A proper sit down restaurant. If you are there on a Saturday afternoon, maybe they will have brought live music back. Used to be one of our favorite ways to spend the afternoon. Lunch, some cocktails and a band. One other thought, Vinegar Hill House. Quiet street. Beautiful setting. Stellar food. A place where you will still see more residents than tourists. Entrees right around the $30 spot. Probably one of the best places to eat in the Dumbo area. Big +1 for Vinegar Hill House (at least if it’s as good as it used to be…it’s been even longer since I’ve been there than River Deli). My only caveat is that it’s a hike from the bridge, through a somewhat industrial area by a ConEd (I think?) substation. On the other hand, the isolation accentuates the charm of the micro-neighborhood.\\nNice to read positive words about Superfine - I’ve never been there (no idea why not) but it’s been on my mental list & has just moved higher. I always thought vinegar Hill was such an interesting name for neighborhood. I quite like it.\\nGiven it’s location I often wondered why it was never mentioned ( Until now to my knowledge)on this forum. LaRue400, Vinegar Hill does get mentioned from time to time - I know I’ve suggested it as a worthy detour on occasion. But I think the walk there is a deal-breaker for many visitors - it’s honestly not that far, but for people who’ve walked or are planning to walk the Brooklyn Bridge, it must seem that way - and the tucked-away character of the neighborhood, which gives it so much charm, means it’s not on the way to anywhere else.\\nEven a lot of locals aren’t familiar with it - I detoured there once with a group from my Brooklyn-based running club, and no one else had ever seen the former navy yard commandant’s house behind its iron gate (one of the neighborhood’s cool sights). ^\\nAgree.\\nWhile it is a cool name, most people/tourists focus on DUMBO & Brooklyn Heights as there is more to do/see.\\nI have been to many events at the Navy Yards and pass by VH. It has a few cool things to do/see. However, for the first time visitor, they will probably be attracted to DUMBO/Brooklyn Heights vs VH. Hi everyone.\\nMe and my girlfriend are heading to New York from Mexico tommorow. We\\'ve read on the New York health department page we WON\\'T have to quarantine ( I believe this was updated on April 10th) . We\\'re both vaccinated, and just staying for 5 days.\\nIn turn, we\\'ve gone to fill out the State covid entry form, and it says because we\\'re international travellers we must quarantine for a week? This directly contradicts what it says on their website. Does anyone know if they\\'ve just forgotten to update the form after the advice was changed because CDC advice and new York state advice both says we won\\'t need to quarantine so is this just an error?\\nThanks Did the form ask what sort of vaccine you\\'ve had? Because you are not considered fully vaccinated unless you\\'ve had Pfizer, Moderna or J&J. Any other vaccine is not part of the US emergency approvals yet.\\nRead this document in particular the \"Fully Vaccinated\" definition.\\nhttps://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory The form didn\\'t even ask about vaccines. It repeated what I assume was the requirements for travel prior to April 10th. Didn\\'t have any information about a test after 3-5 days, or vaccine exemption. We have both had Pfizer. For reference the confirmation says\\n\"Thank you for completing the NYS Travel form. All international travelers with a final destination in New York State, including healthcare workers and essential workers must follow CDC guidance for international travel. Therefore, all international travelers must either quarantine for 7 days with a test 3-5 days after travel, or quarantine for the full 10 days without a test.\\nThis requirement applies to all international travelers whether they were tested before boarding, are recovered from a previous COVID infection, are fully vaccinated, or meet health care worker/essential worker status.\"\\nThis is the old advice? It\\'s confusing. Per the CDC if someone is asymptomatic then quarantine is only required for international travel when the person is unvaccinated. Fully vaccinated people don\\'t need to quarantine unless they had a positive test or are showing symptoms.\\nEdited: 10:18 pm, June 23, 2021 So even though the form says I need to quarantine, I don\\'t? The NYC website definetly reads that I don\\'t need to. The advice looks like the old one? We\\'re just staying Friday and Sat nights. 2 adults with 2 beds. We booked a place in Hell\\'s Kitchen but were informed after booking that it seems to be a bit more dangerous to due to increased homeless population. Want to try something similar in price 300 a night or less and perhaps somewhere that is a bit closer to the center without being straight up Times Square. Where to look?\\nEdited: 3:21 pm, June 23, 2021 What are your plans for the short visit? Close to what center - sights are spread out? We\\'ve both been to NYC before, so the touristy stuff isn\\'t the draw. we\\'re not worried about seeing sights so much as just exploring the city. We want to visit the city for low cost (as much as low cost NYC can really be lol) while being central-ish, so that we can on a whim go where we feel. We have local friends to guide our trip somewhat, but we want to make the potential drunk, late night trek back to the hotel safe and moderately affordable for the two nights we\\'re there. Being in the middle of times square isn\\'t the worst thing in the world, but it is a last resort if we really do want to change our accommodations on such short notice. >>Want to try something similar in price 300 a night or less and perhaps somewhere that is a bit closer to the center without being straight up Times Square. Where to look?<<\\nMidtown East. I would enjoy area ssuch as Union Square or Greenwich Village for example. East Village perhaps too. Lovely areas. Don\\'t know if the hotels in those areas fit your budget, but you could always check. Lots of bars, restaurants etc in those. Very walkable too and great for general \\'hanging out\\'. Subway lines too if you need to travel further. What is your current booking? #5 - Hopefully a legal hotel not a most likely illegal short term apartment rental? We are going to be there the same 2 nights, taking NJ Transit. We got a AAA rate at the Renaissance Midtown for $167 a night (no resort fee, but taxes will be added.) I got upgraded to a skyline view room as a Titanium elite. Nice hotel, safe (but meh) location. But easy to walk with our bags from Penn Station. Looking forward to being back in NYC for the first time since January 2020... # 5 Comfort Inn Midtown West. Near 48th and 11th Leaving aside any concerns about safety, the location is a long trek from the nearest subway station,especially in hot humid weather. Ended up finding a new hotel and canceling the old one. Now im booked at the Hampton Inn Grand Central, near the UN. Thanks for the help everyone. With 70% of adults vaccinated,Covid restrictions lifted: https://mobile.twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1404838602509590538 And there will be fireworks!\\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/melissadderosa/status/1404843413367840771 Oh fireworks near where you are, Risa. Nice!\\nDoes that mean no facemasks in subways for example? \"Unvaccinated individuals will still be responsible for maintaining proper social distancing of six feet and wearing a mask as per federal CDC guidance. Consistent with the State\\'s implementation of the recent CDC guidance, masks will still be required for unvaccinated individuals. Large-scale event venues, Pre-K to 12 schools, public transit, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes and health care settings will be exempt from the restriction lift. In those settings, New York State\\'s existing COVID-19 health protocols will remain in effect.\"\\nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-most-remaining-covid-19-restrictions-be-lifted-when-70-adult-new Also, please remember individual businesses still have the right to ask you to mask up when you go into their establishments. I believe public transit is governed by federal regulations and so masks are still required.\\nI told the CTA here in Chicago for the first time Saturday, our restrictions were lifted Friday, and there were only two idiots not masked up in my car. Great news! We are heading up for 2 nights at the end of the month for some birthday shenaningans (which doesn\\'t consist of that much since I am turning 61, ha!) The last time I stepped foot in NYC was January 2020, it feels like a lifetime ago :-( https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos-videos-nyc-reopening-fireworks-burst-over-new-york-harbor\\nFireworks from last night! Thanks for posting! I missed the fireworks by a day, but I share the spirit. My DH and I will be flying in to JFK from Madrid in October on British Airways. We then have to pick up a Delta flight. Delta recently changed our flight we have 1-1/2 hrs on the ground. Is that enough time? Would appreciate thoughts. Thanks! Customs is never an issue. Immigration can\\nTough to say what\\'s happening in T7 while you arrive. But 1,5hrs can be quite risky (with leaving the plane, immigration, luggage pick up, customs, airtrain to T2/T4 and re-checkin). Did you buy this on one ticket or multiple?\\nDid you buy direct from the airline?\\nI don\\'t think the connection will work. If one ticket bought from the airline they will make it work somehow. You might be delayed but you won\\'t be stuck. If you bought separate tickets or thru a third party that could be a big problem I don\\'t think BA and Delta are airline partners\\nPretty sure they use different terminals at JFK Thanks so much - you confirmed what I suspected, even though I\\'m not real familiar with JFK. Thank you for your reply - I bought these tickets separately. Fortunately, I was able to rebook on Delta for a later flight out of JFK that allows plenty of time. Thanks again! Looking for Comedy clubs or spots in Manhattan that are now open and have performers. Any spot that you would recommend? I was checking on line and all the clubs seem to be open. Comedy Cellar, Gotham, Caroline\\'s, etc.\\nCheck schedules and book what sounds good to you Agree.\\nI would look at the usual suspects and the lineup and pick based on that...and your schedule. Hello!!\\nJust returned from our (teen daughter and mom) week-long trip to NYC and I thought I would write a trip review. First I would like to thank everyone who answered my posts and gave mw ideas and suggestions, you all made a huge difference. First and foremost those who suggested I change hotels from Moxy Time Square to Moxy East Village. The East Village was a wonderful place to stay and we loved it. Lots of places to eat and explore. Thanks so much!\\nDay 1.\\nWe arrived via train from WashingtonDC. We used the Vermonter Regional (29 bucks) and the service was excellent. Very smooth trip and great value. We arrived at the new Moynihan Train Station. It is beautiful and worth exploring. We really liked it and would have had breakfast there but the food court was not opened yet. We ubered to our hotel with zero issues.\\nThe Moxy East Village is well located and fun with well-designed rooms and free breakfast, it was a good value and we would stay there again. After checking in, we walked to the metro station (14street and Union Square) and bought our weekly pass which we used a lot. We took the subway to the High Line and walked the whole thing, it was fun but it was a hot day, still worth it though. At the end of the High Line we came to Hudson Yards and ate lunch at Mercado Little Spain, it was delicious and fun. We walked around after lunch and saw the Vessel and the Bella Abzug park. Our plan was to walk to Pier 83 for our Circle Line Sunset Cruise but it was started raining hard so we postponed our cruise (excellent customer service at the Cricle Line Cruise) and went back to the hotel to chill. After the rain stopped we walked to East Village Pizza to taste our first slice, it was excellent, and then called it a day,\\nDay 2\\nWe started our day with breakfast at Veniero’s and then took the train to the American Museum of Natural History which we had prebooked. We enjoyed our visit and after that walked around and saw.\\nFifth Avenue\\nRockefeller Center\\nFAO Schwartz\\nThe NBC Studios store\\nThen we had a slice at 2Bros pizza and continued to\\nSt Patrick’s Cathedral (it was closed bec of a graduation)\\nNY Public Library\\nBryant Park\\nGrand Central Terminal\\nTime Square\\nThe M&M Store\\nWe had dinner at Cacio e Pepe in the East Village which was excellent.\\nDay 3\\nStarted our day at Think Coffee for breakfast and then took to the train to St. Patrick’s Cathedral which was open so we got to enjoy it, it was magnificent. We then visited the MoMA (pre-booked timed tickets) then picked up some lunch at Pret a Manger and walked to Central Park to have a picnic lunch there, we then walked to The Literary Walk, Strawberry Fields, the lake. We then took the train to the FiDi and saw\\nThe 9/11 memorial\\nThe Oculus,\\nTrinity Church Cemetery\\nThe Fearless Girl\\nWall Street\\nThe Bull\\nBattery Park.\\nWe had a slice at Joe’s Pizza (amazing) and gelato at Eataly.\\nWent back to the hotel to rest a bit and then had dinner at Mari Vanna NY and thoroughly enjoyed our Russian dinner.\\nDay 4\\nStarted our day withna walk to the Flatiron district where we stood in line to scan our code to be able to enter the Harry Potter store later on. Then had breakfast at a cafe next the Flatiron Building. We then took the train to Dumbo. We explored the area and visited Time Out market (wished we had waited to have breakfast there), the carrousel, took the obligatory insta pics in front of the BB the walked the Brooklyn Bridge to Mahattan and saw City Hall, the Superior Court building (kid is a Law and Order fan) walked to Chinatown and had lunch at Mimi Cheng’s which has excellent dumplings and scalion pancakes. We planned to have dessert in the Little Italy area but before we could do it we got our text to return to the Harry Potter store so we took our trian back to the Flatiron district and enjoyed so expensive shopping. After a short rest in the hotel and dropping off our bags we headed to our postponed cruise. We took a train towards downtown and had a oizza dinner at 99cent Pizza. It was satisfactory and great value. We walked to pier 83 and enjoyed the cruise. It was abit overcast but it was till fun and I welcomed the rest. Kiddo is a walker and I was pretty exhausted. We took an uber back to the Moxy and called it a day.\\nDay 5\\nWe got up early and had the hotel complimentary breakfast and headed to Battery Park for our ferry to Liberty Island and Ellis Island. It was a great experience and we loved it. That afternoon we met up with friends from New Jersey and enjoyed late lunch at Eataly Flatiron and a walk around the area, including the Lego Store for the kids. After a rest at the Moxy we walked to Taralluci-e-Vino for dinner which was delightful!\\nDay 6\\nStarted our day taking the train to Time Square for our brunch at the Magic Hour, a rooftop restaurant atop the Moxy Time Square. It fun because it is all pink and they have a carrousel with roses you can sit at but the food was over priced and mediocre. Still, it was fun for the teen. Afterwards we took the train to Brighton Beach and enjoyed exploring and shopping. It was so fun, and I would have prefered to eat lunch there but the instagrammable bruch had won. Still we shopped for fun things at St, Petersburg Gifts and Taste of Russia and then walked the boardwalk and enjoyed seeing the Russian community enjoying their Sunday shopping. After a rest at the hotel, we walked to Gnocco for dinner. It was a great recommendation, we loved it!!\\nDay 7\\nStarted our day with Bagels at Bagel Belly and then took the train to see the Metropolitan Museum of Art which took up most of our day (prebooked timed tickets) and was just wonderful. We had lunch there at the cafetria (expensive and mediocre) but it allowed us to spend more hours there. After an amazing day at the Met, we took our train back to the East Village and had gelato at Amorino for a treat, walked a bit around the East Village and saw Grace Church. After a rest at the hotel we walked (in the rain) to Veselka for our last dinner and loved it!! Excellent and delish.\\nDay 8\\nHad our last New York breakfast, bagels at Bagel Belly and check out of our hotel. Took a cab to JFK (used the arro app) and flew back home.\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our trip and cannot thank this forum enough for all the help. You made a huge difference.\\nThanks!\\nExhausted and cash poor mom and happy teen! This is a wonderful trip report! I so appreciate that you took the time to write it - I was so happy to see a few of my suggestions made it to your itinerary (sometimes you wonder if it\\'s worth the time to answer questions!). I\\'m glad you had such a great time - you certainly made your way around the city - and hope you come back soon!\\nGlad your daughter enjoyed her shopping expeditions! Thank you Risa!!! You are all so helpful and knowledgeable and you made a big difference. We just loved NY and felt very safe at all times, whether walking or taking the subway and only got lost once! We found people to be helpful and kind and the food, OMG!!!\\nClaudia So happy to hear! Spread the word! And come back soon. So happy to read your trip report! Happy you enjoyed staying in East Village. Such a lovely areay. Veselka is one of my favorites - a great neigborhood spot. Good stuff, glad you enjoyed. Great report! Could you speak about the bathroom in your hotel room. I note it has those translucent sliding doors. Is it private enough for people who would like privacy or can you see through the glass. What a fun report to read - so glad you had a good trip. NYwhiz the bathroom at the Moxy is perfectly private. It has a sliding door for the toilet and the shower glass enclosure is tinted with faux graffiti. Perfectly fine!!\\nClaudia Thanks for posting, i love reading trip reports of NYC and have missed them so much these last 18 mths Nice trip. Thanks for your trip report. I bought a family membership for the AMNH but can’t figure out a way to get the reserved time tickets without it asking me to pay. I’ve called twice (no response to messages left) and emailed (auto response thanking me for joining and to call for questions). Anything I’m missing or any suggestions? Did you log in to your profile before trying to reserve?\\nSays you need to do so on the ticket page. Yes, I’m logged in and then i click “reserve tickets”. It says log in if I’m a member. Since I’m already logged in, I click on the tickets I want and then the date. Then i go to checkout and there is a total. No place to check if I’m a member. Hmm. Weird. Can\\'t help you any further. :/ Hope you get a hold of them. Try logging out and opening in a new browser window. Click on tickets and then add in that you’re a member after you try to buy tickets. It may “read” it at that point. I’ve had that problem on other websites.\\nEdited: 2:56 pm, June 23, 2021 Yeah, what Risa says is what I was thinking - you might have to take the transaction to completion to be able to then get the member benefits. I\\'m thinking of how it works getting online tickets for an event that\\'s free and still needing to go to \"pay\" where it then turns out to be free Thanks for all the help! I was able to get some help through email and we were able to work out the problem. My email addresses are very similar and the wrong one auto populated for the login. Since it wasn’t the same one I used to buy the membership, it wouldn’t work. User error! Yay, another TA success story, jk, glad to hear you solved your problem, and thanks for letting us know. My daughters (ages 21 and 16) and I (also female) have a trip planned for a week in NYC during the week of Christmas this year. We will be staying at the Archer Hotel in the Garment District. I have been seeing a lot on the news about the as they say “skyrocketing crime in NYC”\\nIn the opinions of locals, do you think it would be safe for three females first visit to NYC this winter. We plan to see and do many of the main tourist attractions, Broadway, 911 museum, Statue of Liberty, MET, Empire Sate Building, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Dyker Heights etc\\nWe are not at all familiar with the area as it’s our first time .\\nWe planned to walk a lot.\\nWe are looking to the Christmas vacation very much as it was originally planned for last year but was cancelled due to pandemic. Its greatly exaggerted. Havent had any issues Crime stats will show increases in some crimes and decreases in others. The stats change all the time. Statistically, you will be fine, but there have been increases in crimes.\\nHere is an example of the May stats from the NYPD:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/pr0603/nypd-citywide-crime-statistics-may-2021\\nI disagree with Howard about crime being exaggerated. There are many quality of life issues that are not being addressed and it\\'s causing crimes from those that are unstable. Crimes such as unprovoked attacks and such are on the rise and have been happening for some time now. These are happening in areas where it was not normal before.\\nJust one example, a man was slashed on Friday night around 7:30 pm while standing on a subway platform in Times Square:\\nhttps://abc7ny.com/new-york-city-times-square-stabbing-subway-crime/10807433/\\nI\\'m in and out of that station on a regular basis and it scares the hell out of me to hear of something like this. Will I stop using the subway, no, but I\\'m more careful than ever. There are some here that have not used the subway because of crime.\\nCrime is one of the top issues of the mayoral race, it\\'s typically the top story on the news most days. You\\'re hearing about the crime in Georgia, so imagine what we hear on our local news sources, etc Take the news for what it is, they are reporting on incidents that have happened. They\\'re not making up these stories. [they say “skyrocketing crime in NYC”} - Yes they like to say such things don\\'t they? NYC Is a city of over 8 million people and that doesn\\'t include the tens of millions that come to visit or commute into the city. The media will rush to publish any crime story they can get their hands on. There are some quality of life problems but don\\'t let the hysteria get to you. As long as you use commonsense you are unlikely to have any problems. Also, I was on the subway today and it was quite crowded. Plenty of people are using the subway and the Archer hotel is not in an area where there have been a lot of problems. Add to that the fact that come the end of July they are moving people out of the hotels and back into the shelters so that should cutdown on the number of homeless people in midtown and also get them reengaged with services that have been lacking for too long. With every day there are more and more visitors/workers/residents out on the streets so by winter I imagine things will be much closer to pre-pandemic normal barring a variant surge. I took my daughter right before the pandemic hit and it was fine. It\\'s like any big city. Don\\'t flash money, don\\'t talk to strangers and be aware of your surroundings. We stayed on 43rd Street and traveled by lyft, we walked and took the bus with no problems. I felt perfectly safe. Broadway was amazing, Central Park is beautiful and the Metropolitan is a must see. I can\\'t wait to go back. My daughter has lived in NYC as a student since she was 18 and has traveled the city by herself with no issues (but good street smarts). I’ll visit her this fall as a solo female traveler and have no hesitation in doing so. I just googled it....seems there are 365,000 unmarried women in Manhattan. And we do just fine. Of course, as a local, I know where I\\'m going.\\nDo your research, plan your travel methods, stay in a safe hotel in a known area. After 9 or 10 at night, probably better to take a cab as you may be tired and not as comfortable navigating in the dark. But otherwise, you are fine. I would not let my wife or daughter go to NYC alone anymore. They city has become a crime infested hell hole. They have Defunded the NYPD. There was a tourist attack on the subway today. There was also very good article in The Post today about how the DAs are refusing to prosecute criminals who destroyed many businesses in the city last year. It has gotten so bad I’m actually suing to force my ex to move my daughter out of the state of NY entirely. Here is the link to the afore mentioned article.\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/06/20/nycs-prosecutors-are-imperiling-us/amp/ To the best of my knowledge, there has been no \"Defunding\" of the NYPD. If they aren\\'t addressing certain issues it is more likely because they don\\'t want to. They tend to see themselves as our \"9/11 heroes, fighting the war on terror;\" hence fewer resources available for more lowly undertakings. If they don\\'t have as much $$ available for crime fighting as before, it is more likely because every year more and more $$ is required to fund their giant, triple tax-free defined benefit pensions payable in full after 20 years, regardless of age. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff has removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guidelines with regards to off-topic chat.

Also the DA seems to be doing a good job investigating and prosecuting a certain real estate crime family so they seem to be appropriately funded. Duplicate thread from yesterday Re #2 You don’t speak for the woman who was attacked .\\nYour statements about NYPD and DA are not fact based and are completely your biased opinion .\\nThis is a travel forum, as tourists we should get and need the truth not hyperbole.\\nOnly thing truthful in this OP is that a adult Colombian woman was randomly attacked on the subway. Article in The Post yesterday. I think a DA’s office refusing to punish criminals is travel related. It lets people know that if they are victims of a crime they might receive 0 justice. It is an open advertisement that NYC is safe haven for criminals.\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/06/20/nycs-prosecutors-are-imperiling-us/amp/ People come here for unbiased advice from local experts, not political divisiveness & fearmongering from 800 miles away. People travel and use TripAdvisor to get away from that crap. I’m sure there’s a dark web political conspiracy forum that would love your input. Just how was it proven that NYC is no longer safe for tourists? One person was attacked and that makes it unsafe? Only you and your alter ego believe what they read in the Post.

Do not forget that crime is one of the top issues in the mayoral debate. And crime is all over the news here, they\\'re not making up these stories.\\nEdited: 8:52 pm, June 22, 2021 Hi! We are planning on vacationing in NYC July 24-29 and I am starting to feel overwhelmed with hotel choices! We\\'ve stayed in Times Square a coupe of times and this trip I would really like to find something in a quieter area. I would ideally like a Marriott property and am debating the Renaissance Chelsea or the Moxy. The rooms at the Moxy seem really small so right now I am leaning toward the Renaissance. We will probably be getting 2 rooms and one will need 2 beds for my 16 & 17 year old son and daughter. My other thought is would we be happier close to Central Park. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Honestly you can stay anywhere just depends on activities Which Moxy are you looking at? There are several. But I do believe most (all I\\'ve looked at anyhow) have slightly small rooms. The Moxy rooms are not only small, but they have no real storage...no closet only drawers under the bed. The bathrooms are not terribly private which may not suit the teens. They are trendy. There are 3-4 locations. East Village is a “cool” area with lots of good dining nearby. The Chelsea location is not really in-the heart of Chelsea but more in what was the flower district. It\\'s very close to Penn station.\\nThe Renaissance Chelsea is a few blocks further south. Between these 2, the Renaissance makes more sense for your family, imo. If you want to be closer to Central Park, the Courtyard Central Park would work. Marriott has loads of hotels down in the financial district now. It\\'s breezy down there near the water and might make for a very different experience. Just depends on your plans.\\nEdited: 9:16 am, June 22, 2021 Just returned from a week in NYC. Stayed at the Moxy East Village. It was a great location and we had lots of places to go for dinner. The rooms are teeny but well designed and the hotel has a young cool vibe. Highly recommend it.\\nClaudia Since you want to stay in a different area this time, I agree with the others about the Moxy East Village. Can\\'t speak for the hotel, but location wise, you\\'ll be happy. Thank you for your recommendations! Denise, Claudia, who stayed at Moxy East village says the bathrooms are fine.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13586161-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nSo you just have to decide whether the size of the rooms will be ok. The Moxy East Village is my favorite NYC hotel. I just came back from another stay there last week. Yes, the rooms are small, like many NYC hotel rooms, but they are ingeniously designed with everything you need (ask for a mini fridge) and don’t feel small. There is an outdoor back patio where you can just relax or have a drink/food. It is in a fabulous neighborhood that actually feels like a neighborhood, where people live. The streets are lined with restaurants and it is walkable to the Village, Soho, the LES, Union Square. Highly recommend. I agree with Bookat. Loved the Moxy East Village. And they have larger rooms, including some with a queen bed AND bunk beds. Our room was the least expensive but suited is fine. It has a clever design with pegs on the walls to hang things and space under the bed. The bathroom is private, both toilet and shower stall. The area is fantastic. Lots of fun places to eat, lots of people walking, two subways stations close by. Cannot recommend it enough.\\nClaudia Just booked the Moxy East Village! Thank you all for your advice :). Looking forward to our trip!! Hi,\\nWe are due to travel next year to NYC for my Mums 60th birthday and will have an 18 month old with us. I’ve been reading through the forum regarding travel from JFK to Manhattan and it looks like joining the queue for a cab is the best option.\\nI believe cabs are exempt from car seat law but my plan is to buy and travel with a car seat that I can easily fit with a seatbelt as I wouldn’t feel safe without, will we be allowed to fit this in the queue before we leave?\\nThere will also be 6 of us, will 2 taxis be big enough for us with 6 cases, hand luggage and a stroller? And am I right in thinking this will be approx $80 per taxi?\\nThanks in advance Yes, Yellow cabs and car services within NYC are exempt from the car seat laws.\\nYes, you may bring and use your own car safety seat in either type of vehicle https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/passenger-frequently-asked-questions.page\\nYes, the fare for a Yellow cab between JFK and anywhere within Manhattan is a fixed rate (both directions 24/7) that comes to ~$80/per cab after tip, surcharges and possible tolls https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page\\nTwo Yellow cabs should be able to accommodate you and your gear.\\nHowever, for airport transport, I\\'d also comparison price one larger car service vehicle that can also provide a child seat. (Dial 7, KidCar UberFamily)\\nIf you bring a car seat make sure you understand how to install it properly https://thecarseatlady.com/category/using-taxis/ P.S. Assuming you\\'ll be using public transport to get around - be aware few subway stations have elevators and you must fold strollers on city buses https://new.mta.info/accessibility/stations Thank you so much. That’s really helpful You\\'re welcome\\nhttps://mommypoppins.com/new-york-city is a good resource for parents\\nThere are also a lot of parks if you need to run off some toddler energy https://www.nycgovparks.org/\\nHappy planning After a year of confinement due to Covid, we\\'re trying to find a vacation we can get to without getting on a plane & were looking at NYC. Apparently Broadway is closed. We would be going mid-July. Are things generally open? How can we find information on which tourist attractions are open? Any recommendations for top sights/activities? Sorry, just starting to look into this, so I thought I\\'d go here first... Thanks! everything is open except for Braodway (There are other shows open). No limits on anything Masks are optional Masks are not optional in all cases. Mask requirements remain pretty much unchanged for unvaccinated people. For vaccinated people it is up to the individual businesses to decide what their policies are. The subways, schools, government buildings etc all still require masks.\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-face-covering-faq.pdf Open!! Some places may require timed reservations - the best way to find out about individual policies is to check websites.\\nAs far as top things to see and do, it’s entirely up to you. We have fantastic museums (the Metropolitan for an encyclopedic collection, the Museum of Modern Art, a bunch of smaller art museums, the American Museum of Natural History…); great neighborhoods for walking & exploring; beautiful parks; amazing skyline views (from pricey observation decks or for free from bridges & parks); the Statue of Liberty; outdoor performances; etc. etc.\\nKnowing a bit more about your interests (why pick NYC?) would be helpful. And do take a look at trip reports here (not a whole lot of recent ones, unfortunately) and the “top questions” link. I dont know how you are getting here but Parking is an issue, It is not cheap to park your car in Manhattan, It can cost $30-$50 a day to park in Manhattan Here\\'s a link to the must sees and dos from the faq on the right column of this page titled “ top questions about nyc”. Everything on it is open except Broadway shows.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-s409/New-York-City:New-York:First.Time.Visitors.html\\nMid July will be hot and humid. A cruise or two would be nice.\\nSail-nyc.com\\nThere are Jetski tours, but pricey\\nhttps://www.seathecity.com/jet-ski-tours/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIv_yAiLWm8QIVGYvICh0CIQFNEAAYASAAEgIq-PD_BwE I was there last week. Some places required a mask regardless if you are vaccinated or not. (i.e. Metropolitan) . Most places required masks for unvaccinated.\\nSeemed a lot of restaurants were closed, but that\\'s all I noticed.\\nIf you plan to go to any museums, make sure you check, on line to see about timed entry. If they recommend it, do it for sure. The line at the Met for those without a reservation was huge. We also needed a timed entry for the Vessel as well. Walking on the High Line was required on a weekend as well. At the Empire State Building, masks are no longer required for everyone and at The Edge for vaccinated visitors. Effective May 19, New York State has adopted the CDC’s \"Interim Public Health Recommendations for Fully Vaccinated People” for most businesses and public settings.\\nhttps://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home\\nBusinesses are authorized to require masks and six feet of social distancing for employees and/or patrons within their establishments OR adhere to CDC guidance, which advises that fully vaccinated individuals do not need to wear masks or be socially distanced, but ***unvaccinated individuals must continue to wear masks and be socially distanced in most settings.***•\\nThe Department of Health strongly recommends masks and six feet of social distancing in indoor settings where vaccination status of individuals is unknown.Any mask requirements that businesses choose to implement must adhere to all applicable federal and state laws and regulations (e.g., Americans with Disabilities Act)•*This provision applies across most commercial settings, including but not limited to retail, food services, offices, gyms and fitness centers, amusement and family entertainment, hair salons, barber shops and other personal care services, among other settings.\\nHowever, Pre-K to 12 schools, public transit, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and healthcare settings are exempt and must continue to follow the State\\'s existing COVID-19 health guidelines until more New Yorkers are fully vaccinated Starting June 15, the state no longer mandates masks to be worn in places like museums for even unvaccinated people.\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/06/15/new-york-will-lift-most-covid-restrictions-after-70percent-of-adults-vaccinated.html nYc is open for business! It has been for a while.\\nGenerally, most of the major tourist attractions are open. Do check the websites for specific info such as timed tickets, queues, masks needed, etc.\\nCome and enjoy! You will have a great time. Does anyone know of any other attractions in New York City that have lifted their mask and other COVID-19 rules for visitors besides the Empire State Building Observatory Experience since New York City fully reopened? I do know that The Edge at Hudson Yards no longer requires masks for vaccinated visitors, but the Empire State Building lifted all it\\'s COVID-19 rules for all visitors to it\\'s Observatory Experience. Does anyone know of any other attractions that followed the Empire State Building\\'s lead? Pretty much everything except the Subway has lifted a mask order “Pretty much everything” is vague, Howard.\\nI know the Metropolitan Museum of art still requires masks.\\nEdited: 12:15 pm, June 21, 2021 My best suggestions are 1) always have a mask handy & 2) wear a mask knowing that you can always take it off if a mask is not required\\nEdited: 12:25 pm, June 21, 2021 Most museums like the American Museum of Natural History, Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim Museum still require masks to be worn. . Pretty sure the Empire state building didn\\'t lift their mask rules for all people. They specifically stated that they are following NY and CDC rules, which means unvaccinated people still have to wear masks there. For fully vaccinated people masks at some places are optional, so that is probably what the ESB is doing. There are still a number of stores and locations that require everyone to wear masks indoors. Again though the only people eligible to go maskless indoors in public places are fully vaccinated people.\\nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-covid-19-restrictions-lifted-70-adult-new-yorkers-have-received-first\\nEdited: 6:27 pm, June 21, 2021 Macy\\'s in Flushing has door signs that masks are recommended rather than required. However, almost everyone in Flushing wears a mask on the sidewalk. While the mask advice has been lifted for vaccinated persons outdoors, nothing seems to have changed here and one feels awkward doing otherwise. The Empire State Building making masks optional for visitors was in line with city and state guidelines for COVID-19.\\nhttps://www.theautochannel.com/news/2021/06/16/1011799-empire-state-building-fully-reopens-observatory-experience-with-interactive-exhibits.html #7 - For fully vaccinated people only\\nhttps://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/NYS_CDCGuidance_Summary.pdf\\nBusinesses are authorized to require masks and six feet of social distancing for employees and/or patrons within their establishments OR adhere to CDC guidance, which advises that fully vaccinated individuals do not need to wear masks or be socially distanced, but unvaccinated individuals must continue to wear masks and be socially distanced in most settings.\\nThe Department of Health strongly recommends masks and six feet of social distancing in indoor settings where vaccination status of individuals is unknown.\\nAny mask requirements that businesses choose to implement must adhere to all applicable federal and state laws and regulations (e.g., Americans with Disabilities Act)\\nThis provision applies across most commercial settings, including but not limited to retail, food services, offices, gyms and fitness centers, amusement and family entertainment, hair salons, barber shops and other personal care services, among other settings.\\nHowever, Pre-K to 12 schools, public transit, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and healthcare settings are exempt and must continue to follow the State\\'s existing COVID-19 health guidelines until more New Yorkers are fully vaccinated That was from May 19 and restrictions were further eased on about June 15. #9 - Link from a reputable source please\\nEdited: 10:54 pm, June 21, 2021 https://nypost.com/2021/06/21/tourist-randomly-attacked-with-glass-bottle-aboard-nyc-subway/\\nI had a feeling something like this might happen. A couple weeks ago I suggested to a guy going through garbage bags by my building that instead of throwing the items that didn\\'t meet his standards into the street he should put them back in the garbage bags. In response, he threw a beer bottle at me (but missed). You have to be careful out there and remain very very aware of who is near you. Also, never ever let yourself be the only person on a car, as this young woman apparently was. Move to another car with some sane looking people on it. Looks like bail reform and defunding the police are working well. 😂😂😂. So glad I moved to state that respects Law and Order. My bet is that the DA lets him off. The taser and knife wielding madman who started the stampede in Washington Park two or three days ago was released without bail. For mw, this thread is much more political than tourism related. Am I the only one surprised that she COULD be alone on a train in midtown at 7pm? Is ridership down that much? \"Is ridership down that much?\"\\nNot in my experience. Subway has been really busy every time I\\'ve taken it over the last month. Not quite pre-pandemic levels, but definitely most of the seats fills at all times, and standing room only sometimes, weekday or weekend.\\nThe article says she was alone - not necessarily that the car was empty.\\nEdited: 10:46 am, June 22, 2021 No, forgotmypassword, you’re not the only one surprised! I’m often on the subway WAY out in south Brooklyn and the far reaches of Queens, including early mornings, and I’ve never been the only person in a car. Not even close.\\nThat said, I do scan cars before I enter and head for those with other women and/or people who present as working stiffs (security guards in uniform, healthcare workers in scrubs, tradespeople or cleaners with their tools & supplies…the typical early morning crowd).\\nI also make a point of standing well away from the platform edge (more for fear of tripping than being pushed).\\nI must be doing something right, since in all my time here I’ve had exactly one subway encounter that I’d describe as mildly unsettling. And that’s without following the oft-repeated advice to avoid eye contact or engagement! The original post is tourist related.\\nThese incidents are happening often enough and in areas where tourists are visiting, etc.\\nThose coming here need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there. I\\'m changing my plans to visit in March 2022 to visiting in August 2022. I\\'ll now be adding a week in Florida to my trip to spend time with my daughter\\'s family at Disney in Florida (who are once again having to delay their 2020 trip)\\nI\\'ll be in Florida from 11--16 August 2022 - but I don\\'t intend to miss my NYC fix after having to cancel last year\\'s trip! I don\\'t have any real preference for coming to NYC before or after Florida - will my choice have any impact on hotel prices? It\\'s too far off to compare online, or to check flight availability, but wondered if early or late August made any difference?\\nI\\'ve only ever visited the city in November and March before - are there any Summer events/activities in August (in normal times - remember those?) I should factor in? Will the baseball season still be going on - I\\'d love to catch a game?\\nGrateful for any thoughts or suggestions. Early August hotel prices used to be higher prepandemic because of UK school hols. Whether that will be true next year is unknown. The last week in August was typically quieter in NYC but you\\'d be coming before that. Yes, baseball season will be in full swing. Lots of summer events from outdoor concerts, outdoor movies, flea markets, visit Governor,s island, take a cruise\\nSail-nyc.com\\nKayak or Jetski on the Hudson... New York will be hot.\\nDisney will be hotter. It\\'s also hurricane season in August, but hopefully that won\\'t affect you There are no guarantees, but if I had to choose, I would choose late August. I think the odds of not having totally oppressive weather are slightly better (though not guaranteed). If it is the very end of August, right before Labor Day (first Monday in September) it will likely be a bit quieter because kids are going back to school and local parents may take that week off to help the kids get ready or travel, while out of town parents may be wherever they live helping their kids get ready and not traveling to places like NYC. Business travel is down then too. So quieter and you may get a slightly better hotel rate. I\\'m driving to NYC tomorrow morning for the Immersive Van Gogh Exhibit.\\nI\\'ve tried searching online for answers but haven\\'t found any clear information. :/\\nCan I park outside the city and get a ferry ride to pier 36?\\nWhere can I park? Which direction(s) are you driving in from and departing to? That is impossible to answer without knowing where you are coming from. Where do you want to take a ferry from?\\nWithout knowing where you\\'re coming from, it\\'s impossible to say where you should park. Brooklyn? Queens? New Jersey? If Brooklyn or Queens, you could take the East River Ferry to Wall St/Pier 11. If coming from NJ, you can take a ferry to Brookfield Place and walk across. But seriously, you need to tell people where you\\'re starting from for anyone to know where you should park. I\\'m coming from Rochester, 4.5 hours west.\\nReturning to the same, east. I\\'m coming from Rochester NY. I know nothing about NYC, the subway or other public transportation. Which is why I\\'ve asked for help.\\nI\\'m probably going to park in Beacon at the MNR train station, then take a train to Grand Central Station, but I\\'m having trouble figuring out how to get from GCS to Pier 36. Your \"helpfulness\" could use some work. Like a dash of kindness.\\nIf I knew anything about NYC and its surroundings, I probably wouldn\\'t have to ask for help.\\nBut thanks for the knock down. I was almost feeling good about myself today! If you\\'re driving 4.5 hours back and forth, why not just park nearby? That\\'s an awful lot of driving to then add parking elsewhere and taking a ferry (which doesn\\'t stop at that pier, you would have a bit of a walk from any ferry you were to take). You would be adding at least an hour to your trip to park, take a ferry, and then walk to Pier 36. (google says it\\'s a 5.5 hour drive).\\nCheck https://spothero.com to find affordable parking.\\nIf you want to take a ferry for the experience, here\\'s the NJ ferry site...maybe part in Weehawken at Port Imperial to Wall St/Pier 11 and walk from there. Note: the ferry fare is $13 each way, if there are 2 adults, paying for parking in Manhattan makes sense. https://www.nywaterway.com/ferryroutesschedules.aspx I dont think you can park at Beacon without a permit\\nI would recommend parking at Harriman. The station is right off the Thruway exit 16 (The Woodbury Common Exit) Agree with Risa.\\nCheck out prices of nearby parking on SpotHero.\\nWhen you tally up parking and round trip transit, you may find that you are getting very little savings for the added hassle and time. I would just park in the city for the convenience.\\nPort Imperial was mentioned, but also mentioned as well, it adds another layer. The cash toll into Manhattan is $16.00.\\nLook at Icon, they have garages all over:\\nhttps://iconparkingsystems.com/\\nEdited: 9:54 pm, June 21, 2021 Weekend traffic is a little more friendly in the city (can still be heavy, but no where as bad as our weekday rush hour) so driving in and parking may be easier than you imagined. Especially since you are going downtown Manhattan to the financial district/ seaport area. Parking will cost but you can find a deal. I recommend trying Lunch at Industry Kitchen nice views of the Brooklyn Bridge close by the exhibit or Gigino’s in Wagner Park (a 15 walk from Pier 36) which has views of the Statue of Liberty.\\nIf you still decide the train route you can take 90 to the Taconic parkway. Go to White Plains Metro North Station. When you get to Grand Central can can it or you can take the 4 (Subway) train downtown to City Hall/ Brooklyn Bridge stop, then walk. Also the select bus going downtown on second ave goes down to the Seaport, which is also close to where you want to go.\\nWhatever you decide have fun.\\nEdited: 10:09 pm, June 21, 2021 Hi, never been to the states yet but have booked flights for Christmas this year ( 23-28th Dec.) I have no idea which the best area to stay in over the holiday period is- could anyone point me in the direction of where would be ideal/ central to do all the tourist stuff and also which areas to avoid at that time. Will be a family of 4 with teenage kids. Would help if you gave a hotel budget. Midtown east and just south of central park in midtown can be good. Great transit access, very central, plus access to the park and can be close to the store displays, Christmas events etc. Your budget and type of accommodation you are looking may end up being the deciding factor though. Hi, good thinking. Rough budget of about 250 a night.\\nThank you. Are there five or six of you? You may have very limited options that can accommodate all of you in one room\\nEdited: 3:37 pm, June 15, 2021 Just 4. 2 adults, 2 teenagers. We may need separate rooms from the look of it as it appears all the hotels tend to put two double beds in rather than a double and two singles. They won’t share a bed! 🤣 Take a look at the Radio City Apartments (they are serviced apartments and totally legal, not like AirBnB) which would put you in a prime location for all the Midtown holiday vibes. It\\'s a budget hotel but it\\'s fine.\\nIt looks like the One Bedroom Apartment is available and could suit you.\\nhttp://www.radiocityapartments.com/\\nAlso look into the Affinia properties, there are several in Manhattan, that might be within your budget range for any promo\\'s they are offering. They would be nicer than the RCA but also more expensive. The Fifty and The Shelburne would be closest to your budget and close to many sights.\\nhttps://www.affinia.com/\\nAt this early stage I would be making a cancellable reservation and keep looking for upcoming deals. Sign up with any hotel you like the look of and they\\'ll send you occasional deals and promotions. We will be in town the exact same time this year (Dec, 21-28)\\nThis will be our first visit also. We currently have reservations at the Archer. Would this be considered midtown? Trying to figure out if this is still going on or if it was just a winter thing.\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/cheap-new-york-bargain-events-and-things-to-do-in-nyc?itm_source=parsely-api\\nSaw it here but haven\\'t been able to confirm it\\'s still going on anywhere else.\\nThanks! It was on in January this year and it looks like the organisers needed a GoFundMe to get it going. Not sure about the future options.\\nhttps://merchant.sendchinatownlove.com/light-up-chinatown My family and I are planning to visit NYC during Thanksgiving. One of my adult children lives in a small apartment so a few logistical questions based on these facts: we need two hotel rooms (spouse and myself) and for son/wife and 2 year old. Daughter lives in Chelsea.\\n1. What\\'s a good family hotel near the start of the Macy\\'s Parade Route - 2 year old probably won\\'t last long in the cold and want to be able to walk him back to hotel. We\\'ll go up to $300 per room per night.\\n2. Suggestions for family Thanksgiving dinner.\\n3. Any way to get tickets to the Parade\\nThanks TripAdvisor experts. Some Thanksgiving info from previous years. Last year was different because of covid and who knows what changes will be for this year, but most of the info should be good.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12943017-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k9033640-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12140926-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nFor hotels, look at hotels in the Upper West Side. This is close to the start of the route. A couple that come to mind are the Beacon and the Arthouse. In order to give you proper recommendations for a hotel we need to know the exact dates of travel (hotel room rater vary daily) & your preferred beddomg requirements (# & size of beds.)\\nThere are no tickets for the parade. Viewing is strictly standing on the curb unless you have Macy\\'s or parade sponsor connections.\\nAs for dinner. we need your food preferences & budget/entree as well as location & amenity preferences. Be sure to make the rounds of all the big department stores (Macy\\'s, Saks, etc) for their incredible Xmas windows! I agree you should look at Upper West Side, as that is where the parade starts. I don\\'t know where in Chelsea your daughter lives, but the Beacon is very near W72d St subway station, where the 1 local and 2 and 3 express trains stop. The 1 stops in Chelsea at 7th Av and W23d St. If you were staying closer to Central Park West, the C train stops at 72d, 81st and 86th Sts and CPW, and also at 8th Av and 23d St in Chelsea. On thanksgiving, we went to the Christmas windows after dark and then had a late dinner. Most of the windows weren’t busy at all and we could take great pictures. I got tickets to the seats at the parade because I knew somebody who got them for me. I think they\\'re hard to get if you don\\'t. There aren\\'t many hotels on the upper west side where the parade starts, so I\\'m guessing prices will be high with everyone having the same idea as you.\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nis like apartments, each with full kitchen. Another idea would be to stay near Columbus Circle where the parade turns. The Courtyard Central Park and the Residence Inn Central Park are both near there in the same building with great views of the city. The Residence Inn rooms are small but well planned and have kitchenettes and include breakfast. The Courtyard rooms are slightly bigger.\\nThe Milling a room and Jacob\\'s Pickle are 2 ideas for T\\'giving dinner on the uws. Carmine,s would also work for a large group. PJ Clarke,s has an upper west side location.\\nNear Columbus Circle, Jam inside 1 Central Park hotel might work. In the past, the parade has attracted crowds even 6 people deep. Shorter persons in the back will not see the bands and persons marching on the street. The balloons will be visible unless they are grounded by high winds. Thanks to all of you for your insightful info and tips. Most appreciate it. Pre-pandemic we had been traveling to NYC the past six years and staying in the Hell’s Kitchen area, with our favorite spot being Scallywags Irish Pub. Can residents in the area give us an update on Scallywags, On the Rocks, and safety of the area? We read that Beer Authority had permanently closed and several hotels we have stayed in had been converted to “homeless” placement centers. Really looking for honest review from locals in the area.

The Landmark Tavern is open for indoors. I was there a few weeks ago. I walked to and from there from the subway stations at night and it seem fine to me safety wise. Actually didn\\'t see a whole lot of people at all, granted it was on a Sun night... We are hoping to go Sunday and will need to go prior to noon as there are no reserved entry times available. Has anyone been turned away because they were at capacity?\\nTrying to figure out how early we need to get there.\\nRight now we have an 10am high line entry time and an 10:30-11:30 vessel entry time. So trying to work that out, i\\'m thinking 9am?\\nThanks for any advice on how to navigate those 3 things. I don\\'t know for sure but I would assume that without a reservation your chances of getting in without a reservation are slim to none as this is a brand new attraction so you\\'re competing not only with tourists but also native New Yorkers. I\\'m not saying it\\'s impossible but I wouldn\\'t count on getting in.\\nEdited: 3:03 pm, June 10, 2021 **Right now we have an 10am high line entry time and an 10:30-11:30 vessel entry time. So trying to work that out, i\\'m thinking 9am?**\\nThis doesn\\'t make sense to me unless you just basically want to get to Little Island, walk around a bit and then leave for the High Line. I would get there much earlier. Plus, there may be a line so you may have too wait to enter. You should plan on 8 am. UPDATE: We arrived at Little Island around 9am on Sunday 6/13 and there wasn\\'t a line. Not very crowded at all. Yay! Tickets now available up to July 3 We are going late Friday afternoon, looking forward to checking it out! 9:00 sounds fine. Little Island is basically a small park... I walked around the whole thing in less than a half hour. Highline is a lovely 1.5 mile walk ending at Hudson Yards. I loved the Vessel - it\\'s beautiful! but you will not need a lot of time here either. The Port Authority takes the next step in replacing the bus terminal we all love to hate:\\nhttps://urbanize.city/nyc/post/officials-move-forward-plans-raze-and-replace-port-authority-bus-terminal?utm_source=Urbanize+Newsletter&utm_campaign=1da160170b-news-nyc-2x-week-2021-06-09&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_f2c8779a36-1da160170b-199578530 I have only used the Port Authority to actually board or disembark a bus a handful of times. I have used the restrooms there many times (at least the men’s in the south terminal was revamped several years ago) or grabbed something from one of the food places a couple times. It’s a busy place at all hours, I’ve never thought of it as being better or worse than the other major transit centers, they are what they are.\\nThis is a big commitment to the future, betting that daily commuters will return and grow. Sadly, the adjoining old McGraw Hill Building, an Art Deco landmark, had its lobby torn out at night. It was worthy of Flash Gordon and Ming the Merciless. My union benefit fund rented an office upstairs that I last visited for my pension application.\\nhttps://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-design-community-is-up-in-arms-about-the-demolition-of-this-art-deco-wonder\\nThe Bus Terminal had a number of alterations since its construction in 1950. It suffered from a lack of unified levels and layout. Ouch Fox! Sounds like the destruction of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Hoffman’s Motors lobby that was also destroyed in a hurry to avoid those who would have saved it. More on the proposal https://gothamist.com/news/first-chance-public-weigh-latest-port-authority-bus-terminal-plan\\nI\\'d been wondering how they would keep the buses running during such a big project - apparently \"The new bus terminal would be done in two phases. The first part, expected to last from 2024-2027, would construct a temporary terminal adjacent to the existing one, where buses can run while the main section is built. The second phase would include the demolition and building of the new terminal, which is expected to last from 2028-2031\"\\nI think, from the illustrations in the article, the new adjacent terminal would become a separate intercity bus terminal The McGraw Hill building was designed by Raymond Hood, who designed several Art Deco era buildings in midtown, esp on and around 42d St, including the American Radiator Building,\\noverlooking Bryant Park, and the Daily News Building, on E 42d. I believe he also had some sort of role in Rockefeller Center.\\nI remember when, maybe 40 or more years ago, someone tore down a whole building they weren\\'t supposed to tear down in the W 40s near 6th in the middle of the night\\nEdited: 12:48 pm, June 21, 2021 For those who want to know about the Van Gogh Experience, The Vlogger Sarah Funk went there and took a video\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7WhbtGjlQk&ab_channel=BionicDiscoBionicDisco Thanks for posting this.

Since both of these shows will be in Dallas in the next few months, this video helped me determine that I would probably pass on both of them, but after seeing them both in this video, others may decide that one, or the other, or both, would be to their liking. Thanks for posting, now I don\\'t feel any need to go. After seeing the video, I am sure its not worth the money I saw (The Original) Immersive Van Gogh at Pier 36 on Friday. I liked it. It was beautiful.\\nSeeing Vincent’s Irises bloom on a giant screen was spectacular, almost worth the overpriced admission. I loved looking at my arms and legs covered in brushstrokes. It was fun, different.\\nThe vlogger could have at least learned the correct pronunciation of Arles. Also, she was wrong about there being no information/history at Immersive Van Gogh. There was an audio guide available to download on your cellphone.\\nI go to museums and look at art, too. This was unique. Hi,\\nThe terms and conditions of the NY Pass to cancel, due to the closure of the air frontiers of the US... are not including any chance of refund?\\nIs that so? Can they be so unfriendly to this unfair situation??\\nAny experience to share?\\njosi Josign, thus all just happened, Give everyone a chance to catch their breath.\\nBTW, it is my understanding that the border is closed to Europe ( not UK). I haven’t seen anything about Israel. rdglady, thanks for answering.\\nI am making connection in Turkey. This makes it impossible to make. Reading questions on the air travel forum, people are not sure what happens if you stay in transit areas.\\nI am on Israel,returning to,the US early Wed.AM on El Al. It will be interesting to see how Israelis mare treated.( I’m American) Just to update anyone will arrive to this post: I got an e-mail from NY pass confirming the pass is cancelled, and the refund should take 5-7 days. I hope it will happen.\\nRegards Did you have to email to ask for refund? What is the email address? I need to email for refund too. Thanks >>>Is that so? Can they be so unfriendly to this unfair situation??<<<\\nJosi, i am happy things worked out for you but you really need to be mindful of time zone differences. The travel ban was announced by our President after 9pm (New York time) last night. And you posted at 5:45am complaining about them not giving a refund.\\nWe have no way of knowing where their customer service staff is located but I would assume they are available during “local time” business hours and not jump to conclusions.\\nIt is a scary and confusing time right now. But we will get through it a bit easier if we assume the best of each other.\\nWishing you happy future travels.\\nEdited: 1 year ago I know may seem like a silly question especially for June but I’m a planner. We will be in NYC for a week of Christmas this year (last part of December) does anyone have any suggestions of good weather proof walking shoes for NYC? I mean, this is a very vague question. You can wear sneakers, boots, loafers, etc.\\nWhat type of budget are you looking at? What do you usually wear in cold weather in Georgia? I\\'m glad someone else asked this question! I don\\'t like \"sneakers\\' or \"tennis shoes\" whatever you want to call them and that seems to be everyones answer. I was in Savannah GA recently and walked miles and miles in my OluKai sandals. My feet themselves didn\\'t hurt at all but my ankles did. Maybe that just can\\'t be avoided? I would avoid sandals. Besides being too cold, we possibly could have snow, though that often holds off until Jan. Sneakers (the local term) is what I wear year-round except for business suit occasions. One normally does more walking on vacations and comfort is very important. You do not want to get a blister on the first day that will slow you up for the rest of the trip. Rubber-soled shoes in general are more comfortable than those with leather bottoms. I see women(going off of your screen name) wearing just about any/everything in NYC during the winter. Uggs. Sneakers. Casual boots. Dressy boots. Heels. Loafers......\\nIt really varies.\\nVacation? Wear/bring/buy something comfortable. If you mention what type of \"look\" you are going for, you would probably get some good recs. Since you asked about weatherproof, are you concerned about snow/ice/damp conditions?\\nIf yes, snow & ice are not that common so early in the winter (but does sometimes happen)\\nIn Manhattan they\\'re good about clearing sidewalks pretty promptly but slush puddles at corners can be an issue.\\nIn that case a shoe sole with a texture that enables grip/traction is important. (I wear my Timberland ankle boots a lot) Be aware there can be a lot of salt/snow melter residue that can damage leather P.S. Make sure whatever footwear you bring is well broken in, especially if you\\'re not used to walking a lot\\n(Possibly a good excuse to do some pre-trip shoe shopping.) I wear low heeled Chelsea boots (or any ankle boot) all winter under slacks and jeans. You can find some from Cole Haan and Aquatalia that are waterproof. But even non waterproof versions will work in all but the worst weather. They can be dressed up and down. Sperry duck booties are my favorite fall/winter shoe. Not heavy, not hot, waterproof. Definitely more casual. Good for walking all day in any types of weather though. Thank you, sorry for vague question to start.\\nI definitely have a favorite pair of sneakers just wore for several days of long walking at Disney we can certainly plan to pack those\\nWinters in Ga are very mild so I was concerned sneakers may not be enough.\\nI was also trying to take in consideration if there were snow etc\\nMy plan is to try to find shoes sooner than later for me and my girls so they will be well broken in before the trip\\nIf anyone has a certain style/brand of ankle boot or something like that they like that would be helpful. My girls are 16 and 21 budget per pair anywhere up to 150/200 I wear regular boots - not waterproof, just stylish leather boots all winter, except for when it actually snows or rains heavily. On those days I wear rubberized Hunter boots. They don\\'t really ever get \"broken in,\" they hold their shape. I probably have the ones I wear at least 7-8 years...maybe longer\\nI grew up here. Someone (ok, my ex-husband) once bought me a pair of Timberlands. I wore them maybe once or twice. People wear them if they like them. They\\'re not necessary for the weather we have. I have lived here (except for 4 years in college near Boston) my whole life. I think this fear of snow is absurd - we have it for a day or two a couple of times a winter. The slush could be a real problem sometimes, that\\'s why rubber boots MAY come in handy. Arriving Sunday for 4 days and staying on Times Square. We want to get around to see the major things like 9/11 Memorial, Statue, etc.. What do you think is the best bus or trolley tour which is off/on and goes to a LOT of places? Don\\'t take a bus. Use a van like OnBoard or High Quality. With buses, the best place to sit in on top which can be a miserable experience in all but the most optimum weather. Beem there done that. A;so there is a lot of standing around waiting for the next bus with available seats.\\nA van tour takes a small group that stays together with one dedicated guide. I agree. The hop on/off tours are not very efficient in NYC because of the traffic. If you hop off, you\\'ll waste a lot of time waiting for the next bus. If you just want to ride a loop without getting off, they,re all about the same. For a tour with a guide, this one gets good reviews\\nhttps://www.smallbustoursnyc.com/ It has been many years since I did a bus tour in NYC but we had a good experience with Grayline. However, if you are just looking for transportation from point A to point B, then I would use the subway instead. If you do a HOHO, I wouldn\\'t actually hop off and on more than once because you can waste time waiting for the next bus. If you want to sit back and get a \"lay of the land\", then the HOHO can be fun.\\nI prefer the open top bus (as long as the weather is good), I hate taking pictures through a window. I think the only HoHo bus I have seen operating recently is the burgundy and tan one and I have seen that one several times. I don\\'t know if that means the other companies aren\\'t operating yet or if I just haven\\'t seen them yet.\\nEdited: 11:18 pm, June 19, 2021 You might also want to inquire with companies that interest you about whether they have made any route changes. I live near the UN and usually see many tour buses near there, but nowadays I see none, probably because the UN is still closed to visitors. An Unlimited Metrocard using a NYC Transit Bus In addition to all the previous useful advice, I personally don\\'t like HOHO buses because they spew air pollution, block traffic, break down and cause jams, and generally disrespect the city and its people. Find another option if you care about the place you\\'re visiting, thanks. They\\'re fine for a loop around the sights and just stay on the bus. Go back to the sights you liked later, via the subway, so you can spend more time.\\nI agree with others that they can be slow and frustrating and not to be used for transport through the city. We are flying into Baltimore (BWI) in July then heading to DC, Hershey, Philly, and NYC (in that order). We are renting a car to get around to each city when we land and are staying in different hotels so we are not traveling back to any one city. We are planning on flying back from NYC. My question is, how difficult is it to return a car in NYC? Would it be better to return it upon arriving in NYC? We are not thinking of driving around in NYC either way as we know its not an ideal thing to do. Any advice is appreciated! Don\\'t think you need a car for Philadelphia. Maybe return it when you first arrive there and save yourself some money and hassle. If you are driving to NYC and not going to be using the car while here then it makes no sense to pay for the parking and extra rental days so yes it makes sense to return it upon arrival if you don\\'t return it before that. I agree, drop it in Philly and bus or train to NYC. If you can swap DC and Hershey you can drop the car on arrival in DC as you don’t need the car there either It should not be difficult to return a rental in NYC area, there are 3 major airport, However the rental car companies might charge you a hefty fee And also dropping the car in the city is quite easy. But it\\'s definitely not needed while you are in NY \"\\'We are flying into Baltimore (BWI) in July then heading to DC, Hershey, Philly, and NYC (in that order). \"\\nThe only leg of your trip where a car will be a necessity is for the more rural Hershey area.\\nPerhaps it pick up a car in DC and return in Philly and go to NYC via Amtrak train.\\nAll of the cities have good public transit systems, city parking is expensive and traffic challenging Rent the car at BWI. Drive to Hershey. Drive back to BWI and return it. It’s only about 90 minutes drive time. Or drop it at DCA airport. There is often no drop fee for picking up/dropping off between the three DC area airports.\\nThen you can use the train or bus to go between DC/Philadelphia/New York City. If you have not already reserved a car and have a firm confirmation from the rental company it is unlikely you will even find one to rent. So this may be a moot point. If you already have a reservation your company can provide the info you need. If not...well good luck. Some have been reduced to renting a UHaul truck to get out of the airport. \"If you have not already reserved a car and have a firm confirmation from the rental company it is unlikely you will even find one to rent.\"\\nExcept for the fact that there are still plenty of vehicles to rent at OP\\'s destination. The costs seem higher than normal which is not surprising. The only problem I see with dropping the car bepfre Philly and NYC is our luggage. We already have a car reserved to pick upnat BWI. What’s a good decent Chinese restaurant to eat tonight. $18-25 per person I\\'m of the view that decent does not equal good. Decent is ok, meh. If that\\'s what you want, you can pay $18-25. That basically covers most neighborhood Chinese restaurants in the City. Just walk into the first decent looking place you see. They\\'re pretty much all the same with the same menu. Something like Wu Liang Ye is better than most. Not great, but better than average. Might just barely hit good.\\nGood Chinese is a completely different category and you won\\'t find much at $25 a person. You need to be double that. Places like Pinch, Chinese Tuxedo or Hwa Yuan. For something cheaper, maybe check China Cafe. But $25 a person for dinner will be tight but doable if you order carefully. There\\'s a whole wide world of even great Chinese food but it ain\\'t cheap. One of the finest cuisines in the world and there are some great examples in NYC now. Sloppy, if you haven\\'t been to Silver Apricot yet, you should check it out. I suspect you would enjoy it. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/dining/silver-apricot-review.html I refuse to pay more than $25 a meal, The food is fine, that being said I don\\'t really know the restaurants in Chinatown. Dont let anyone tell you that you cant eat cheaper in NYC chacun à son goût My favorite not to pricey Chinese place is Olliie, on 42nd St between 9th & 10. So much for staying in Chinatown for Chinese. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 9:56 pm, June 27, 2021 IMO Hwa Yuan Szechuan on E Broadway is one of the best, expensive but doable; Chinese food is plated and served meant to be shared — order an app, entree (most include rice), a lo mein or vegetable side dish and you should be within your budget.\\nHopefully they’ll report back on where they ate… Try one of the hotpot places.

My husband has mobility issues and cannot walk any distance. I called Amtrak and requested a transfer chair. Where would I locate that? Understand that the train platforms extend under both the new and old Amtrak facilities. Which end you leave the train determines which building you will be in. The LIRR station is on the lower level of the old Penn Station and uses the higher number platforms. If you are at the front of the train coming into Penn Station, you will be closer to the LIRR area. By the way, there is heavy construction currently underway there and all the shops formerly there are gone. The main ticket windows have also been moved. This diagram may help and gives the locations of elevators.\\nhttps://jasongibbs.com/pennstation/\\nEdited: 5:36 pm, June 18, 2021 This is so helpful to us. I copied out the platform map. So we have a better idea of where we have to go.\\nThank you. Canadians who come to the US with the AstraZeneca Vaccine are not allowed to see Springsteen on broadway\\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/canadians-astra-zeneca-broadway-springsteen-1.6070807\\nthis might be a bigger issue for Europeans as well because the reason is AstraZeneca is not approved in the US and other shows might follow the same protocols That may change. At first, the local ampitheater said anyone who is not vaxxinated against Covid would not be allow to attend concerts but they\\'ve since changed their minds. They said because AstraZeneca is not approved by the FDA , they are not accepting that vaccine.\\nRight now you need Pfizer, Moderna or J&J which are approved. I have no idea why AstraZeneca was not approved A/Z hasn\\'t applied for approval yet. I expect it will be approved here by September/October. Too late for Bruce but I\\'m sure if he comes back Canadians and Europeans will be welcomed to Jungleland Not sure why there are all these news stories now. The information was clearly posted on the SeatGeek website when tickets went on sale a week ago.\\n\"What is the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for Springsteen on Broadway?\\nAll ticket holders 16 years and older must be fully vaccinated with an FDA-approved vaccine (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson) and must show proof of vaccination at their time of entry into the theatre with their valid ticket. The only exception will be for children under the age of 16, who must be accompanied by a vaccinated adult and also must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test.\"\\nhttps://seatgeek.com/springsteen-on-broadway-tickets\\nAlso on the theater (Jujamcyn) website.\\nhttps://www.jujamcyn.com/springsteenfaq/#covid19\\nI\\'m going on the 30th; was able to snag a $88 - with fees - balcony seat :-)\\nGuess he won\\'t be extending as Lehman Trilogy starts at the St James mid September. Lehman Trilogy is going to the Nederlander. American Utopia is going to the St. James Oops, you\\'re right, my bad. Timing is still mid September though. Will we be admitting non-essential Canadians or Europeans anytime soon?\\nImagine many Canadians would find the (currently) mandatory quarantine upon their return home an obstacle too.\\nAs elemental as Bruce is unfortunately I don\\'t think concert attendance is an essential activity @kaye\\nIts also the bigger issue that if venues only permit people with Pfizer/Moderna/ or J&J to enter once restrictions are lifted You can\\'t just fling the doors open\\nAZ is apparently going to be asking the FDA for authorization / approval which would hopefully solve that problem.\\nConsidering the stories about the questionable effectiveness of the Russian and Chinese vaccines the line has to be drawn somewhere Border towns are clamouring to reopen the Borders to fully vaccinated US/Canadians without need for quarantine. No tourist wants to waste precious vacation time to quarantine, specially with the current Canadian requirement for a mandatory hotel stay.

Also, open to suggestions for places with outside seating and great views to enjoy a drink. We are staying in Hell\\'s Kitchen area, but don\\'t mind going to other areas. Thanks! I recommend: -\\nRefinery Rooftop - https://refineryrooftop.com/\\nRoof at Park South - https://www.roofatparksouth.com/ ..... (they estimate a July 1st, 2021 reopening). Most rooftop bars aren\\'t open in the afternoon except perhaps for brunch on a weekend. They generally open at 5...a few at 4. The best views in Hells Kitchen are at the top of Ink48 hotel.. don\\'t know if they,re open or times.\\nThe places I can think of that might have been an option like Rock Center Cafe or the snack bar at the Whitney museum are closed. There are a few bars in the Time Warner building at. Columbus Circle. Don\\'t know hours or who\\'s open. The best rooftop bar in Hell\\'s Kitchen is definitely at the top of the Ink48 Hotel, called the Press Lounge. Wonderful views of both Manhattan and across the Hudson River. Their website says they open at 4.00pm.\\nhttps://www.thepresslounge.com/ 230 5th\\nOpens at 2:00. RH Restaurant. Open all day. Closes at night. Probably the only place in meat packing that does so.\\nETA: Grand Banks. It’s not a rooftop but the view and setting can’t be beat. Also open all day. Just a fabulous way to spend the afternoon.\\nEdited: 8:02 am, June 18, 2021 Eataly’ s rooftop bar and restaurant is open. https://www.eataly.com/us_en/stores/nyc-flatiron/serra-by-birreria/ Thanks everyone for the great suggestions! We will be sure to check them out. I know I specified afternoon but 4 or 5 is fine also. Now - fingers crossed for nice weather!! Hi everyone- we will be In New Jersey for a funeral. Will have limited time to visit nyc; alsoTraveling with person who has limited mobility. We wanted to take a tour of New York harbor sights. Most of them appear to leave from Manhattan. Are there any sight seeing tours leaving from new jersey? If not how difficult is it to get parking and take ferry into Manhattan to meet up with a tour? Or have other suggestions? Thank you! Where in NJ will you be? It,s a big state. Yes it is! Sorry about that -forgot to mention we will be in Linden, New Jersey. There\\'s a ferry from Liberty Landing Marina in Jersey City which gets you to downtown Manhattan (the financial district). I think they have parking., but you have to check.\\nhttps://www.libertylandingferry.com/\\nOnce in Manhattan, you could take a bus tour or a harbor cruise. If you driver further north to Port Imperial and connect with\\nNywaterway.com\\nTheir bus on the Manhattan side will take you to a bus tour.\\nOne of the nicest, most relaxing cruises is the yacht Manhattan with\\nSail-nyc.com\\nThey say they have a departure from North cove downtown which is not farfeom where the first ferry I mentioned let’s you off. If you go downtown there is a free connection bus around the area https://downtownny.com/explore/plan-your-trip/getting-around/ and you could ride the (free) Staten Island ferry\\nIf you prefer a tourist cruise, like the https://www.circleline.com/sightseeing-cruises , then an NJ ferry from Weehawken to 39th street would leave you pretty close to Pier 83 https://www.nywaterway.com/FerryTerminals.aspx\\nDepending on the number in your group (and driver comfort) driving in and parking at Pier 83 (or elsewhere ) may be faster, simpler and not cost more than transit in https://www.circleline.com/about/frequently-asked-questions?locale=en Thank you both for the prompt responses and tips - it’s very helpful! If you\\'re in Linden NJ, another option would be to drive onto Staten Island and take the ferry from St. George to Manhattan. There are some commuter parking lots there. https://www.siferry.com/getthere.html My first thought is Kaye\\'s second option: drive over the bridge into Staten Island and take the Staten Island Ferry into Manhattan. There\\'s parking in St. George, at the ferry on the SI side. Battery Park, on the Manhattan side, is where you can catch tour boats. How much time do you have for sightseeing? Is this a first visit for some of you? Do you have a sightseeing wish list?\\n(Linda, thanks for the confirmation. Once I thought to consult a map I realized that the drive/traffic/expense of using one of the Hudson River ferries was probably not the best idea.)\\nEdited: 7:27 am, June 18, 2021 Where are the best places for sight seeing deals while in New York over Christmas and New year .TIA There aren\\'t really coupon books and similar. And the New York Passes that are advertised generally aren\\'t recommended because they mostly don\\'t include tickets, they give you vouchers that you have to exchange for timed tickets and there may not be any \"good\" times available.\\nThere are theater discounts, though, if that\\'s what you are looking for The Go City Explorer Pass might work out OK. That\\'s a sightseeing pass where you choose 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 sights to visit (you have 60 days to use them, no big deal for visitors) and you\\'ll get a discount off each entry you choose.\\nIf you only have a week or so in NYC you\\'ll have enough time to see a few sights. Don\\'t overload your days. There are many free things to do as well, including all of the store decorations and Christmas trees and Holiday Markets as well as Christmas shopping etc. Many other sights are free such as the Brooklyn Bridge, Staten Island ferry, Central Park, 9/11 Memorial and many more.\\nhttps://gocity.com/new-york/en-us Thanks for all that info. We are there for 9 days 23 Dec till 1st , so looking forward to this trip . Just love going to the U.S We need to go from the Hotel Newton to Yankee Stadium. What is the best way to do this? The 4 train is on the East side. Walk over to central park west and 96th and take the C or B train to 125th street and then switch to the D for yankee stadium. Just look at a subway map. That\\'s the best way to understand how to get around NYC.\\n2 train > 149th St > 4 train > Yankee Stadium. Very easy.\\nhttps://new.mta.info/map/5256\\nYou are welcome. If you have a smartphone, go to the MTA website & click on the trip planner. If you have a smart phone install Citymapper app you don’t have to know the station thats nearby.\\nAll you need to do is enter hotel newton to Yankee stadium , it gives ALL the options\\n. Ter\\'s route is the simplest. Just walk outside your hotel and enter the 96th Street and Broadway subway station. Take the uptown 2 train to the 149th Street/Grand Concourse station. Follow the signs to the platform for the uptown 4 train and take that one stop to 161st Street/Yankee Stadium. I am doing some research on a trip for Macy\\'s parade in 2022. When are packages for parade view brunches usually announced? Where is the best place to look? Google searches aren\\'t really helping as sort of random places are coming up after lots of searching in different places. Suggestions on the ones that are traditionally done/ which are the best experiences? Preferably something with inside view and also choice to go outside and check out action. Thanks! WAY too early to see anything for 2022.\\nI know Rue 57 does something and has gotten good reviews. Just Google Rue 57 Thanksgiving. I have never been.\\nAlso check out Youtube to see if some videos have been posted. Not that many places have a view of the parade route and it is unclear which businesses will survive . (Expecting to pop out into the crowd of usually about a million spectators is questionable)\\nThe https://robertnyc.com/ which has a nice view of Columbus Circle or some of the restaurants in the Time Warner center might be worth a look https://www.theshopsatcolumbuscircle.com/ We did a Macy’s parade trip in 2017 and I found most of the parade brunches didn’t list until less than 4 months out. We booked early and crossed our fingers. And we ended up in a restaurant on the parade route that no longer exists. My tip, though, is to use google maps to see restaurants on the route and contact them directly 5-6 months out to see if they are considering an event. That’s how we found our spot. And it was totally worth it! Looking on input on where we should stay for Spring Break next year (2022).\\nMy kids will be 6 and 8. We don\\'t really want to stay in Times Square. We would rather be on a quieter street in a neighborhood easy to get coffee, breakfast, etc.\\nNear the park would be great, and a kitchenette would be great. A suites with separate living/bedrooms would be even better.\\nOur budget is 500+- a night.\\nThank you! In order to answer your question properly, we need to know your exact dates of travel (hotel rates vary daily) & your desired bedding configuration.\\nEdited: 5:52 pm, June 16, 2021 March 20-27. We are fine with two queens or a king and a pull out. It can be just one bedroom with a small living room. By \"the park\" I take it you mean Central Park?\\nTake a look at The Beacon Hotel and Residence Inn Central Park. These are near Central Park (walkable for a few blocks).\\nOther hotels with kitchenettes you might like that are a little further away from Central Park are the Affinia hotels. There are three in Manhattan. Some are cheaper than others, but the Affinia Gardens is closest to the park and is also the most expensive of the three.\\nRight down in Lower Manhattan is Residence Inn World Trade Center (rooms are bigger than the Central Park hotel). That has kitchenettes and is the furthest away from the park but has great access to other sights such as the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Staten Island Ferry etc. A subway ride will get you up to the park in half an hour or so.\\nBecause you have such a long time until your trip I would suggest signing up with hotels you like and they\\'ll send you deals occasionally. Don\\'t lock anything in yet. If you can live without a kitchenette, go with Arthouse, Great location to Central Park, the subway, lots of great restaurants, shops, coffee...I like staying in non-chain hotels in cities with lots of interesting hotels to offer.\\nSee if you can get the Skyline Penthouse https://www.arthousehotelnyc.com/rooms/skyline-penthouse\\neta- oops, no separate bedroom sleep space there. Still worth a look.\\nEdited: 6:54 pm, June 16, 2021 Thanks! This hotel looks beautiful! I think the Affinia hotels might be just what we are looking for. A lot of hotels have very flexible cancelation policies now so I feel comfortable booking early. While the Beacon is a better location for you, the Affinia hotels have bigger, more recently updated rooms and bigger beds (queens vs doubles) in the 2 bedded rooms. The Beacon would be perfect if it weren’t for those doubles, you’re right! We obviously could make it work but that’s pretty tight with kids who kick in their sleep. I am still very interested in Art House though. I’d love to be on the upper west side. But we would be giving up outdoor space and a kitchen. I do think we will book a room with a patio at the Affinia Gardens. Hopefully the weather will be nice in late March. I wouldn\\'t count on it. March is very changeable weather. But you could get lucky. Hello, I was just wondering if there\\'s been any word on when/if The Polynesian will be opening back up? We\\'re spending a few nights in NYC in September and would like to go there again. I\\'m travelling from Midwest to laguardia in late September where\\'s the best place to stay in New York to visit the world trade centre site and time square would like king size bedding. Budget is 2 to 3 hundred a night? Somewhere that also has good restaurants nearby. Thanks Adam Williams. Without knowing your exact dates, take a look at the Residence Inn Downtown / World Trade Center. Rooms are big and you have a kitchenette. They used to also provide a hot and cold buffet breakfast (pre-covid).\\nIt\\'s very handy to all of the sights there, plus great access for subway to go uptown. You will need to use the subway to travel between those two sights. If it were me, I would stay in either Financial District. Several hotels near-ish to WTC and those are typically near a bunch of subway lines as well. Or possibly in Tribeca as well. From Tribeca, it\\'s easy to walk to WTC and train to Times Square. Lots of great restaurants in Tribeca. A bunch of them in Financial District as well.\\nETA: Aynat gave you a good advice on one of the hotels that is good in the area. Good sized rooms, near WTC. and near a bunch of subway lines.\\nThis is based on MY preference, since I really do not like the idea of staying near Times Square. I always visit since one of my preferred activities is going to a musical or a play., and going one evening to see the nean ligths clearly is one of those iconic things to do. But (and this is during normal, non-pandemic times) I find Times Square to be a bit too frantic for my liking with the crowds. Financial District can be crowded too at times, but it *feels* less frantic to me at least.\\nEdited: 6:15 pm, June 17, 2021 Thanks everyone for the answers to my questions. Were traveling to laguardia airport to visit the Brooklyn bridge the world trade center and times square where is a good central location to stay. Is it best to take a cab to hotel with luggage? Thanks Adam Williams Do you have a budget?\\nin your other thread you were given good advice:\\n\"Also, to help people recommend a hotel for you, please put the dates you are in NYC (prices vary quite a bit by date), your desired budget and bedding configuration.\"\\nIt would be helpful to follow the advice. It would also be polite to thank Autumn Huntress for sending you to the proper forum -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request. The author may repost if desired.\\n\\nPosts on the Tripadvisor forums may be edited for a short period of time.

Not all of these areas have hotels (West Village may not).\\nOtherwise, staying either uptown or downtown and taking the subway when you want to go to the other area is an option. It really all comes down to budget because hotel rates change day by day and time of year. Look at Financial District if you want to stay near BB and WTC, otherwise look at Midtown for hotels near Times Square.\\nMake sure you check reviews and also ask on here about any hotels you like.\\nYes, taking a taxi from the airport is the easiest with luggage. Or book a car service, look into Dial 7.\\nEdited: 6:08 pm, June 17, 2021 Can you stand outside of the Today Show or is it still closed bc of Covid? Hard to find info online. Have you watched to see if people are out there? I looked everywhere online as well. I work late in the day so I usually don\\'t watch it. I\\'ll do that tomorrow! Thanks! I walk by the the studio pretty regularly in the morning going to work. There has been a small group of people standing in front of the windows. Haven\\'t been by in the past week, but before it looked like there were more security than spectators. I saw that, bbb, but hard to tell if it is current or not What makes me think that it is not as it used to be on the plaza is that you used to have to register to go and I don\\'t see the link on the Today Show website anymore. I think they are starting to open up the plaza again. I was watching this morning and they had people on the plaza for the start of the summer concert series. They did say that everyone was vaccinated for Covid. I don\\'t think you have to register anymore. I was there in 2019 and you only had to go through a security check. August trip for a couple Mets games. Will most likely just drive there on a Thursday evening. Friday is unplanned for now but will probably hang out in Manhattan midtown or Lower Manhattan.\\nSaturday night game at Citi Field.\\nSunday will want to visit the cemetery next to Flushing Meadows to visit relatives and then drive home Sunday evening.\\nQuestion.... Any thoughts about staying more towards Queens with easy access to the #7 or stay in Manhattan? IMO depends on budget and parking\\nIf you are driving from and returning to the north (?) Queens is certainly an option\\nThere is a cluster of hotels in convenient walking distance to the Queens / Queensboro Plaza subway stations for easy access to Manhattan via multiple subway lines and some near the Flushing terminus of the 7 https://new.mta.info/map/5256\\nNot all have parking but garages in Queens will be less expensive than Manhattan We\\'ve enjoyed a few stays at the Laguardia Sheraton, which is right in \"downtown\" Flushing (not on airport property).\\nClose to CitiField and to the end of the 7 line, with great access to midtown Manhattan Thanks for the quick replies.\\nYes, driving in from Southern NH with a stop in New Haven for some pizza.\\nBudget is not a concern but would prefer to not spend an obscene amount for hotel parking. (Anything above $0 is an obscene amount, btw) I think it\\'s a budget issue (although maybe lots of people think the same as you and prices will be high) and personal preference question. I don,t know every hotel in Queens near a 7 train but I can tell you they mostly won,t be as nice as Manhattan hotels. The Hyatt Place Flushing has the most amenities and is near Citifield. The Hyatt Place in Long Island City is closer to Manhattan. Frankly I see no reason to stay there unless it\\'s much less expensive and that,s your objective. I\\'d recommend you give some more thought to where your non-baseball activities will be and do some map browsing & comparison pricing of hotels and parking with that in mind to help you decide\\nFew hotels have parking so use Best Parking, Spot Hero or Icon parking to locate/comparison price. Another option, assuming you\\'re traveling fairly light, could be to park in Queens and take the subway to a hotel and the game Rereading your plans, maybe stay in Manhattan for 2 nights and then move to a hotel near the game(s) and the cemetery? About the only hotel that has a little bit (maybe 6 spaces) of free parking is the La Quinta in Sunnyside near the 33rd/Rawson stop on the 7 train https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/laquinta/long-island-city-new-york/la-quinta-inn-queens-new-york-city/overview OK area, nothing special. Not sure about the hotel quality\\nEdited: 1:33 pm, June 17, 2021 Nywhiz-\\nYeah… I wasn’t thinking that as well, as much as I despise moving hotels for such a short trip.\\nBut it does make sense.\\nThx again. It would make your Sunday exit much easier.😉 There are two new major hotels in Flushing whose openings were put off from last year. They are the Hotel Indigo and the Flushing Renaissance Hotel at the Tangram (Marriott). The second will open in August, I am not certain about the first. Camping is an experience that many people are fond of because the beauty of nature is undeniably inspiring. They want to explore the wilderness by getting away from bustling cities. However, for some people, the idea of trekking in the rugged wilderness may be too much. They want to explore nature but while staying in their comfort zone. This is where glam camping enters, sometimes also called glamping. It is a luxurious way to sleep under the stars while also enjoying the comforts of home.\\nEverything is prepared for you beforehand, so you must visit and enjoy the wilderness. Nowadays, glam camping can be experienced anywhere in the world. These days, it is the vacation that everyone is talking about. Here are a few reasons why you should prefer glam tent camping.\\nReasons to prefer glam camping:\\n• Comfortable\\nWhen you are glamping, forget the camps that you must set up yourself with much difficulty and instead step into tall glamp tents that have enough room for you to move about. Camping may be fun but nobody enjoys the roughness. However, glam camping is enjoying the wilderness without the roughness. You are treated with hotel-like hospitality where your comfort is the top priority.\\n• Locations\\nGlamping takes you to such exotic locations where resorts and hotels cannot. The glamp outdoor camps let you wake up before the perfect view of a beach or a mesmerizing mountain range. You are immersed in nature as soon as you get out of your glamp tent. The glamping places are an absolute treat. It is a vacation that is now present in all corners of the world.\\n• Pocket Friendly\\nThe cost of hotels and resorts is much more than the cost of glamping. To live luxuriously in a glam camp, you will not have to break your bank as it usually can be enjoyed at a low budget. Search up “glam camping near me” and you will find many glam camping places in areas you want to travel to. To spend on lamping is like supporting small businesses. You get a chance to directly support the local community and their economy.\\n• No Camping Skills Required\\nYou do not need to be an expert in camping for glam camping. All the kinks are sorted out before your arrival. Moreover, unlike camping, no additional equipment is required in glamping. You can enjoy the vacation even if you do not have scout skills. Just simply enjoy the outdoors.\\n• Eco-Friendly\\nGlamping does not only let you appreciate nature but also protects and preserves the ecosystem. Usually, vacations include large resort chains that negatively impact nature as they are difficult to operate. Although, glamping can be arranged anywhere, even with reusable living arrangements. Ideally, the setups involved in glamping run on solar power or wind energy. Glamping is the perfect way for a sustainable vacation.\\nThere is no better way to explore Mother Earth than to immerse yourself in the beauty of its nature. You even get a chance to closely enjoy different cultures with glam camping. Winner of the weirdest post of the day. Not sure what this has to do with NYC Probably a set up for advertising >>You even get a chance to closely enjoy different cultures with glam camping.<<<\\nEven. Wow. 🤣🤣🤣🤣OMG\\nWhy not tell us the name of your business and be done with it? There was a piece on one of national news morning shows today (ABC?) showing glamping on Governor\\'s Island. This might be a response to that. Was interesting seeing the fancy tents and the worn down paths and weak excuse for grass outside the tents that haven\\'t been improved on the island since we visited there in 2019 \"Why Do You Need to Prefer Glam Camping?\" To what? Plain old camping? A nice hotel? Perhaps the person who wrote this is new to English language. I might suggest just \"Why Glam Camping?\" (and also explain what the toilet/bathing situation is -- are they \"ensuite,\" or is it like in the army?)\\nEdited: 4:44 pm, June 15, 2021 Whatever the toilet situation is it’ll be glamorous. It doesn\\'t seem environmentally friendly, and certainly doesn\\'t provide the experience of being one with nature, and being self sufficient. It sounds like luxury excess where it\\'s the antithesis of what the experience should be, if you\\'re asking. Ageee @ 9 And besides the name is just silly . Glamping indeed. My wife and I are arriving July 15th at about 7:30am, and I need to get to Time square. I know there are quite a few forums probably answering this question already, but I thought I would ask it anyway. We will be staying for 9 days, so we\\'ll have luggage of course. My question is after reading the forums already I have a few options. I can take Taxi which will cost about $80.00, but I can also take Airtrain to get to the Subway. There are 2 possible locations for this either Howard Beach and take the #A train, or go to Jamaica, and take the #E train. My first question: is it feasible to take the Subway with luggage during commute time. The second question would be what station would you recommend. If neither would you just recommend taking the Taxi. I\\'m trying to save as much money as I can, and don\\'t mind rolling the luggage, but I\\'m afraid it might be to big. Sorry for the repeated question you have answered so many times, but I thought I would take a stab at it. Airtrain to Jamaica (Sutphin/Archer) then E train is usually faster (because the E runs express in Queens) https://new.mta.info/map/5256\\nOn the train don\\'t block aisles or doors. Positioning yourselves towards the end of the train car you are riding in is the easiest way to avoid being in the way.\\nThe transit or cab decision is one you can make at time of arrival. My personal rule is if I have carryon I take the subway. If I have a bag big enough to check, I take a cab. It has more to do with what I can or want to carry up and down subway stairs. But if you can carry your luggage, then no need to feel pressured to take a cab. Just be aware of where you’re placing your bags, just like anything else. P.S. There are doors at either end of the subway cars but passengers are not supposed to move between cars using them. I like Risa\\'s advice.\\nIn the end, the question is how much inconvenience are you willing to accept to reduce the cost. Subway is definitely viable, but as noted, I\\'d be more worried about lugging bags up stairs than about the trains - and the size / weight of your bags compared to your fitness/ strength.\\nOne note. Ensure you use your hotel address vs. Times Square (there are hotels that call themselves Times Square this or that that are actually pretty far away). Thank you your feedback helps a lot. I prefer Airtrain to LIRR (to Penn Station) instead of subway. From Penn Station, take express train one stop to Times Square (or taxi to hotel).\\nEdited: 11:22 pm, June 14, 2021 Cab of course with two, with one actually. Make sure your luggage is one carry-on and one sealed other per person. If you zoom in on the subway map linked above look for the wheelchair symbols to see if the most convenient destination station has an elevator I am with Risa and Panch on this one, taxi from JFK is a flat fee and after a flight, with luggage (even it if has wheels) the turnstyles in the subway can be an issue, so can the stairs, I find that a taxi is the way to go with luggage (other than carry on as mentioned by Risa) So here\\'s the decision\\nAirtrain + subway is $10.50/person (so $21 if there\\'s two of you) https://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/air-train\\nYellow cab is ~$75-80 after tip and possible tolls https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page\\nSO make the decision based on how you feel upon arrival.\\nIt\\'s not a decadent choice to take a cab, it\\'s a question of your priorities at the time. Arriving by road may be more a visually interesting ride but successfully navigating the transit system can be satisfying too\\n(That\\'s what I do - but then it takes me the Airtrain + three different subway trains to get to/from JFK so I can often easily rationalize the expense) I’m looking to visit NYC in November for 5 nights/6 Days. I will be with my partner. Eating out & drinking. Shopping & all tourist things. How much would you recommend to budget per day/night? Or total?\\nThank you in advance. This is very, very difficult to answer, honestly. It will really vary a lot. Someone like me will spend a lot of money on food and expensive concert tickets. Others will spend tons on shopping for specific brands or kinds of things they can\\'t find at home.\\nWhat touristy things do you plan on visiting? Some of these are easy to check prices for in advance. Some will require timed tickets. Others will be free.\\nWhat sort of shopping? (interests, brands or \"types\" of things)? Others will know better how much this possibly could be.\\nHow important is food - what do you prefer? Remember that tax is added. There are all kinds of levels price wise, depending on what you prefer to eat. Alcohol is typically expensive.\\nGet a 7-day unlimited metrocard. Very good bargain. It\\'s valid on subways, local buses and the Roosevelt Tram. Even if your just have 5 days it is still a great deal. I allot $50-$100/day for incidentals & anything over $20 goes on a credit card. Maxi is right, to be able to advise someone what to budget for a vacation, one needs to know what kind of traveler you are.\\nIf it were me, I would budget $150/food, assuming that some days will be a lot less, and splurge days will mean a little over. I usually spend somewhere between $75-120pp for dinner, including a shared appetizer, main dishes and one or two glasses of wine. You can eat for less or for much, much more. I spend as little as possible on breakfast (coffee and a banana) and lunch (protein shake, a salad or omelet), that’s my eating style. I’m always surprised by people who are looking for big breakfasts, but if that’s you, you may want to define your parameters.\\nMany tourist attractions are free (grand central station, the high line, NYPublic Library, Staten Island ferry, and all of the parks and walkways). But observation decks are costly, any tours you take are costly (even free tours require tips), performances, museums, and other incidentals all add up. Many people try to limit to one paid attraction a day (one museum) and then free or inexpensive sites the rest of the day. And shopping of course is totally arbitrary.\\nFigure out what you want to do, and perhaps describe your food/dining needs and people can help more. Alternatively, if YOU are in a budget, just say what it is, and people can advise you how to design your trip to meet your budgetary requirements. I have no idea what a stranger on the internet would eat, drink, and buy shopping.\\nIf might help if you say where you are from so if someone knows both they can say it\\'s about x% more/less for equivalent things. $100/day for food\\n$50-100 for tourist stuff- obviously a lot more if you are planning on Broadway shows. Book must dos in advance\\nShopping? That\\'s up to you. No idea if you like thrift stores or designer stores or something in between.\\nTraveling with a real credit card is the smartest thing you can do. you can eat for $25/day\\nyou can eat for $250/day\\nyou can eat for $2500/day\\nAll depends on your budget and your tastes\\nSame thing for shopping and attractions. Lots of free things to do. Lots of expensive things to do ^^^\\nI love the idea of the $1000 pizza at Industry Kitchen, although it’s not on their website right now.\\nhttps://www.mentalfloss.com/article/92472/5-most-expensive-pizzas-ever-made That\\'s a tricky question. You can get a hotel for maybe $200-$250/night that\\'s okay. We just stayed at MSocial in Times Square area and it was around $200. (I had a groupon).\\nTransportation: Subway is $2.75 each swipe so depending on how many times you use it.\\nWe ubered twice. Once to the Met and once to Little Island. It was $31 to the met and $21 to Little Island. So that can add up.\\nWhat are you doing for touristy things? Tickets to stuff have a set price so you can look that up and start adding it up. Are you doing the statue of Liberty? The met? Empire State Building? Whatever you do, go to those websites and check prices.\\nSo hotel and attractions you should be able to figure out in advance. If you\\'re on a budget of any sort, you then will know how much you have left for food.\\nI had a meal at a Cuban restaurant and just for me with a tip and one drink was $40. Fries and 2 drinks at Five guys was $15. A vegan frjuit smoothie was $13. A hotdog and drink from a truck was $8. When This question gets asked, it’s usually by people who have to watch their pennies, Otherwise they were just charge up As much as they were willing to spend and then they would stop.\\nI agree with this as a guide from wren @post 5 . I think it makes sense and is doable:\\n>>$100/day for food\\n$50-100 for tourist stuff- obviously a lot more if you are planning on Broadway shows. Book must dos in advance.\\nShopping? That\\'s up to you...<<< I am looking at taking the bus a few times when in the city next week. Via google earth I have been able to find the signs that show where the bus stop is for most of the buses I will need to take. However there are some, like the M9 bus on Essex near Delancy that I can not see where the stop is. Is there a easy way to know where to catch the bus at? For most instances it will be obvious. You find the sign for your bus,on the side of the street with traffic moving indirection of your desired travel.\\nyou want to M9 at Essex and Delancey- where are you going ?\\nDo you have a travel app? Sounds like you need one. Look at the section \"Where the Bus Stops\" in the info Kaye linked in #2. Also note that bus stops sometimes change, usually temporarily, due to construction or roadworks, in which case the bus sign is usually removed and (hopefully) a notice put up telling where stop has moved to. And as always - if you’re not sure where the stop is, or if it’s the right stop for the bus you need, don’t hesitate to ask. People are (mostly) eager to help…I think tourists are sometimes more reluctant to ask than locals are (or maybe you just come better prepared). In my experience, locals ask about trains and buses *all the time.* In general, bus stops are placed beyond the intersection so those for the other direction will not be directly opposite, but on the other side of the intersection. Stops are usually well marked with signs and sometimes shelters. Formerly, timetables were displayed at the stops, but these have been replaced with a cell phone service. Maybe the Essex / Delancey bus stops are confusing because the Northbound and Southbound stops aren\\'t on the same block.\\nAlso, the bus symbols aren\\'t accurately placed (I\\'m looking at Google maps on my phone.) The Southbound stop is farther south of Delancey outside 81 Essex St, just about opposite the mid block entry to the Essex Market. The Northbound stop is a bit more north of Delancey, almost mid block; try 116 Essex St in Google maps and look at streetview, you might have to rotate the view to see the bus stop.\\nI\\'ve found it\\'s not at all uncommon for Google maps locations to be off. I\\'ve noticed that some stops are hard to see on Google Street View and also the imagery dates can also be old. Look around intersections as they will be close to them (generally right before the intersection by direction of travel). Just something I got used to and realized they are easily seen when there in person than seeing them via Google... Once on the bus are the stop buttons well designated and do you hit it when you have left the most recent stop? They\\'re well designed. Some have those buttons you push. Some have \"cords\" (those are by the window seats) that you pull to indicate that you\\'re going off at the next stop.\\nI tend to use the local buses a lot. Big help for my mobility issues. I too use google maps to do some research. Another helpful tool on the MTA website is the bus schedules. Not so much for the actual bus times, but because they have a generic map of the bus route and that\\'s been helpful sometimes in finding a bus that suits my plans for the day. Hi, we\\'re two guys (he\\'s my brother in law) for his first visit to NYC. I\\'ve been before with my wife.\\nGoing to do the normal touristy things and we\\'re both pretty fit so walking and getting around isn\\'t any trouble. Don\\'t need luxury hotel hence this choice. Probably only two issues:-\\nEasy access to subway.\\nAs we like a beer or two a few bars close enough to stroll to would be great.\\nWhich would you say is the best choice? By the way we\\'re travelling next May for 5 nights and the Dylan is around $150 more expensive. Since you\\'ve been before, were there any areas that you liked when you were in town?\\nBoth are near subway stations so you\\'re fine in that regard. I personally prefer other areas.for hanging out and having a drink in the evenings - but that\\'s me. You\\'ve been before so I figure you\\'ve at least passed by the area where one or both hotels are to have a feeling for the areas?\\nI like areas such as East Village, Union Square, Greenwich Village, Tribeca etc further south for places near many good restaurants and places to stop by for a drink. Those are really random, and divergent, choices to be settling on, 11 months in advance. Why those 2? How are you searching? Thanks guys.\\nOn a previous visit I stayed at the Kitano so I\\'m familiar with that area.\\nIn terms of choice cost has been an important element; we can\\'t justify spending lots for a room we\\'ll hardly be in. In terms of timing we\\'ve only recently decided on the visit and would like to have something in place now and be able to cancel and rebook if necessary.\\nI\\'m intrigued by the areas for hanging out for a drink. This is an important part of the trip as we\\'re very good friends as well as related and love hanging out together. If someone can suggest a reasonably priced hotel in one of those districts with easy access to the subway I\\'d be very graeteful. Haven\\'t looked at rates for next year, but I\\'ve seen some good rates for Moxy East Village and The Frederick (Tribeca) for some tentative dates this year. Any thoughts on Walker Hotel Greenwich Village in terms of local bars etc. Very good location. Near all the restaurants and bars in the Union Square, Greenwich Village and East Village areas. Don\\'t know anything about the particular hotel, but the location is terrific in my opinion. The Walker is in a great location for bars and restaurants but rooms are really small. The Dylan is a 5 min. Walk from the Kitano so you know that area. The Wollcott has been a budget hotel for a while. Their rooms are bigger (they even have rooms with 2 separate sleeping areas, but otherwise, I see no reason to stay there. Thanks Nywhiz,\\nSmall rooms may not be a problem but I’d welcome alternate suggestions. Since you say budget is the deciding factor, I have no idea what prices you,re seeing for your dates. Prices fluctuate. If you don,t mind small rooms, book the Walker. Think I may well just do that, by the way budget probably $250 -$300/ night/room.\\nI know that’s limiting but we’re travelling onto San Francisco then Las Vegas so trying to keep costs to a reasonable level.\\nI think I agree Greenwich Village would suit us as a neighbourhood to stay in; it sounds great.\\nThanks for all the advice guys. We are coming in for a few days towards the end of June and staying at the Courtyard By Marriott New York Manhattan/Chelsea (West 30th btw 6th & 7th Ave.). Assuming it\\'s open, tough to confirm that.\\nI was hoping to get a few recommendations for local restaurants for mainly dinner but maybe some lunches. I think there are a couple bagel places nearby so I should be good for breakfast.\\nWe like reasonably priced places, ethnic is good, pizza will always work but don\\'t think I\\'ll be allowed to have pizza at every meal.\\nThanks! Not my favorite area for good food, but L\\'Amico is very good and fairly reasonable. It will be helpful if you define \"reasonable\" in $, This thread is about places centered 2 blocks away from your location\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13579233-New_York_City_New_York.html Thanks! Lots of ideas in the thread.\\nI\\'d say around $25-30 for an entrée is reasonable but it\\'s New York so may need to raise that. For pizza, Suprema Pizza near Penn station. Ayza Wine and Chocolate bar. Keen,s steakhouse is not reasonable but a historic NYC steakhouse in that area. The pictures for Suprema are making my mouth water!!\\nThis looks beyond perfect!!\\nThanks! Are there any good places for breakfast around mid town manhatton Lots of them.\\nSpecific questions and specific topic titles get specific answers.\\nDo you have a type of place in mind? Good can mean \"fancy\" or \"tasty\" or \"old-fashioned\" or lots of things.\\nMid-town has different meanings to everyone, too\\nSkim the board to see the questions that get lots of answers Also, what is your budget/person? A more specific question title would help too. \"New York City\" is rather vague. Every question has to do with New York City in some respect. Yes there are many breakfast restaurants in Midtown. And its is a big area.\\nYou’ve got to pin it down a bit.\\nI prefer to use Yelp.com and search on my own,then I can read reviews, see prices, pictures and make up my own mind.\\nYelp is current about which restaurants are open since the pandemic.\\nEven on Yelp you’ll have to specify Midtown West or midtown east.\\nSearch “breakfast “ and then enter the Ave. or street and cross street if you\\'ve got that.\\nEdited: 2:54 pm, June 16, 2021 We will be staying on lexington avenue 51st Street.. we like either sit down or take away , budget not to expensive and open to most things too eat Ess- A- Bagel is around the corner on 3rd Ave. it,s counter service for take away but they have a few tables. It,s VERY popular and you will see lines. Little Collins is an Aussie coffee place. Ground Central for coffee and pastry or rolls. Nice atmosphere with comfy couches. Irving Farm and the Midtown diner (155 east 55 st.) are apparently closed but might reopen. Please define \"not too expensive\" in $. Somewhere between 10 and $20 Thank you for that that\\'s very helpful New York Luncheonette is near your location. ill be visiting nyc this summer and trying to do some ‘not-touristic’ things such as go to comic store like a kid from US commonly do, play some arcade (if exist), or even just visit costco (which i think is unique compared to my country Indonesia), or simply see some skate park, or any other fun activities. Thank you people stay safe and have a nice day! This website of off the beaten track things to do might help\\nhttps://www.wanderlustingk.com/travel-blog/secret-new-york\\nEdited: 6:14 am, May 06, 2021 Perhaps also book your hotel in an interesting area. Sounds like you might like East Village or Lower East Side for example. Lots of interesting areas in the other boroughs outside of Manhattan as well.\\nTake a self-guided walking tour of the Bushwick collective in Brooklyn to see some street art? There are guided walking tours too of course but perhaps you think that is too touristy?\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/bushwick-graffiti-bushwick-collective/ Want something REALLY anti-mainstream / want to connect with the community?

From my research it appears that we will need to use our metro card at the designated machine at the stop to purchase a \"ride\" which will give us a receipt and that receipt is what we give to the bus driver. Is that the only difference between that type of bus and the other ones that run in NYC? You don\\'t give receipt to bus driver. You keep it in case anyone, like inspector, asks for it. Also, since you aren\\'t paying on bus (which is normally at front of bus) you can board through any doors, and there are three sets of them -- at front, middle and back Any reason why these type of bus exist? Read this https://new.mta.info/guides/riding-the-bus\\nThe pre-boarding ticketing and entry by any of the (usually 3) doors permits faster boarding and less time at each bus stop for a faster ride https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Bus_Service Is it true that unlimited metro card cannot be used to buy an SBS bus ticket at the kiosks?\\nIt seems to me that was my experience ,but I’m not sure I did it right. #4 - No\\nAre you perhaps thinking of the more expensive Express buses?\\nRead this https://new.mta.info/guides/riding-the-bus It is not true. An unlimited metrocard should work for an sbs bus, as the first link Kaye gave you describes. You can\\'t share an unlimited ride Metrocard though. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

But FYI, a Metrocard is no longer necessary to pay for individual rides - you can just tap your credit card on the scanner. (It’s been quite a while since I last used my Metrocard, though I’ve noticed that most people continue to use them, especially on buses.)\\nEdited to add…with respect to SBS buses, I always used to use my unlimited card to buy the ticket at the machine by the stop, no problem. What you CAN’T do is tap a credit card or other device on those machines. Instead, you do it at the door - there are readers at each door, which as explained above, expedites boarding.\\nEdited: 3:21 pm, June 16, 2021 Do not imagine that \"inspectors\" never show up by the way. \"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition\" in Monte Python and they do and impose a fine for not having a valid fare receipt. Many of the SBS buses are of a large type that is hinged in the middle to make turns. As mentioned, lack of fare collection on the bus and the three doors reduce loading times. The slowness of buses has been a problem in NYC for years. If you have a valid Metrocard such as an unlimited card, you aren\\'t really \"buying\" a ticket for an SBS bus. You\\'re just getting a receipt indicating that the fare has been paid. It doesn\\'t cost anything but you would need it to show to an inspector in case one shows up. What is a good Authentic breakfast and Dinner restaurant in midtown?(possibly by 28th between 6Th &7th) For breakfast you might like the Grey Dog (Chelsea/Flatiron), on 6th Ave between 26th and 27th Sts.\\nhttps://www.thegreydog.com/\\nThe closer you get to the Flatiron area and NoMad you\\'ll find more places to eat.\\nOtherwise, you really can travel anywhere for dinner, even for breakfast if you wish. I would make a day by day itinerary of where you\\'ll be each day and then work out some places to eat. And also work out what type of food you want and like. Well tmrrw I’ll be in Greenwich Village and then make my way to Brooklyn. My hotel is on 28th st between 6th & 7th so my mornings will start around there and make my way downtown for the next 2 days: I have friends on that block. There are a couple of restaurants on that block, but they say they never go to any on their own block. There\\'s a Greek restaurant on that block, closer to 6th that I once ate at, about a year ago...it was pretty decent, and I believe it has a rooftop. There are places on both 6th and 7th where you can grab a quick breakfast on the go. I don\\'t know any names, I just walk by them, but there are plenty of little quick places.\\nAs for dinner, in the teens and 20s between 5th and 7th, there are MANY great restaurants. You need to be much more specific about budget and type of food. If you\\'re in the Village, there are just so many restaurants to choose from. I ate at Silver Apricot on Cornelia St a few weeks ago, that was really delicious, kind of high end Chinese Fusion. I was at Rosemary\\'s on Greenwich St tonight, Italian (got there just at the tail end of happy hour and was able to order drinks about half price). I was at Llama San on Sixth Ave and Waverly (I think, right around there) last week which is truly spectacular, a top 10 for me - I think they describe is at JApanese Peruvian fusion, whatever it is, it\\'s creative and just so good (and the presentation is spectacular). And I was at Morandi last Saturday night, the lemon pasta is fantastic. There are just so many to choose from.\\nCloser to your hotel, Portale is one of my favorites.\\nEdited: 11:43 pm, June 15, 2021 When are you going because some are opening up soon? Dinner:\\nUlivo if you like Italian.\\nIlili (Lebanse)\\nI\\'m less familiar with breakfast places in that area so no help on that front from me. For bf: https://www.friedmansrestaurant.com/\\nCloseby to MSG Average per plate I’d say between $18-24 pp. We love good Chinese, Italian, Mexican, and Seafood. Here for 2 more days. We’ll be in Around Greenwich and Brooklyn Today. And Tribeca Tmmrw. TIA ilili is GREAT!\\nHill Country is really good BBQ in the same area Minetta Tavern in Greenwich Village has an awesome burger (Black Label burger) and excellent steak. You probably need a reservation for lunch or dinner.\\nIn Tribeca, Tamarind has excellent Indian food. They have a set price $30 lunch. In Brooklyn near the bridge, Cecconi is Italian with a water view. I really like Yves in TriBeCa. But there’s also Odeon, Locanda Verde, 1803, Two Hands, and if you want to walk a bit south of TriBeCa, Eataly Hi, my daughter, my mother and I will be coming into the area in July (22-25) for two college soccer ID camps and visits. We have tours planned at Fordham for the 22nd, and my daughter will be at camp all day on the 23rd and half day on the 24th and then at Stony Brook late afternoon/evening of the 25th. We are staying in Fort Lee - Washington Bridge because the Fordham camp is being held at Manahattanville College due to COVID. So my question is what are some easy things we could do in the city the evening of the 22nd and/or 23rd, the afternoon of the 24th and the morning of the 25th? we don\\'t have a lot of time and aren\\'t looking for something super structured but a decent meal on the 24th and/or brunch on the 25th. some window shopping or city exploring. We will have a car but fine with public transportation to get around. any ideas of things that are open and/or areas to explore a bit. If it matters, we are all vaccinated and have our vax cards. Assuming her camp is at the campus in Purchase NY?\\nFort Lee is an inconvenient place to stay for what you appear to be describing A hotel near White Plains or Tarrytown would be easier access to the Fordham Bronx campus, the Manhattanville campus, Metro North commuter trains into the city and an easier drive to Stony Brook via either the Whitestone or Throgs Neck bridge Are you sure you\\'re talking about Manhattanville College, in Purchase, and not Manhattan College, in the Bronx, I believe the Kingsbridge area of the Bronx (near terminus of 1 subway line)? You never came back but just wanted to say, without knowing exactly where you\\'re staying, it,s hard to offer any options with public transportation. You could drive down to the Port Imoerial ferry station in Weehawken, NJ,, park there and take a ferry over to Manhattan. Or perhaps your hotel can provide info. They may have a shuttle bus to public transport. Stony Brook is quite a drive. I\\'m not sure you have time for brunch in Manhattan. Friday driving out to Long Island can be challenging.\\nEdited: 11:39 am, June 04, 2021 Where would you recommend we look to book a hotel? we aren\\'t tied to the original location yes, fordham moved their soccer camp to manhattanville college so we are there two days for a camp (friday all day and saturday morning) and then at SUNY Stony Brook for a camp sunday afternoon our current hotel does list that it has a shuttle to manhattan and we will have a car...we will drive into the city on thursday for the visit at fordham, then continue on to our hotel thursday evening. So you are driving to your Fordham Rose Hill visit before checking into your hotel?\\nI suggested some alternative hotel locations above Staying in White Plains would make the most sense for the soccer camp. The Sonesta hotel there is near the White Plains train station to use Metro North into Manhattan. The Cambria in White Plains would also work and both have pools. I don\\'t know either hotel but based on reviews, both seem fine. But this puts you further from NYC. I don’t think Ft. Lee makes any sense. Here\\'s the Metro North map http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/mnrmap.htm\\nThe Harlem line has stations in White Plains, Fordham (Rose Hill) and then into Grand Central in Manhattan\\nYou can also avoid a lot of city traffic by crossing the Hudson via the Tappan Zee / Cuomo bridge (I-80 to I-287) I have been looking at the MTA website and I know this route is by means not the most efficient but appears to be doable but can not find a way to verify that it is. My thought is\\nTake A train from Penn Station area\\nAt Jay Street transfer to the R line\\nAt 36th street station transfer to the D line and take it to Coney Island/Stillwell stop Yes, it\\'s doable. As you may have noticed, there are often several ways of getting from one place to another particularly when a subway change is needed. Is there a reason why you would pick one that is less efficient than a route that would include one less subway change? :) I am trying to find the best route that limits the walking aspect. We can catch the A train right out our hotel or we have to walk all the way down to Hearld Square to catch the option that the MTA lists. My thought is why transfering is a pain we might not have to walk very far on those transfers. I don\\'t know much about the Jay St or 36th st stations so I could have a huge hike on both of those. Just trying to look at possibilities... You are making this way too complicated. Simply walk over to herald square which is right near Penn station and take the Q train to the end of the line. The last stop is Coney Island/Stillwell. An easier way than what you suggest in your first post would be to take the A train, make a change at West 4th Street for the D train and avoid one. of the changes of trains in your alternative. Makes for less walking since you cut one transfer.\\nRed beat me to another very easy way.\\nEdited: 3:50 pm, June 13, 2021 You are talking about a distance of like two blocks. I don\\'t recall all those transfer points but you may have to go up and down stairs or whatever. You will probably spend more time walking to transfer. What I know for a fact it is going to take much much longer for you to reach your destination with all those connections and if doing this in the summer the subway stations can be miserable without AC, but the trains have AC. If you take Red\\'s (great) advice and want to minimize the walking to save your feet a bit, you could always take a cross town M34 bus (one or two stops depending on where you start) to Herald Square.\\nAs someone who has mobility issues, I\\'m all for saving my knees occasionally when I know I\\'ll be spending a long day on foot. Local buses can be a life saver especially for the quite long Midtown crosstown blocks. yes and it should be a free transfer to the subway if you use the bus anyway. Thank you maxisweden, that would be better. I had not even seen that and it would work out and it appears the W. 4th street is a handicapped station it appears and might be our best option. Thank you so much for the heads up Or simply take the A train to Jay Street and transfer on the same platform to the F to CI. No walking outside of getting to the A. Thank you ter1413 🇺🇲 that looks good also.... We will be visiting NYC coming up in a week and will be in the city for a Mon/Tue and Wed and my sister and myself will be going around and see a number of places. What I am wondering is when it comes to crowd sizes and traffic and such is there much different on the day? I know right now we are begging to enter post covid frenze and people are wanting to get out but was just wondering what kind of crowds we can expect on a Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday at places like The Edge and Chinatown and Coney Island and Roosevelt Tram and down around world trade center area and other such areas. I suspect crowds at attractions are bigger on weekends than weekdays because of the pandemic. On the weekends locals will be going to attractions etc. During the week people tend to be working so the crowds will mainly be from tourists and I believe tourist numbers are still down especially with limits on international tourism, but the tourist numbers are rapidly rising so who knows. Traffic is likely worse during weekdays, The biggest difference is that on Sunday you can park almost anywhere for free (even Manhattan We are leaving our car in NJ and coming in via NJT and using public transportation and taxi to get around the city. If there are specific attractions you want to see, you should check their schedules. The Met Museum that was formerly open every day is now closed on Tues. and Weds. Many hours were reduced at the height of the pandemic and have not yet returned to earlier levels. There are a LOT of tourists around the WTC/Financial District on weekends. A little less right now than pre-Covid, but increasing steadily. I will be reaching New York during the last week of July, already did the booking at Hampton Inn, Manhattan Grand central for 3 nights and plans to have a touring of NY city for 3 days, Then take an East coast tour with a tour company covering DC, Philadephia, Niagra that ends in Boston. From Boston, I plan to hire a car to cover New port, Maine, etc that would last for another 3 days, and will return back to NY to fly back to my home country. Altogether I have a total of 14 days in the states.\\n1. Considering the pandemic and the peak season how much should I budget for the daily expenses covering 3 meals and other entries for a family of 3 adults, excluding shopping?\\n2. Is Hampton Inn, Manhattan, located in a happening area close to the attractions? Google map shows it\\'s very close to The times square.\\n3. What is the best means of transportation from JFK to Hampton Inn, Manhattan Grand central?\\n4. The package tour which I booked covers the places like Trinity church, wall street, charging bull, One world trade, Liberty cruise, Times square, Metropolitan museum< madam Tussauds, etc. Advice needed regarding subway bookings to cover other places excluding the above within New york. I\\'m concerned about the package. Liberty Cruise, is it a cruise by boat (which company??).. To actually visit Statue of Liberty, you need specific timed ticket for a specific Statue Cruise trip. The Met Museum requires timed tickets, is that included?\\nSo many typical things in NYC won\\'t require a tour. Some will require specific timed tickets to gain entry. If you want a walking tour by a specific area, I\\'d book those individually with Free Tours by Foot, Big Onion or similar operator. Where / with who did you book this \"everything coverd tour\"?\\nEdited: 9:10 am, June 12, 2021 You should also post on the Road Trips forum https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i12567-Road_Trips.html\\nDo you mean Newport Rhode Island? Have you plotted out the road trip on a map? I suspect your plans may be ambitious / rushed.\\nI also wonder about the tour provider(s) you may be using. Many cater to people with a language barrier and provide poor choices in accommodation and dining 1) it\\'s too difficult to answer the budget question. Food in NYC can be very cheap (pizza, a bagel, quick sandwich) or very expensive. Most Hampton Inns include breakfast...at least they did before Covid. It,s impossible to anticipate what entry fees you\\'d need to pay beyond what the tour provides. $100/day per person should do it but you can spend less or more.\\n2) your hotel is, as the name describes, near Grand Central which is mostly a business area (lots of office buildings including some famous ones like the Chrysler building. If you start using google maps which gives directions by foot, subway or taxi you can see you\\'re about a 15-20 min. walk to Times Square or a bit less if you use the subway. I don\\'t know what you mean by “ happening” but here, a happening area suggests trendy and that area is not trendy...and btw, neither is Times Square. Happening areas are south of midtown...flatiron district, Chelsea, Soho, Greenwich Village , a TRiBeCa. But it,s certainly a. Convenient location.\\n3) for 3 people with lots of luggage, a taxi is best. It,s a flat fare of $52 plus perhaps a surcharge depending on time of day and then toll and tip for the driver. Expected pay $75-$80. Make sure to use a legitimate yellow taxi from the taxi line outside the terminal. Do not accept a ride from anyone who approaches you, no matter how good the deal sounds. There are lots of scams. Keep the receipt you get from the dispatcher so you can identify the taxi should you leave something behind or have a problem.\\n4). Impossible to say unless you indicate what else you plan to see (and how much free time you\\'ll have). Probably a pay as you go MetroCard is best. You can load money onto the card and add more if you need to. Each ride, regardless of distance is $2.75/person. But many things may be walkable if you,re good walkers. Btw, 42 st., where your hotel is located has fabulous buildings, inside and out. Here is one site I found that describes many of the buildings from the east side (where you\\'re staying) to Bryant Park\\nhttps://gissler.com/east-42nd-street-walking-tour-of-beautiful-spaces\\nThe website\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/\\nHas lots of good ideas for walks you can do on your own. Thanks for your reply@maxisweden. I did the booking with tours4fun, liberty cruise ticket is inclusive.\\nEdited: 1:28 am, June 13, 2021 Thanks@nywhiz and @Kaye_in_Astoria\\nEdited: 1:33 am, June 13, 2021 If the Liberty cruise is included, is it a voucher or a timed ticket? You don’t need subway “bookings”. You just pay-per-ride or buy a 7-day unlimited.\\nEdited: 2:46 am, June 13, 2021 I have taken both doses of Covid 19 vaccination, any extra measures to be taken in NY? What type of clothing is preferable in July weather? Expect temps in 80s and 90s with humidity.\\nDo you have a timed ticket for the statue? Or a voucher? This is important for your planning My husband and I live in NYC and are traveling to Spain in August. We\\'re aware we need to provide negative COVID test results prior to departure back home, and I want to book the appropriate test in Spain well in advance while there are plenty of appointments for all the tests on offer. There are many clinics offering fast PCR tests, but per the CDC website it seems like a rapid antigen test would suffice? I would do PCR but I\\'m nervous that if tourism picks up, labs abroad might get backlogged so rapid antigen seems more foolproof. Can anyone offer confirmation or words of wisdom about their experiences with providing the proper documentation to return? I want to be sure to avoid any missteps. FWIW, we\\'re flying Delta. Thanks! For me, antigen was always working. It was only checked once I checked in for my flight in Europe. You just need a covid antigen test within 72 hours of departure. You\\'ll have to do some research to find a place to do this in Spain, but I\\'ve found Europe is much easier to get a test than USA. Hello - Returning to NYC this summer as a grad present for our HS senior. Staying in the EV. A splurge dinner is part of the present. Point of the steak restaurant is he is on a mission to try wagyu. He also would like a restaurant with as close to a trendy nightclub atmosphere as he can get at 18 with us in tow. I’m not a big beef fan so my steakhouse knowledge is limited. However, I’m currently looking at STK Downtown and Bowery Meat Co. Do either of these fit the bill or not? If not, where would you suggest? Thanks! Bowery Meat Company is certainly good and you will be close to all the nightlife in the East Village and Lower East Side. Your son won\\'t be able to drink alcohol though, the law says he must be 21 years old. Thanks! We live nearby in New England so the 21 yo drinking age is well-known to us. But, I think a trendy, louder place would be more fun for him at this age than old-school steakhouse atmosphere. I will check Bowery Meats for a reservation. If this restaurant reopens by the time you\\'re here, it\\'s a party environment, a big deal, and would fit the bill- go for the late seating: https://www.hasalonnyc.com/\\nSTK is a good fit. Also check out Catch Steak - definitely a hip, young scene. https://catchrestaurants.com/catchsteaknyc/ - I think this is really the one you want to go to. I would put money on it.\\nAlso, I don\\'t know if it would be a fun for you two, but check out Tokyo Record Bar - I dont know your son, but this might be fun. https://tokyorecordbar.com/\\nAnd check out Mr French - it\\'s sexy and sophisticated, maybe too much for an 18 year old, but again....I don\\'t know your son. It\\'s certainly hip. https://www.misterfrenchnyc.com/homepage/\\nEdited: 11:46 pm, June 05, 2021 American Cut has wagyu on their current menu. Don\\'t know how often they change it. Also, I don\\'t know what the atmosphere is like. The area is nice though.\\nhttps://www.americancutsteakhouse.com/location/american-cut-tribeca/#main-courses You\\'ll get the nice stuff at Keens or Peter Luger.\\nFancy and trendy would be Nusr-Et Steakhouse in Midtown (but also quite expensive - even compared to the other 2) Just a note to the wagyu uninitiated. That stuff is delicious, but a little bit goes a long way as it is ridiculously rich. I am a big eater and after about 3 oz, I am ready to throw in the towel. Beginning of the pandemic, my mathematically challenged husband ordered a wagyu strip primal which we still have plenty of in the freezer. Anyway, your boy may be dead set on a big hunk of wagyu, but in the end, it might be better to share a bit of it as a family and then move on to a nice prime steak for a main. Thanks everyone! After much consideration of all the options provided, we have picked CatchSteak. It looks like the best combo of high quality food plus nightclub-like atmosphere. Thank you, Risa!\\nThe rest of the family will be enjoying the wagyu, not me. After trying it several years ago, I had to race home just in time to throw up my very expensive appetizer. Too rich for me! Have fun. Catch is a good choice. Ok, so I booked CatchSteak and this week I read someone was shot to death outside the Dream Hotel, which is right next door. Talk me down, people, please! I feel like we should cancel. My spouse says don’t worry, what are the odds of another shooting happening in the same place? We’ve stayed at The Maritime before and love the neighborhood. Ugh.\\nEdited: 10:25 am, June 13, 2021 It’s terribly sad that this happened.\\nNote that it happened after midnight, long after you and your family would be gone. And while there has been a rise in crime in NYC, the fact that it is happening is newsworthy, because it is so unusual, still. It is not changing my plans to be in that area. As I said elsewhere: just because thousands of people die in their own bathtubs, I’m not going to stop taking showers. We will be traveling in from Philadelphia, going to a Mets game, staying the night and going to a Yankees game the following day and then either staying another night or heading to Boston. We have a minivan with 3 small kids (age 1, 4, 6). We’d like a hotel easy to drive to, fairly easy parking, safe location, and also fairly easy for my son and husband to get to the stadiums.\\nNeeeeed help! As we have never been to NY. Both stadiums are easily accessible by subway https://new.mta.info/map/5256 (Citifield via 7 train, Yankee stadium via 4 or D train)\\nI\\'d say perhaps somewhere in midtown - it\\'s convenient to transit for both games and near to many of the things you likely want to see\\nTo get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired and 3) hotel budget.\\nFew hotels have their own garages so that\\'s usually better priced separately Travel dates 6/23/21-6/25/21. Room with 2 doubles or 1 king & sofa bed, or obviously anything larger. Hotel budget - I’d like to stay under $400 a night. Hotel amenities- I’d like to have valet parking if parking isn’t somewhat near by, and if the hotel doesn’t have a restaurant then restaurants close by. Would it be better to park outside the city and subway in for the two days? If so, any place best to park? And then which hotel would be best/closest near subway? With 3 little kids? Use SpotHero or similar and park near your hotel. You don\\'t want to be shlepping the kids and all your stuff in on trains/subways to save a few dollars Stay in the city. They can get to either stadium easily using the subway. The subway system does not go beyond the city limits\\nConsidering your direction of travel (Philly > NYC > Boston) you\\'ll have to drive through the city anyway There is a Holiday inn across the parking Lot from Citifield, That might work for you. Then you can just walk to the hotel after the game “ #3 of 7 ·\\nWould it be better to park outside the city and subway in for the two days? If so, any place best to park? And then which hotel would be best/closest near subway?”\\nNo, you are best off in Midtown. It’s basically the central point between the 2 stadiums. To stay outside of the city and try to commuter rail in, you’ll be closer to one stadium and to get to the other. You’d have to take a train into the city then a subway to the stadium (or, drive, alternatively).\\nThe best way to position yourself to be centrally located between the stadiums is right in the middle of Manhattan where you can subway to either. As mentioned above, the 7 goes to the Mets game and the D or 4 trains go to the Yankees game.\\nThe 7 train runs through Manhattan at 42nd street. It hits several transfer points, but if you want to really simplify it (take one train direct to each game), the 7 and the D train share a station near Bryant Park, and the 7 and the 4 train share a station at Grand Central.\\nSo, if it were me, I’d aim to stay either in walking distance to Grand Central, or walking distance to Bryant Park (or in between , they’re quite close anyway) so that you can walk to either station to take one subway straight to the game.\\nEdited: 11:00 am, June 11, 2021 I would not stay near CitiField if the plan is to see a Mets game and a Yankee game. Also, it seems that the son and dad are going to the game, so the mom and other children should be somewhere that they can explore.\\nStay in midtown. Unfortunately the 2 stadiums are not near each other so there’s no one good location. If I understand correctly, only your husband and one child are going to the games so you will be left to entertain the 2 younger kids? Is that correct? It matter because you should be in a location where there are things for the Littles to do. One option would be staying in 2 different hotels. Do you think you’d want to do that? We\\'re looking at booking our first trip to NYC at the end of September. My wife and I are going for our 25th anniversary. Not for sure yet, but most likely staying in Manhattan. After the research I\\'ve done here, budgets and travel anxiety, I think spending the cash for a private car service at least for arrival, is the best option. That being said, coming from STL, there are a lot of nonstop options, but all fly into LGA. I\\'ve read the \"Third World Country\" comments and the $8 billion in construcion comments. If I\\'m meeting a car service, is there any reason I\\'d want to take a layover flight to JFK over a direct flight to LGA? Thanks for your time and input. No. Absolutely not.\\nDepending on which terminal you come into, you will either see a gorgeous new terminal or the old one. But in either case, they’ve worked out the pick up situation fairly well. No reason to fly into jfk if you don’t have to. A direct flight is way better than a layover (unless you save a lot of money on a layover that you could spend while in NYC). A non-stop flight is better in my opinion. Non-stop all the way, no question.\\nI’ve also never understood the reason for a car service pick-up at the airport, which for me would add an additional element of anxiety (what door are we supposed to be at? what door is this? where’s the car? is that ours - oops, guess not - oh, maybe it’s that one over there). Sometimes there are special circumstances that override this, like the need for a larger vehicle to accommodate a family. But otherwise, regular taxis are *right there.*\\nI understand there’ve been long waits for cabs lately, because of a general shortage, but hopefully that will resolve by the time of your visit. \"Meet and greet\" type car service pickup is convenient because they know which flight you\\'re coming in on, then meet you at the carousel. I\\'ve used it many times over the years and it works. I haven\\'t used it in years, so I don\\'t know how much more it costs vs. an uber or the like. For a regular car service reservation you must now meet them at designated areas at LGA https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides\\nI don\\'t know if/how this may have impacted \"meet & greet\" service so if you go that route I\\'d ask the service provider for details\\nHere Uber & Lyft fall under the car service rules\\nEdited: 3:41 pm, June 12, 2021 I don\\'t travel much, I go to Cabo every other year and we get car service because it\\'s easy to find and quicker than a shuttle. Figured for the price and convivence, I\\'d do the same for this trip. There\\'s something comforting about a reservation with a reputable company. I know it sounds weird, but, I guess so am I. Thank you all for your input. This should be a good trip. Tony, it’s not weird - a lot of people do it - but NYC isn’t Cabo. I just wanted to reassure you that taxis are readily available, regulated, and safe. Sometimes people who are used to traveling to places where that’s NOT the case assume they need to reserve a car service or shuttle.\\nI sometimes use a car service to the airport, because there aren’t tons of cabs where I live, but I think I’ve only taken one from the airport once (because I had a coupon deal); as I wrote, I found it less convenient than just grabbing a cab.\\nHave a great trip! Riding in a Yellow cab is a classic NYC experience (metered by time/distance + tip & possible tolls and available via a dispatcher line curbside at all terminals) which you might find an enjoyable part of a first time visit https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/by-taxi Is the LGA Connect service still operating?\\nThey charged a flat rate (was $15 for first passenger and $5 for each additional when launched in November 2019) from LGA to anywhere in the city.\\nVery easy to find upon arrival. Is the air train to Jamaica Station and LIRR to Penn back to normal or are there still covid restrictions besides wearing a mask?\\nThank you! You\\'re right mask are still required, but haven\\'t heard of any other continued restrictions presently. If you are you coming in late at night, or early in the AM, I would check directly with LIRR & JFK(about the Airtrain) about service at those specific times.\\nHappy Planning.\\nEdited: 8:33 pm, June 12, 2021 I was on the LIRR, NJT, and the subway yesterday and everyone was wearing a mask, even in Penn Station. However, when I got to my destination on the Jersey Shore, no one had a mask in the town. The reverse was true in downtown Flushing upon my return in the evening where mask wearing was universal. I suspect the local custom will survive the relaxation of rules. I see Macy\\'s changed their sign postings to \"masks are recommended\" from \"required.\" We have not been back to NYC since covid and was more concerned about capacity limits, less trains, or other changes to the actual process that would increase time. Glad to hear masked up and business as usual. We are so looking forward to it and glad to be coming back.\\nThank you! Since Jamaica is a stop for so many Penn Station bound trains (and it doesn\\'t matter which line you take unless heading farther east) any planned work / schedule changes out east is unlikely to inconvenience you in either direction between Jamaica & Penn, it\\'s unlikely to you\\'ll have much of a wait unless traveling at odd hours\\nYou might want to check the schedules just in case https://new.mta.info/agency/long-island-rail-road\\nEdited: 8:16 am, June 13, 2021 I love unique shopping experiences but I\\'ve had the hardest time finding any article online that compiles some of the opportunities available in NYC that are what I\\'m looking for, or thinking of. The examples I can think of are:\\n- getting zapped (welded jewelry) at Catbird\\n- create your own lipstick at Bite labs\\n- create your own perfume at Olfactory\\nBut I know there are so many more than that. Can anyone here help to drop some cool shopping/experiences in the city? Whenever I look it up online I just find articles about chain stores with trendy decorations. Not the same thing. Do you have a price range?\\nI like Dreems - always interesting clothing, independent designers. https://dreems.nyc/\\nAnd Kirna Zabete.\\nBoth are in Soho. If you\\'ve never been, the only brick and mortar store of that catalog you always see on the plane Hammaker Schlemmer, is a fun place to shop - East 57th Street near a really good Pizza place. www.hammacher.com . Those sound pretty cool! I knew about olfactory, but I didn\\'t know about Bite Lab or Catbird\\nBrooklyn Flea is a large outdoor market with several different unique vendors. I like the one in the Williamsburg-section of Brooklyn on Saturdays and you can combine it with a visit to Brooklyn Brewery (also in Williamsburg Brooklyn).\\nIt is the L subway train to Bedford ave.\\nWhatever you decide, Have fun!\\nEdited: 9:08 pm, June 12, 2021 Just noticed the automatic links above are all wrong. Here they are\\nhttps://brooklynflea.com/\\n&\\nhttps://brooklynbrewery.com/\\nAlso the \"Williamsburg?\" that gets linked in Tripadvisor automatically is not the one in Brooklyn.\\nJust FYI\\nEnjoy! Is it safe to walk around the meatpacking District at night?\\nIs it safe for a woman to take a cab alone at night? What ride app is the safest? Can you give some context?\\nWhere are you planning on walking, and at what time of night? Yes and yes.\\nI walk alone home from the Meatpacking District ALL of the time. In fact, will be doing so for my birthday in a little over a week (about an hour walk, maybe a little longer). I regularly walk to and from restaurants at night, ranging in the 9000 to 13,000 steps round trip, per the app on my phone. In the last year, the latest I get home is about 11:30, but that\\'s because of curfew closings.\\nI use regular cabs, Uber, or Lyft...depending on circumstance. Any of them are fine. This is a super busy area with plenty of restaurants and nightlife, especially now, when every restaurant has expanded its outdoor seating.\\nEdited: 6:45 pm, June 11, 2021 Can use Uber or Lyft if you don\\'t want to take a yellow cab. It has a lot of nightlife late at night with bouncers working the door. The crimes that happen down there are more the typical club crimes like drunks getting into fights with each other etc. As long as you use commonsense it is as safe as any other nightlife district in the world. When taking a car service make sure to check the plate to verify the car is the correct vehicle before getting in and in clubs/lounges watch your drinks. There tend to be a number of people on the street coming and going even late at night. Around midnight, 10 min walk from PhD rooftop to the brass monkey. Your biggest danger will be tripping over people. This is not something you need to worry about. There will be plenty of people walking around, just like you. (and maybe me!) There is occasional violence down there usually attributed to club activity -- someone was shot to death outside the Dream Hotel a couple days ago -- not a hotel guest. The incident that happened the other night is the first thing that came to mind, Grandrue mentioned that in #6.\\nYou\\'ll be fine, just make sure you are aware of your surroundings and keep to yourself. You know....earlier this week I did something I regret, cursing out this board all the way....I went out for cocktails with one friend and then dinner at another restaurant and it ran late, and then I stayed even later talking to the chef outside the restaurant for a half hour or so. I started walking home from E 26th St, and I got down past Canal St where it starts to get quieter. It was a lovely night and I was having a nice walk. But it was around midnight and I had some of the fearmongers in my head and I jumped into a cab. Because of where I live, I had to then walk a block or so home from where the cab drops me off, and there were some people out walking their dogs and such. I regretted not walking the rest of the way home on a nice night after an earlier downpour (another half hour) even more than the $11.50 the cab cost - never again. I feel safe in NYC. Like any place in the world, there are some bad things that happen. But just because people slip in the bathtub and die, I\\'m not going to stop taking showers.\\nSo, OP, keep your eyes open. But walking from the Dream Hotel to the Brass Monkey is just no big deal, it\\'s a few minutes walk. It\\'s nothing. Enjoy yourself. As the others have said, MePa is very crowded and safe, as long as you aren’t drunk or stoned and acting foolish Don\\'t know when the OP is coming, but currently there are stunning Floral \"Flashes\" in the Meat Packing district as part of something called Leaf Flower Show, Wish we were there. What is the dress code for weekend brunch at Leopard des Artistes? Thank you! The first place to look is the webiste, which says:\\nDress Code:\\nSmart Casual. Please refrain from sneakers, shorts, flip flops and sportswear.\\nIf it were me, I would wear a sundress and wedges/sandals in the summer. Non-jeans pants or dress in the winter, with heels.\\nEdited: 6:08 pm, June 12, 2021 Thank you so much! cruiselines will require proof of vaccination 14 days before cruising. if airlines were to set the same policy it may encourage more people to get immunized and give people the confidence to travel again — getting vaccinated is our path forward to ‘back to normal’\\n😷 #gettheshot Travel, concerts, theaters, all those things that require vaccination cards so folks can Have Fun will really help us get over the upcoming hump of refuseniks ... and when that is added to required pre- boarding PCR and mask regulation during flight, then we are all set... or would the vaccination proof requirement remove the other two items?

I doubt the airlines want to get involved for domestic travel, they know it would hurt their bottom line.\\nWhat many fail to realize is that not everyone is on board with the level of control that is being put out there. While it\\'s your belief that getting vaccinated is our path forward to return to normal, there are many that do not believe that message.\\nI respect your opinion, but the persuasive messages to get vaccinated are getting old in my opinion. People have a right to decide what they want to put into their body and should not feel pressured to comply. These vaccines do not solve the problem fully, people can still get covid and still spread covid. I could never, in good conscience, be a free-rider on the herd immunity that will hopefully be established through vaccination.\\nTo me it seems like an obvious ethical & patriotic decision to take a calculated risk that not only protects my own health but also to do my bit to protect the truly medically vulnerable and prevent further spread that could produce dangerous mutations that evade the vaccines and extends the crisis.\\nHopefully those who refuse because of religious/philosophical/political beliefs or scientific skepticism will have the courage of their convictions and accept, with dignity, the consequences of the \"no shirt, no shoes, no service\" situation they are voluntarily choosing. ‘people can still get covid and still spread covid’but with the vaccine less chances to be hospitalized or die. It’s not 100% but it’s a good place to start.\\nunfortunately I have a few family members and friends that think the same way. for the holdouts and anti-vaxxers, you should thank God that the rest of society isn’t as self-centered as yiu are — once you’re all ‘grounded’ maybe you’ll reconsider and get a shot in the arm.\\nNo One Is Safe Until We All Are Safe!\\n😷 #gettheshot Springerandy is correct. One fact many people keep forgetting is that vaccines do NOT prevent you from spreading COVID nor guarantee you still won\\'t get it. For this very reason, airlines are requiring a negative COVID test for international travel into the US. They do NOT care if you are vaccinated simply because that does not mean you cannot transmit the virus.\\nEdited: 8:42 am, May 02, 2021 But some people keep forgetting, if everyone is vaccinated then we all have a slim chance of getting seriously ill, even if we do get it. Obviously there is a small percentage of people who are medically unable to receive the vaccine but if everyone else rolled up their sleeves, this thing would finally be under control.\\nEdited: 9:08 am, May 02, 2021 \"What many fail to realize is that not everyone is on board with the level of control that is being put out there.\"\\nWhich sort of control and by whom?\\nI do find the existence of things like the \"Bill Gates put a tracking microchip in the vaccines\" crowd to be problematic.

The reading I have done about the science has given me confidence that the Hobson\\'s Choice here is to be pro-vaccine (esp. the mRNA ones)\\nI do have some concerns about privacy and data *but* those pre-exist the pandemic and concern corporations as much or more than governments.\\nThere is legal precedent for requiring proof of vaccination for travel (Yellow card attached to your passport) and for enrolling in / attending school. A secure, convenient, seamless system will be a challenge.\\n\"I doubt the airlines want to get involved for domestic travel, they know it would hurt their bottom line.\"\\nActually I can picture \"vaccine verified\" as a marketing tool for cruises, flights, performing arts, amusement parks and other things.

New here and planning a trip to NYC. It\\'s our first time and I am so excited. I am sure I will have tons of questions in the coming months. But here\\'s one....what is the best way to get from JFK to our hotel in Manhattan? Don\\'t really want to do subway with luggage and such....I was thinking a car service to pick us up that is reasonably priced. Any suggestions?\\nThanks all! Just follow the signs in baggage claim to the official taxi line. It’s the most cost effective way to have a ride into manhattan and the safest.\\nOn the Top Questions on the right side of this forum page, the first one gives all the ways to get from the airports to Manhattan (public and private transportation) plus costs. You can’t see it on your phone but you can on tablet and Mac/pc. +1 on taking a standard NYC cab(the cars are yellow.) If cost is no option then taking a taxi from the official taxi queue is the way to go, especially with lots of luggage. Don\\'t fall for the scam of drivers coming up to you claiming they are a taxi. Just get in the official taxi line. Just in case people might get confused when they see them the green taxis are official taxis as well even though they are not yellow. The difference is the green cabs are Boro Taxis can only pick up passengers from the streets in northern Manhattan (north of West 110th Street and East 96th Street), and anywhere else in the 4 boroughs (except the airport area). They can drop you off anywhere (including the airport area) in the 5 boroughs. Just to add to what Risa said, when you get in the taxi line, follow it to the curbside. The official dispatcher will be standing by their official stand. They won\\'t try ro pull you out of line & will put you in the next cab - not take you away from the front of the line. There are folks who will give you a song & dance but don\\'t buy it. First time advice.....have the address of your hotel handy.\\nSaying....I\\'m going to the XYZ Hotel probably won\\'t cut it.\\nSaying....I\\'m going to the XYZ Hotel on 57th St between 5th and 6th.....will. Taxi s fixed pricing and that makes it simple. Dial 7 is a good option for a car service. Though I find taking a car service back to the airport is better. Taking a taxi from the airport is easy and the stands are easy to find.\\nMeet and Greets by a car service at the airport are more expensive if you\\'re thinking of this.\\nhttps://www.dial7.com/\\nNote that in the past there were illegal touts wandering the airport offering rides into Manhattan at an exhorbitant cost. Don\\'t fall for this if they\\'re still around. Go to either the official yellow taxi line or book a car service. Hi. Does anyone like me here spend hours trying to find the next suitable travel destination, and despite spending hours, we are still confused as to which country should I visit next?\\nNeed some good forum /website suggestions. Easy. Stop searching. Visit New York City. Again, and again, and again.\\nI think this question is better of at one of the more general travel forums than a specific city forum. Unless it is to solicit specific sites (in which case, this would be spam)?\\nEdited: 3:37 am, June 11, 2021 I thought the same, a setup for a \"stranger\" to reply with some bizarre website to get their name posted here First post in 8 years???? ***Hi. Does anyone like me here spend hours trying to find the next suitable travel destination, and despite spending hours, we are still confused as to which country should I visit next?\\nNeed some good forum /website suggestions.***\\nI never have to think about the next travel destination. I travel numerous times a year, typically visiting the same areas over and over, then one new destination each year. I have new destination ideas to keep me going for years. Search for \"travel\" in Instagram. Lots of pictures there that might enthuse you about a country or city. Driving from Michigan. Wanting to leave car for about four days outside of NYC and take train or bus into Manhattan. Suggestions? Secaucus JUnction , exit 15x on the NJ turnpike is probsably your best bet The Port Imperial ferry in Weehawken is another option https://www.nywaterway.com/indoorparkinggarage.aspx Either of the above, I\\'d lean towards Port Imperial though.\\nIt also depends on your endpoint. Is it out of the question to drive in and park close to your hotel? Amplifying on #3 - what’s your motivation for leaving your car outside Manhattan? You’re definitely smart to avoid driving it during your stay, but garaging it in Manhattan may work just as well or better.\\nIf your concern is city driving - driving into the city can be frustrating if the traffic is heavy (as it generally is), but it’s doable. I actually find the scariest driving to be in New Jersey, simply because speeds are higher.\\nIf your concern is the cost of parking - I’m not current on parking costs, but you may not save all that much by leaving your car NJ. Parking by commuter hubs there is not exactly cheap. We drive in from Ohio and park at the Path Station in Harrison,NJ. Then take the train into the city.\\nTrains go to the World Trade Center or north around 42th St. Around 10 dollars to park per day. IMO driving and parking by the PATH is just as bad if not worse than driving and parking in Manhattan and getting there often involves more city driving than a garage in Manhattan right outside of the Tunnel This question gets asked a lot - and the best answer depends on your motivation (fear of driving in the city, desire to avoid traffic delays, or cost of city parking), your final destination, and how many people (if a few people - round trip transit cost can quickly eat up parking cost saving - if cost was your motivation).\\nSo - if you can share - motivation, destination, and number of people - better advice can be given. Secaucus is the easiest - right off the NJ Turnpike and a quick direct train route to NYC. But it is also probably the most expensive option (cheap train tickets but expensive daily parking).\\nEdited: 4:46 pm, June 11, 2021 A couple years ago someone posted a best parking or Spothero rate in Manhattan that was half of Secaucus\\nEdited: 5:06 pm, June 11, 2021 ***A couple years ago someone posted a best parking or Spothero rate in Manhattan that was half of Secaucus***\\nShopping around is smart. I\\'ve never used the above mentioned parking apps, but have used Icon for a very long time. Plenty of garages and their prices are always reasonable.\\nhttps://iconparkingsystems.com/ My wife will be flying from Phoenix to JFK in a couple weeks and will be going to Manhattan, around Lex & 77th street. She arrives at JFK around 6.30am and will be flying back the same day at 6pm. She will be done with her business around 10.30am and will have around 4hrs to herself before she heads back to JFK. I had few questions:\\n1. Though she is vaccinated, we prefer not to use the subway, so what is next most economical way to get to Manhattan from JFK? I see that a taxi to Manhattan costs $52 + 0.5 + $4.5 (if 4-8pm) + tolls + tip. Would an Uber ride be less or would you rather recommend a regular taxi or some other mode of transportation? I know that going from the 59 Street bridge has no tolls, rather than the RFK bridge, but can you force the driver to take that route or he might say it is too long and he would rather go through a tolled bridge, though from what I see the place is almost equally distanced both bridges? How is the peak time determine, by the start or end time of the trip or the whole trip is considered peak time if any part of the trip falls within the peak time? How can one avoid rogue taxi drivers that might charge not a flat fee, say starts the meter like you are going to a non- Manhattan location, or how to avoid or know if a taxi driver is not licensed and how prevalent are these things? Is the flat fee the same, regardless if you are going from/to JFK to/from Manhattan? How long it will take at 7am to go to Manhattan from JFK and from Manhattan to JFK around 3.30pm?\\n2. This will be the first flight in 15 months, so do you expect to have delays more than normal at JFK to check-in. How much time do you suggest to be at JFK before departure time for a local trip? I now they suggest 2 hrs but we have always done around 1 hr for local trips pre-pandemic.\\n3. Can anyone suggest a simple itinerary of seeing things in NYC that can be done in 4 -4.5hrs? She will be a with a friend and we were thinking to do Statute of Liberty and Ellis Island? Do you suggest she does something else? I mean they can wander around Central Park, Guggenheim, Times Square, Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, One World Trade Center, 9/11 Memorial, Greenwich Village, etc.\\nThe trip is very short and she would rather see several places, hi-bye style, rather than spend time in only one place.\\nIs there an official tour bus that goes around NYC that you would recommend?\\nDo you recommend taking a tour to go to Ellis Island and Statute of Liberty or just take the ferry at her leisure? Where can we get information on tickets and timetable of the ferries to/from both islands? Are they open now and is it too crowded in the ferries?\\nAny info will be greatly appreciated. 1) At the airport use *only* the Yellow cab dispatcher line https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page The on-screen rate message should read \"Rate #2- JFK Airport.\" Flat rate applies in both directions. Ignore any touts offering (illegal) rides.\\nYou may specify the route but avoiding a toll during rush hour may not be the best use of her or the drivers time https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/yellow-taxi-passenger-bill-of-rights.page\\nApparently Uber rates and wait times have gone up\\n2) no idea\\n3) What are her sightseeing priorities?\\nShe does not have time to visit Liberty & Ellis Islands (Which has always required timed tickets)\\nShe could take a cab downtown and ride past some of the things you mentioned, see the SOL from Battery Park and then wander a bit https://downtownny.com/explore/plan-your-trip/must-see-downtown/ 1). Hard to predict traffic.\\n2). Air travel is back to pre-pandemic levels at times. I saw a story earlier this evening on our local news mentioning this. The reporter was at Newark Airport and it was packed. In my option, one hour earlier is cutting it close. I always arrive to the airport 2 hours earlier.\\n3). 4 to 4.5 hours isn\\'t a lot. I would not recommend the SOL/EI, it\\'s a timed ticket and deserves nearly that much time. You have way too many things for a short period of time. One can spend that amount of time in Central Park alone. Also, only Statue Cruises goes to Liberty Island and Ellis Island, any other cruise is going by the statue. Statue Cruises site is here:\\nhttps://www.cityexperiences.com I\\'ve seen stories abut shortages of TSA agents and we know air travel has resumed so I wouldn\\'t assume it will be the same amount of time to clear security as before, especially if there is a lack of TSA which can lead to longer lines. Maybe track security clearance times at the airport leading up to the trip to get an idea. With limited time and all the car service/taxi issues lately I would probably just go for a yellow cab because its flat rate so you dont need to worry about surge pricing kicking in etc. You can also call a car service and book a car ahead of time and see what they charge.\\nIn terms of things to do it depends on what she is interested in. She would be like a 10-15 minute walk to the MET, central park. The Guggenheim and frick are also in walking distance. With such limited time it probably makes sense for her to focus on only one or two neighborhoods. If she just wants to walk around she could walk over to the park and then head south down past rock center and times square down to empire state building/herald square/macys etc. When it is time to return to the airport she could just take the LIRR from Penn station to Jamaica and then take the air train to the terminal. I wouldn\\'t mess around with a car on the way back to the airport because who knows what the traffic situation will be. 1. A taxi/Uber is not the most economical, but if you go that route, simply get on the line outside and wait. The fare...with...toll/tip should be approved $75 -$80.\\nDon\\'t force the driver to take a specific route. They have been driving around all morning and there may be traffic/an accident/police activity in the vicinity of the route that you suggest. Just give your destination and they will get you there.\\nDon\\'t overthink the \"rouge\" driver thing. If you are on the official taxi line, the drivers are licensed.\\n2. I would be at the airport 2 hours prior for a domestic flight.\\n3. What day of the week is this? Is this her first visit to NYC?\\nI would not suggest going to the SoL with only 4 hours. I would not take a tour bus. I would also not suggest a museum. Too short a time in NYC and if the weather is nice, stay outside.\\nI would start around Central Park and head down through Times Sq. and Bryant Park. Then maybe walk to get a view of the Empire State Building. Lunch. Then head down to the 9/11 Memorial.\\nThe other option is to check out Grand Central. After that, back to JFK. That honestly isn\\'t alot of time.\\nNo way are 9/11, One World, SOL or Ellis Island feasible. Lower Manhattan is nowhere near 77th - even the parts of it that don\\'t include a ferry ride. I\\'d put the Village in that category too. I\\'m on the fence about Times Square or the Empire State, since her flight out is something she really has to make sure she doesn\\'t miss.\\nCentral Park would be good. I believe the Frick Collection is open again, so that would be perfect if she\\'s into art and/or mansions of the rich and famous. If she\\'s a walker, the Guggenheim would be doable (full disclosure - it\\'s not a favorite of mine and I find the building much more interesting than the actual art collection. Went once to see it but wouldn\\'t need to go again). She\\'ll also be within striking distance of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and American Museum of Natural History (quick bus ride to the other side of Central Park), but they\\'re huge and I can\\'t really advise a rush through. They each deserve their own day for anyone non-local who\\'s interested enough to go in the first place. The https://www.frick.org/ is undergoing renovations so they are temporarily using the former Whitney / Met Breuer building on Madison 1. She needs to stand in the official taxi stand line in order to get a taxi from JFK. If I were her, I wouldn\\'t tell the taxi driver how to get to the destination. There\\'s really no way to tell how long it will take to get to her destination, but she\\'ll be traveling at peak times. In order to get back to JFK, I\\'ve always hailed a yellow taxi on the street and have never had an issue.\\n2. Since it\\'s such a short trip, I assume she won\\'t have to deal with the ticketing/baggage desk for her airline and will be able to immediately go to security with her carry ons. Personally, I\\'d be arriving at JFK at least 2 hours before departure.\\n3. Is she sure that she\\'ll be out of her meeting by 10:30 am or could it run late? I wouldn\\'t book timed tickets for anything and would just play it by ear. Maybe she and her friend could do a double decker bus tour...\\nhttps://www.citysightseeingnewyork.com/nyc-bus-tours.html\\nor maybe a sightseeing cruise....\\nhttps://www.circleline.com/ If she gets a cab on the actual taxi line (there\\'s a dispatcher there), there\\'s no \"rogue driver\" problem. Going back, she will be able to see yellow taxis on the street, the lights on top have their cab numbers, and the license plates match medallion numbers. https://www.thrillist.com/news/new-york/here-s-how-to-spot-a-fake-nyc-yellow-cab-that-wants-to-scam-you\\nIt is hard enough to plan trips for people coming themselves. Doubly hard to figure out what your wife and her friend will want to do (and maybe it\\'s just me, but it feels creepy, in a Stepford Wife kind of way). Is there any reason your wife and/or her friend aren\\'t posting? Perhaps they have a specific set of interests? It would be helpful if we knew what is a must-see for her.\\nThe worst traffic can often be IN Manhattan. Since she\\'s going back to JFK, I would consider keeping all of her activities on the East Side, unless it is absolutely imperative to her that she see something like \"Times Square.\"\\nBut then keep in mind that it will add a half hour of time to her taxi commute back to JFK (from the East Side, I would leave an hour, but if she is west of Fifth, I would add a half hour of travel time).\\nShe\\'s going to want to eat in her 4-5 hours too, which itself can be part of the NYC experience, or can be grab and go. All of this is something it would help to know what she\\'s most interested in.\\nIf it were me, I would probably be happy to wander around the Upper East Side with a visit to one of the museums (there are many), a brief entry into Central, (maybe the Conservatory Garden? https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations/conservatory-garden), and a nice lunch to treat herself and her friend at some place lovely. Maybe the restaurant at the Mark Hotel. That would work for me. But I am not your wife or her friend - what do THEY want to do? Hello. Has anyone been to the HP store? Planning a trip this weekend and wanted to check how crowded it gets? Thank you! https://youtu.be/AVWaBtfqjQw\\n^\\nNot my vid.\\nEdited: 1:14 pm, June 10, 2021 Have you checked out reviews over on google? The virtual queue has been selling out by 10am. You can scan for a slot at 7am and then get a return time . You then have 15 minutes to make your slot or you give it away. So, you can\\'t just roll up mid-day, wait in line and get in. We’re going mid October so I’ve been researching and staying up to date on info. I got a notice a few days ago that they’re extending the return time to an hour and that an employee will give you an estimated time to return.\\nBut they stress to get there early to scan the code\\nJoin the HP store Facebook group-they give frequent updates. I will be there in September and am sooo excited! I was hoping to go multiple times during my week there just for the butterbeer! So I guess the trick is to get there around 7 am to scan. In trying to plan accordingly, I\\'m wondering if there might be a link or if you all may know an approximate window of rush hour times for both am and pm subway travelers to and from work? We hope to avoid rush hours as much as possible, but I was hoping there might be a general consensus among you all who are in the know.\\nWe are staying at Courtyard Marriot SoHo on Varick near Houston, so that will be our jumping off point each day.\\nThank you very much for your help! Looking forward to our 3rd trip to your great city! 7AM to 10AM and 3Pm to 7PM should cover the bulk of it In my experience the evening rush hour for subways doesn\\'t start until around 4 or 4:30pm. Rush hours on the subways currently are nowhere near what they were like pre-pandemic. I also sometimes find trains more crowded in the middle of the day than I do during rush hour right now (not before), because the trains are less frequent in the off times and the crowds build up more at each station with the longer wait. There are actually subdivisions of the rush hours. Around 5 or 6 am there are many construction workers. Other occupations are after this. In the afternoon, students form their own rush. Around midnight, there is another rush of building cleaners and hospital workers. I\\'d say Friday PM rush hour starts around 3, Mon-Thurs more like 4.\\nEdited: 12:44 am, June 11, 2021 Just for fun…\\nIf budget was not an option, and you could only dine at one NYC restaurant, which one would you choose and why?\\n:o) Nobody can answer this question for you, everyone has different food tastes But if it was me, id Pick island Oyster on Governors Island, Not going to comment on the food, but the view is to die for I disagree. I think that this is an interesting question. My problem is that I do have to worry about budget and enough of a foodie to be following the latest and greatest. But I would love to know what other people think. I agree this is a fun question - but also a hard one to answer! I think it might be even harder for people who live here. I have dream restaurants in other cities (a couple of which I’ve actually been to), but not here. Even our celebratory places are fairly modest. For whatever reason, a lot of the splurge places in NYC just don’t appeal to me (I’m looking at you, River Cafe! and at you, Per Se).\\nBut the Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare has always intrigued me, so maybe there? Or Cosme. I guess those would be my two money-is-no-object spots.\\nHonestly, though, if I had to pick just one restaurant to eat at for the next year, it would probably be the Afro-French place down the street because the chef-owner is always changing up the menu and trying new things - smoked apricots, wow! - so I wouldn’t get bored. So add Le Succulent to the list. Its a fairly straightforward question. What restaurant would YOU pick and WHY. OP is not asking for recommendations so you don\\'t need to know anything about the OP\\'s tastes.\\nSo Howard you gave an answer and why. Simple.\\nAnd Linda has another take on the question. Instead of interpreting the question as to which restaurant would you pick if it was a once and done choice, where would you go if this choice was the only place you could dine at? Very different choices depending upon your perspective.\\nEdited: 7:38 am, June 09, 2021 After a little thinking and since this is a hypothetical question, I will go with an option that no longer exists. Lutece.\\nI first went ages ago when I started making decent money. It was the most spectacular restaurant I had ever been in. The garden room was like a fantasy. Food was divine. I had never encountered service like this before. The menu changed regularly. Andre Soltner was a celebrity chef before that was a term and foodies were a thing. I only went a few times, but then read about a couple that ate there weekly. They had the same table and never looked at a menu. Soltner would prepare something special for them every week. That would be the life. Having one of the top chefs in the world making dinner just for you every week. So its the choice that could fit either version of the question. Very sad day for dining in NYC when it closed. SloppyEats I enjoyed Lutece back in its day, but only once - cost was prohibitive. Thanks for the memories.\\nAlong similar lines, a new chef Jean George Vongeritchen who was yet to make his name, at Lafayette restaurant, which no longer exists at the Drake Hotel, was something I would repeat if I could do it again. Everything about it was wonderful, partly because it was a new type of (high end) experience for my boyfriend and me, but also because we weren\\'t expecting anything in particular so it was all exciting.\\nThese days I don\\'t particularly fantasize about any particular place. Thanks, Sloppy Eats! I was re-reading my post, and realize I didn’t really give “whys” for Chef’s Table and Cosme, so here goes:\\nCosme because I think Mexican is one of the world’s great cuisines, with an incredible variety of ingredients, flavors and techniques…yet in the U.S. it’s generally treated as cheap and humble (which I love, too, don’t get me wrong). So if money were no object, I’d be very interested in experiencing what Cosme is doing. (Though TBH, it might make more sense to fly to Mexico City and eat at Pujol.)\\nChef’s Table because I’ve always been intrigued by its origin story and the chef’s approach and, rightly or wrongly, it always struck me as more personal, less about trends and conspicuous consumption than places like Per Se. Not sure that’s still the case (if it ever was), and I’m saddened that it’s no longer in Brooklyn. Maybe my dream restaurant is the Chef’s Table of ten years ago. (There might be a lesson there about being adventurous and supporting places when they’re new.)\\nEdited to add - Cross-posted with SE’s Lutece memories and Linda5jink’s contribution, both of which I very much enjoyed reading.\\nEdited: 8:06 am, June 09, 2021 I like this question.\\nFor me, I would say, on a purely superficial level, Leopard at Des Artistes because I heard that Al Pacino likes to go there.\\nFor a more basic reason, a restaurant I would like is the Rainbow Room because it\\'s iconic, at least in my head.\\nIf I look at just expensive, I would go for either Daniel or Milos because I love seafood. I\\'ve been to Milos in Montreal and it was really great and I\\'ve always wondered why it would be like to go to Daniel and sample the food that just looks delicious in pictures. https://nypost.com/2021/06/10/macys-annual-july-4-fireworks-display-will-be-back-in-nyc-de-blasio-says/\\nAnother sign that NYC is getting back to \"normal\"! Interesting. East River. Not sure our new hotel has views. I\\'m not sure where to post this but I think HOP2 is based in New York City so maybe someone will know how to help. We leave for Nairobi in 9 days. Yesterday, we found out that United cancelled our flights. We\\'ve called HOP2 (where we purchased the tickets) and we\\'ve been on hold for 5 hours (four yesterday then one today so far). We get put in a never-ending loop waiting for the \"exchange department\". I can\\'t get a refund or a schedule change. We\\'ve tried the \"chat\" feature and those people say we have to call the \"exchange department\". I can\\'t rebook because I need the $12K first. We stand to lose $30K on our tour if we can\\'t make it. I know this is a first world problem but if anyone knows what else to do, please let me know. There is a thread in the air travel forum about them, I believe. You won\\'t find their NY office, if they really have one, and be able to walk in or anything.\\nThey are not considered to be a good ticket seller. And they don\\'t provide any customer service, the same as all the cheap ticket sellers.\\nYou can try to plead with United to change your booking, but I am afraid you are at the mercy of Hop2.\\nDo you have travel insurance? Never heard of them\\nThey are some sort of middleman booking service?\\nI\\'d repost on the Air Travel forum https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i10702-Air_Travel.html\\nAlso see if your credit card company can void the charges 1. Read the terms and conditions that you agreed to when you booked utilizing a 3rd party platform.\\n2. Contact your credit card/bank and initiate a chargeback due to the cancelled flight.\\n3. Learn to books flights direct. Why? You get better customer service. You del direct with the airline. The airline may be able to make adjustments in cases like this.\\nYou do realize that HOP2 has to request the refund from the airline, the airline has to refund HOP2(their customer) and HOP2 has to refund you...right? That could take MONTHS.\\nABSOLUTELY no reason to use a shoddy 3rd party platform to book anything! Yes, we have travel insurance but I\\'m not sure it covers bad business practices. I didn\\'t know there was an airline forum. I\\'ll try that. We booked in October so credit card won\\'t help. Their disputes go back only 60 days. But I appreciate the advice. It\\'s not bad business practices. You choose to use them. The airline cancelled yesterday. You don\\'t really expect a refund today....do you? You don\\'t think having zero customer service is a bad business practice? You think having your customers wait for 5 hours on hold is a good practice? I really hope you don\\'t have own a business. I do and I wouldn\\'t treat my customers like that.\\nRegarding a refund, I do expect it. They are a multi-million dollar company. They can front the refund and recover it when United submits it. How else are people supposed to rebook?\\nIn any event, if you can\\'t add anything then why are you wasting your time and mine? I never understand people like that. Did you do any due diligence before booking with them?\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/hop2-travel-long-island-city **They can front the refund and recover it when United submits it. How else are people supposed to rebook?**\\nThat\\'s not how it works......and it seems that you didn\\'t do any research prior to using them.\\nYou contracted them to basically enter your details into the airline\\'s portal. You are contracting them to recover the money from the airline. They are not going to front you the money and then wait for the airline to return it. They will refund you, minus fees, when they receive the refund.\\nDo research prior...not after. Credit card assistance is from the date service is to be given, not from the date of purchase of a future service. If it was just from date of purchase it would be pretty useless\\nAnd your travel insurance may very well cover canceled flights that affect your trip\\nOr you can just handwave away the idea of claiming with them and/or your credit card.\\nEdited: 9:55 am, June 09, 2021 What is the situation in NY re C19. I have not booked for this year (or last) usually come for 9 or 10 days end of August. Are people travelling normally ? Situation in UK seems to change every day. USA is pretty wide open and getting wider, but not for International Visitors from most locations yet. We\\'re making progress https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home\\nIt is unclear when the US will permit non-essential travelers from the UK and what requirements there may be if they do https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html\\nIF you make any plans make sure they are fully refundable *upon your request* not at the option of the vendor Wouldn\\'t count on travel anytime in the near future to the US. They are very concerned about the delta variant that is causing UK numbers to go up. I don\\'t think we\\'ve had the flip flopping that the UK has experienced. Instead, it\\'s been a rather steady drum beat of wear the mask, socially distance, and work from home. As in the UK the big issue is around schools and whether or not your child can attend in person classes. The city in the last 2-3 weeks has really seemed to have made great strides toward opening up. That said my office which is downtown is not fully open at this time. I don\\'t think it will open until late August early September. Broadway seems to have pegged September 15 as the grand re-opening and that sound like a good reference point to me. So, if it were me, I would plan on coming to NYC the last two weeks of September.\\nNow can you tell me when you would advice travel to the UK????\\nPam There is no travel corridor set up yet. USA is not on the Green list from the UK, and you are advised against travel. This means that most travel insurance could be null and void. Kaye is right that non essential travel isn\\'t allowed.\\nIt\\'s all in the news today because Joe is here in the UK for the G7 Summit.\\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57390246\\nThe UK Gov website clearly explains what you can do, which is by far a more reliable source than a forum with the majority of regular contributors in NYC, and probably not aware of all the restrictions still in place on travel here from the UK. I can\\'t even go to head office in Copenhagen, even though I\\'m fully vaccinated and Denmark will let me in!\\nPam - I\\'d advise travel to the UK when the respective governments open up the travel to respective countries, and you feel safe to travel.\\nAs much as I want to get away somewhere for a few days, I\\'m just waiting patiently for things to unlock, and I\\'m enjoying London as my playground.\\nM We are traveling to NYC by car this week. We are coming direct from DC and I want to confirm that each member of the family needs to complete the NY Health Form the day prior to arrival. Is this correct or is one per family acceptable?\\nThanks in advance. https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory\\nDon\\'t know if you can do a group form Every adult has to do their own form. You can include children and dependents on one of the adults\\' forms. They have a place to add that info on the form for as m1any kids as you want (step 4). The wife and I will be at the Chelsea Market on a Wednesday evening around 4:30-5:30. Around 5:15-5:30, we need to heard towards Pier 83 for a sunset cruise w/ Circle Line. I see on google maps we could do one of the following, and I just need to know please which would be the safest route depending on that area of streets on the west side. Thank you very much.\\nOption 1 - Walk the Hudson River Greenway all the way up to Pier 83 (my first choice due to view, etc., but we will have done a ton of walking already that day w/ 2 other tours).\\nOption 2 - Walk over to 12th ave and all the way north to Pier 83.\\nOption 3 - Walk over to 10th ave & 16th St and take the M11 to 10th Ave & 42nd, then walk to Pier 83\\nAfterwards, around 9:00-9:30, I\\'m assuming the safest way back would be the M42 to 42nd Ave/7th St station to get back to our hotel on Varick using the 1 downtown?\\nAny suggestions from those who know these neighborhoods the best? Thank you in advance for your help! You can take the m12 bus up 11th Ave.\\nIf you’re going to walk, I would walk up the Greenway. Those avenues are kind of deserted otherwise and not especially interesting to walk.\\nEdited: 6:02 pm, June 09, 2021 If you haven\\'t already bought the Circle Line tickets,\\nSail-nyc.com\\nhas sunset cruises either on a yacht or a schooner that leave from Chelsea Piers, very close to Chelsea Market. They\\'re nicer boats but more expensive.\\nIf you want to stick to your plan, a bus or taxi is imo better, especially if you will have already done a lot of walking. It,s a 30 min. Walk. I would walk HIgh Line and take taxi/uber on the way back Thank you all. Believe we are going to plan to walk the high line (depending on how tired we are 😄), and taxi back afterwards. Appreciate the help.\\nEdited: 8:04 am, June 10, 2021 Are there lots of taxis around Pier 83? I\\'m doing the same thing in August and want to take a taxi afterwards as well. It,s been years since I did this, but at that time, there were very few cabs around. You might have to walk a few blocks east or take the crosstown bus on 42 st. Hi. I’m traveling at the end of June with my daughter (11 years old) who will be visiting for the first time. I’m concerned about the amount of people in the subways. She doesn’t have the covid vaccine yet since she’s under 12. How crowded are the subways nowadays? What precautions are taken due to covid? Is it mandatory to wear masks? Subways are crowded to the extent that you may not be able to socially distance at times but not to the point where every car is completely full of people the way it was before pandemic. Masks are required for everyone pn the subway and people on the trains comply with that about 99% of the time in my experience. I avoided the subway until I was vaccinated. I\\'ve been slowly returning. I took the subway today. If I wasn\\'t vaccinated, I would have gotten off at the next stop. Way too crowded for my personal tolerance level if unvaccinated - practically every seat taken and many people standing. That was at 4PM. Note the use of \"my personal tolerance level\". I don\\'t know what yours is, but if it was my kid, I wouldn\\'t take the subway at this level. Please note that many people will have many opinions on this topic. Only you can decide what\\'s right for you and your family. I take the subway to work almost every day. Been doing that since summer of 2020 with a few breaks. Compared to last year, the trains are quite full. Early morning say around 6-7 am, trains are not to bad. But if you are taking trains during the afternoon rush, the trains are almost as full as pre-pandemonium. Yesterday afternoon, the trains on the Lex line were packed. Maybe the rain made more people take the subway. I\\'ve noticed a dramatic upswing in riders since Memorial Day. Everyone is wearing masks. I generally take the subway outside of peak hours/directions (e.g., while commuters are heading into Manhattan, I’m going farther south in Brooklyn). I’m definitely more comfortable now that I’m vaccinated, but I wasn’t really UNcomfortable before (have been back using transit for close to a year), and have not noticed a huge uptick in passengers recently. You often can’t social distance in the sense of being 6 ft apart, but I’ve never felt stuck next to someone breathing in my face for an extended period - which would freak me out even now.\\nMask usage is almost universal. If anything, I’d say it’s gotten better as requirements elsewhere have eased. That could be my imagination, or it could be that wearing a mask in more limited circumstances, like transit, is easier for people.\\nAs others have noted, no one else can really speak to your specific circumstances,so I’m just sharing my own report from the ground (or underground). I ride the subway daily. Have been doing that for months. I also agree that 99% of people wear masks.It is crowded compared to last year.\\nI would be fine taking the subway if I had a 12 year old. Should you? That is a decision that you will need to make. I am not 100% sure on this, but when NY hits 70% vaccination rate (Likely within next week) Cumo has said he is going end most restrictions, I do not know if this will including mandatory masks on the Subway\\nI personally have not been on the Subway since Feb 2020 Any mask guidelines from the state at this point are advisory & businesses are making their own decisions as to whether to ask for masks or not. I\\'ve been in a big relatively crowded store where masks are optional & smaller much less crowded one where they still have mask please signs still up. I was never a germaphobe. I have 2-3 friends who had behaviors I thought were kind of silly, at one point. They won\\'t sit on the subway because of germs, won\\'t touch the pole to hold on, and then they do this balancing dance to not fall down. All kinds of funny behaviors. Another friend who always brought alcohol wipes for the plane and her hotel room before she would touch anything. I thought they were nuts. Now we\\'re all using alcohol wipes on planes (or maybe not \"all\", but they\\'re handing them out on planes and many are using them.) If nothing else, far less incidence of colds/flu this year - a great thing. I plan to continue using a mask on the subway and continue to use sanitizer after I get off before touching anything else. I\\'m not an epidemiologist or a physician, who knows what works or doesn\\'t? Not me, it\\'s all about personal choices. It seems that after all of the craziness (including mine), Covid wasn\\'t spread on the subway, but I still didn\\'t ride it (I walked a LOT, not a bad habit to have cultivated.) Regardless of what the official rules are, if you choose to ride the subway, if it were my daughter, she would stay masked. But you\\'re the parent, not me.\\nLast night, I met a friend for drinks and she ordered spiced peanuts to share...I sanitized before dipping into the shared bowl. She didn\\'t after coming in from the subway (at least not in front of me). So I didn\\'t eat the peanuts. Yup, I became one of the nutjobs now. We\\'ll see how long it lasts. You can monitor the NYS covid situation here https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home\\nHere\\'s how things may change IF we reach 70% https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-most-remaining-covid-19-restrictions-be-lifted-when-70-adult-new Thanks everyone for your answers! Of course, my daughter will wear a mask EVERYWHERE since she\\'s not vaccinated. I think she will wear double-mask for the plane and subways. I will still wear a mask even though I\\'m fully vaccinated. The DELTA variant is easily transmitted from what I read, so I need to take precautions, mainly for my daughter. It’s me again! I know there is a WEALTH of restaurants to choose from, but I don’t wanna waste money on crappy experiences. We will stay in Midtown south, and visiting the typical “tourist” areas. Please give me top suggestions for a family with kiddos. I’m not interested in fancy spots- dinner we will splurge a bit more obviously than lunch and breakfast. We love pubs, outdoor seating laid atmospheres. I have plenty of pizza suggestions but looking beyond that! I should add- I did ask a couple months ago for some suggestions and got tons of feedback about Pizza spots I’d asked for (which I am thankful for). I am casting out a line to anyone else with great suggestions as I am making a list for us to go back to and check out You have to be more specific. What is \"midtown south\"? What are the typical \"tourist areas\"?\\nMillions of people visit NYC every year and what you consider \"typical\\' is not what many do. Please be more specific.\\n\"Midtown south\"? Honestly, no one really calls an area in the city that. Where are you staying/hotel? Most NYC restaurants do not have a \"kids menu\". Sure, if you ask, they\\'ll make you a plain pasta with butter or something like that. But I can\\'t remember the last time I saw a kids\\' menu. Earlier today, I heard a kid asking his dad for a cappuccino while the dad was pointing out a \"noodle shop.\"\\nYou must be much more specific about what you\\'re looking for beyond \"not pizza\" and what your budget is. Are your kids fussy eaters?\\nThere\\'s an Irish pub every few blocks all over the city...I have never personally found that any one of them is better than any other. Look for a green sign and you\\'re good to go. Or maybe consider PJ Clarke\\'s or something like that. ^\\n+1\\nThere are at least 2 burger spots near to Rock Ctr. Bill\\'s Bar and another that I can\\'t remember. Is that what you are looking for?\\nOutdoor seating? When are you coming? Time Out Market. Smorgasburg.\\nAnother option is Essex Market.\\nAgain, pls be more specifis as to where you are staying and where you will be. Well I know what Midtown South is and the NYPD has a Midtown South pct, so the name is used sometimes but it is a macro area. and contained within the area is a number of neighborhoods and usually those neighborhoods are what people refer to (like they will say Koreatown or Times Square etc) Some people just refer to the whole thing has midtown. Its such a large area though it is difficult to make recommendations without more specifics. Depending on who is defining the area it could be like 30 blocks from one part of midtown south to another. Try naming the specific neighborhood you are staying in or if you don\\'t know just give the cross streets and people will know where you mean. Also, other than pizza it would help if you mention some other types of foods you enjoy or might like to try. **Well I know what Midtown South is**\\nI \"sorta\" do also......but for someone visiting, it could be anywhere from 17th St to 40th St...give or take. Well that’s how our hotel referred to their location as and pardon me for not knowing since I’m a first timer. We will be 2 blocks from ESB if that helps.\\nWe aren’t too picky- a good burger, BBQ, sandwiches, Chinese, etc we will try lots. Kids will too.\\nWe will be south near battery park, visiting Brooklyn Bridge area, all over Central Park, Greenwich Village, TS.... And we are coming next week. We love a good patio The furthest south I have heard of midtown south going is 23rd street. Others tend to put the border around 29th street which is closer to the way I feel about it. Have heard the northern border being 42nd or as high as 45th. Depends on who you ask.\\n2 blocks from the ESB well that would be within walking distance of Koreatown so you could get some korean BBQ. Also to the east in walking distance is Curry Hill if you like Indian food. Over on Lexington between 27th and 28th street. To the east of you would be the neighborhood of Murray Hill with a wide variety of restaurants as well. If you want cheap Takeout Chinese is almost as common as Pizza, Almost on every corner Is the garment district a safe place for three females to stay during a first time trip to NYC?\\nIt would be myself and my two daughters age 16 and 21. Do you have specific hotel (s) in mind? Can you be more specific about where within the Garment District? https://goo.gl/maps/A2ufw7B16Ykt54kb6\\nThe parts towards the west, especially near the bus station, are probably not suitable at this time.\\nTo get additional hotel advice/suggestions specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station (OR if driving and need parking - directions of travel) and 4) hotel budget.\\nEdited: 12:17 pm, June 09, 2021 Currently have reservations at the Archer Hotel The more troubled section of the neighborhood is on the other side and north a bit, but where the Archer Hotel is fine. Lots of food choices to the east and south. Currently have reservations at the Archer Hotel\\nWe will be staying over Christmas.\\nIf you have suggestion of best airport to use that would be helpful as well.\\nIf a different area would be safer I am willing to change hotels. We will be in town for 7 days and would like to visit many of the main attractions (Rockefeller, Broadway, Empire State Building, Dryker Heights, Radio City Music Hall, Statute of Liberty, Central Park etc) There is no reason to change the location based on safety issues. You are well positioned to see many of the attractions on your list as well as many of the store displays etc. Best airport is the airport with the best flight times and prices for you. There isn\\'t a substantial difference between the airports in terms of your destination. **Best airport is the airport with the best flight times and prices for you.**\\nAgree. Pick based on your schedule and pricing. The Archer is a lovely hotel in a good location near Bryant Park but their rooms are small and a room for 3 will have 2 double beds. There are hotels with 2 queen beds. But if you\\'re all small or getting 2 rooms, it\\'s a nice place at Xmas time. There,s an ice rink at Bryant Park and a Xmas market. It does tend to make the area busy though.\\nIf you want to look at a hotel with bigger rooms or 2 queen beds, post back with a budget. Room budget around $3,000 for 7 nights\\nWe originally picked the Archer because of room amenities, good reviews, especially those noting how clean the hotel is and how accommodating and helpful staff is, we are going into the trip completely blind as to the in and outs of NYC and the view of the Empire State Building\\nThe small size is a concern though I am highly organized person so I was thinking it could work. Basically I was giving size in trade for friendly staff (or from what I have read)\\nBut I am open to looking at other places as well especially if they offer Christmas decorations to the room. I am not familiar with that hotel but would not consider W38 between 5th and 6th a particularly dangerous area (I also consider it part of the trimmings district, which is sort of a subdistrict of garment district and not a bad place to be if you are in the market for things like buttons and ribbons; I like M & J on 6th Av). I think most recent problems have been further west than that. Sounds like it may be just down the block from the recently closed flagship Lord & Taylor department store. May not be most convenient place for subway access, but there are plenty of buses headed downtown on 5th and uptown on 6th and Madison. Also, shouldn\\'t be difficult getting taxis around there. https://nypost.com/2021/06/09/france-sending-us-a-second-statue-of-liberty/\\n\"The little lady will reportedly be shipped out of France next week and reach New York Harbor on July 1. After the 4th of July holiday, the statue will be housed at the French ambassador’s residence in Washington, the article said.\" We are traveling to NYC and I’m just trying to narrow down itinerary! I just need some opinions. We have 4 kids ages 3, 11, 12 and 13 coming with us.\\n1. One World Observatory or Empire State?\\n2. Should we bother with the Met? I saw they require masks for ages 2 and over and not sure my 3 year old will comply with hers during an entire museum trip.\\n3. A trip to Coney Island? Or something else?\\nI already have our tickets to SOL/EI and we plan to do Central Park and TS, Brooklyn Bridge, 5th Ave, Chinatown, Little Italy etc... just wanting opinions on what’s worth it for other timed entry tickets and at least half a say at CI. 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️ 1. NEITHER....Go to Top of the Rock, you will get photos of the ESB\\n2. NY is going to ditch the masks when vaccination rate hot 70% which should be in about a week\\n3. Coney Island is good in the Summer, especially with kids, Be aware its about a 45 Min Subway Ride from Manhattan Central Park is very large. Recommend having a plan to maximize your time there. Be aware that if you are flying, your three year old will need to be masked for the flights. I thought about Top of The Rock too- I’ll look into it again. I’m hoping the mask mandate will ease up especially for my little one!\\nWe are prepared for Coney Island ride there- no biggie. And got some stuff mapped out for Central Park.\\nAnd I know she’ll have to wear one on the plane- she had to once and did very well. It’s a different story when she’s walking and running around and “busy,” though. If there,s a second adult on the trip, I recommend thinking about splitting up sometimes. The 3 year old will likely not have the stamina and attention span that the other kids will. It would be easy for one adult to spend time in Central Park with the little one while the other 3 kids and adult go into the Met Museum which backs onto the park. Another option...most kids like the Museum of Natural History with dinosaurs and from the movie “Night At the Museum.” If they haven\\'t seen it, would be fun to watch before the trip. The Muppets Take Manhattan is another good kids movie to get them in the mood.\\nPS Museum of Natural History also very close to the park.\\nEdited: 10:46 am, June 08, 2021 Please note, even if the state recommends removing masks whether or not you & your kids are asked to wear a mask is up to the individual venue. I go to a large grocery store & masks are optional whereas the pet food store in the same open air shopping complex was still requiring masks which was intereting for me as the grocers typically have many many more people in it that the pet food place. 1. I would go to the ESB at night and One World in the daytime, so check when you think you\\'d be going based on your itinerary.\\n2. Yes to the Met.\\n3. Coney Island would be good. The beach is right there too for a run on the sand and a dip in the water if it\\'s hot. You never mentioned when you are coming...unless I missed it. Coney Island depends on the amount of time you\\'re here and if your kids want to sit on a subway to get there.\\nWhat about Governors Island instead?\\nIf the choice was between OWO and ESB, I would pick ESB as the first choice. ESB is iconic and an outdoor observatory. I have yet to get to OWO, but haven\\'t been too excited because it\\'s indoors. TOTR is another option as well. In my opinion, if one observatory was in order, either ESB or TOTR. And not one shag carpet in sight. Looks very sleek.\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos/new-halls-gems-and-minerals-american-museum-natural-history?image=0 Well, I suppose museum displays change according to fashion like other things. The new mineral gallery display cases seem cluttered as do those at the new English Decorative Arts, newer parts of the Egyptian and Musical Instrument collection at the Met. The old mineral hall had a mysterious quality to it that invited exploration. I will have to visit prior to passing final judgment on the gallery. Some of the comments in the Gothamist are rather scathing. The large gaping geodes bear witness to vulgarity in nature. Now, if they would only bring back the wonderful shell collection that was a delightful display. Looks very sleek and polished to me. Very modern.\\nPlease report back when you go. Family of 7 (4 adults, 3 kids).\\nWe are visiting to celebrate my moms birthday. Our last three trips we have opted to stay in Jersey City because of room size and cost. Because we are celebrating my moms birthday I wanted to stay in Times Square (this is the area she would normally stay and loves it).\\nWe currently have rooms booked at the the following hotels (have never stayed at any of them):\\nThe Manhattan at Times Square\\n- 2 junior suites with terrace\\nPros\\n- larger rooms with a terrace (never stayed at a hotel with terrace)\\nCons/concerns\\n- reviews stating rooms are dated\\nKimpton Muse Times Square\\n- 2 Queen Rooms (2 Queen beds in each room)\\nPros\\n- modern hotel\\n- Each room as 2 Queen beds\\nConcerns\\n- rooms smaller than rooms at The Manhattan or Radio City Apts\\nRadio City Apartments\\n- 2 one bedroom apartments\\nPros\\n- larger room with separate bedroom\\n- Kitchen\\nCons\\n- rooms look very dated\\nWhat hotel will provide the best overall stay? I want it to be something nice since it is for my moms birthday but I also want it to be practical for the number of us traveling.\\nKimpton is the cheapest with the rooms at the Manhattan and Radio City being only a few hundred dollars more. Sheraton kicked The Manhattan out of their family a number of years ago as it wasn\\'t up to their standards.\\nStarwood, (now Bonvoy) kicked The Manhattan out of their family a few years later as it hadn\\'t gotten any better.\\nUnless you can find something on the internet saying it has been refurbished, I would avoid this property.\\nI am curious what the reviews you have read about it have said, if the numbers have improved lately Reviews are hit and miss for sure. Was not aware that it had been banished by other hotel chains.\\nWe reserved because of the price and the fact that it was a junior suite with a terrace.\\nI appreciate the feedback. These questions are so hard to answer for other people. I was in one of the Kimpton rooms a few years ago when a friend stayed there. I liked it. That would be my preference, newer, modern, kind of chic. But that’s my taste. I would 100% sacrifice a bit of space for style in a boutique type property (if that’s the neighborhood you want to be in). Interesting about the other property being kicked out hotel groups.\\nWhether you and your family have the same metrics for hotel preferences as I do (or anyone on this board) is doubtful. Maybe have a family conference about it?\\nI have a friend who is a smoker - she always books a terrace for that reason. I could not care less about a terrace, especially in manhattan where you are going to be out all day anyhow.\\nEdited: 3:11 pm, June 09, 2021 The Kimpton Muse is so much nicer than the other 2, it\\'s not even debatable. The other 2 hotels are budget options and Haven,t been updated in years. They will also provide little to no service. The Muse is a 4 star hotel. If you think you need a kitchen for your mother, that,s another story. Check out the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square on 8th Ave at 48th to 49th Sts., where I\\'ve stayed several times. It has modern, good-sized rooms, and is close to the Times Square action. There are other HGIs in Times Square, HGI Times Square Central on 42nd St. and HGI Times Square South on 37th St., but their rooms may be smaller I\\'ve been in one of those Terrace rooms. They are on the 2nd floor, behind the building\\'s marquee facing 7th Avenue. There is zero view except for up. The terrace was not clean. It was our last time staying at that property for that and other reasons. We had stayed there probably a dozen times and watched it slip downhill.\\nEdited: 4:17 pm, June 09, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

Seems a no brainer to fly otherwise its wasting a lot of time in transit. As mentioned above you don\\'t need to take a car from the airport. How long is an Amtrak trip from Arkansas going to take??\\nEdit: I had to look it up. 42 hours!\\nEdited: 8:08 pm, June 08, 2021 Ande, if you\\'re coming from Boston or Washington DC, I can understand your question. But if you,re coming from Little Rock, just fly. Your time and sanity matter as much as cost. There are 3 nyc area airports and price of a taxi into Manhattan is ~ $40-$100 depending on which airport you use. There are also public transport options that can cost as little as $8/person.\\nBtw, there are 3 Chinatowns in NYC, in Manhattan, in Brooklyn and in Queens. The only reasons take a train from Arkanasas instead of flying is either you are afraid to fly or you want to take a train trip to see the country Depends what airport you are flying into. Cabs and Ubers usually range around $40-$60 from LaGuardia to Midtown West or Upper West Side. Should be close to that for Manhattan Chinatown. Depends on time of arrival too. This is probably the first thread on this forum that I have ever seen where a poster made a reference to \"Chinatown,\" and the responders did not seem to assume that the lower Manhattan neighborhood was the \"Chinatown\" intended. I kmow that there are other neighborhoods in New York City where Chinese culture and people are concentrated, such as in Queens and Brooklyn, but are these areas also generally called \"Chinatown\"? Chinatown in NYC means the Chinatown in Manhttan\\nThe Asian part of Queens is called Flushing (Although about 1/3 of Queens is asian)\\nThe asian part of Brooklyn is Sunset Park On a previous visit a few years back I remember seeing a food courtish type area in Grand Central as we were walking around. Is that still there and if so given covid and all what types of places are there and are there any breakfast type places where a small bite could be gotten in the mid morning time frame during the week. Still there. I don’t know what’s open now - a few months ago it was pretty depleted. You can follow updates on the website. https://www.grandcentralterminal.com/dining-concourse/ I pass through GC weekly and go downstairs often(last time was this past Saturday.)\\nThere are only a few stalls open. If you bother to head down, use the stairs adjacent to the Apple store. Then make a u-turn. You will see the open stalls.\\nNot really worth a visit at the moment. IF/when the GCTShake shack reopens, their breakfast sandwiches are great. \"GCTShake shack reopens, their breakfast sandwiches are great.\"\\nYou only need to go there for burgers. I sure hope it’s back to normal by my next trip. I always eat lunch there at least once each trip, one of my favorite people watching spots in the city. It exists but most places have been closed most of the pandemic. Food stands will prob open as more tourists return over the summer Yes as mentioned there are a number of stalls open. The issue is all of the of the sitting areas and benches (at least a week ago) were closed off. That may have changed now, but just be prepared for not finding anywhere to sit and eat the food you get down there... The food court area was certainly rather desolate the last time I was there a few months ago - sorry to hear that’s still the case.\\nAt the risk of providing TMI - the occasion for my last visit was a medical procedure in the vicinity; a very depleting one that involves a liquid diet and fasting. So I was pretty ravenous afterwards.While the food court (along w my fave Great Northern) was a bust, the coffee shops on the main level were generally open for pastries and breakfast sandwich-type fare. If I’m not mistaken I picked something up from Bien Cuit, which is a very nice bakery. Hello travel experts :) I have a bit of tricky question and would really appreciate some local knowledge!\\nWe will be flying to NYC with 2 kids and a baby in a few weeks, staying in Lower Manhattan, near Battery Park. We will be super jetlagged, so the kids will be up at 3am for the first few days.\\nWhat is there to do this early in the morning? Is it safe to go for a walk before sunrise? At dawn? Planning to walk the Brooklyn Bridge one morning.\\nAny good 24 hour breakfast/food places nearby?\\nAre there any areas in Manhattan that are unsafe and are best to avoid?\\nAnd general NYC safety tips with baby/kids would be much appreciated too! The walkway along Hudson River is nice. Depending on how far you feel like walking, you could end up in Tribeca for example and have breakast there. Several places there.\\nCheck out the following diners to see opening hours. The Covid pandemic might have affected opening hours and made places cut back on those. But these have typically been opening early before the pandemic but may very well open later now.\\nGeorge\\'s diner is on the corner of Greenwich and Rector streets. Quite near some of the hotels near Battery Park.\\nGee Whiz is a bit further, in Tribeca. About a 20 min walk or so from Battery Park. On Greenwich and Warren streets.\\nPearl Diner on Pearl and Fletcher Streets. It always helps to have exact locations. Depending on where your hotel is, George’s is probably the best, but you may find that there is something that suits you closer to your hotel. I don’t understand sending people to Tribeca from FiDi for breakfast, unless it’s on your way to your first stop. There’s a new Le Pain Quotidien on Pearl behind the big building at Broad, and Le Parisienne in Maiden Lane, which is further from BP but closer than Tribeca, and many small places with a few tables but mostly take-out. A lot of places like that have closed during the pandemic, but are gradually reopening. Perhaps a ride on the (free 24/7) Staten Island Ferry for a nice view of the skyline, harbor and SOL https://www.siferry.com/schedules.html Here\\'s a map of the greenway mentioned above http://www.nyc.gov/html/edc/pdf/greenway_mapside.pdf\\nAt some point you may want to visit the new https://littleisland.org/ park.

I didn’t think us Brits could come to the US at the moment.\\nI keep reading here that Biden/Johnson might discuss this during the G7 meetings. Thanks! Walk by the river sounds lovely! Thank you so much, that’s lots of ideas! Hi,\\nWe’ll be in NYC June 10-14. I looked up the weather and it looks like the temps should be between 73-79. Being from California, 73 can be cool. My question is... is it 73 and humid. Should I pack shorts for warm weather or pants for cooler weather.\\nTIA for your help\\nEdited: 2:29 pm, June 08, 2021 Sorry not to really answer your question but it all depends on how you react to heat & humidity. When I would travel with my mom, you\\'d swear that she & I were an different trips as she was always too warm & I am usually too cold. I will tell you that, because NYC is right on the Atlantic Ocean, NYC tends to be more humid & therefore feels warmer just because it\\'s more humid. I would pack both, honestly (or if not shorts, something suitable for sticky weather). NYC does tend to be humid. Plus weather forecasts change…today, for example, is warmer than I’d been expecting. Jeans, shorts, light dress (if female), sweater or denim jacket, something w a hood or an umbrella if it rains (or buy one here), a few t shirt-type tops...prepare for everything.\\nMe? I take an oversized scarf w me everywhere - a/c, temp drops, rain, “pillow” for the plane, it does everything for me. The weather has been crazy here lately. We\\'re having a heat wave which is not really common in June. Had some really strong storms this afternoon as well. It\\'s been humid, but I looked at the forecast and see nice temps for Friday. Weather is too hard to predict. NYC is a humid city especially when it\\'s rainy.\\nWunderground has a Humidity predictor. Currently it says 99% humidity so that\\'s extremely humid. Anything above 75% is very humid to me.\\nhttps://www.wunderground.com/forecast/us/ny/new-york-city Like in California, wear layers in New York in June. I walk around with a backpack and toss my sweater/sweatshirt inside when temps go up and pull it out if/when the temps drop in the evening. It also depends on your heat & humidity tolerance. Last, it’s easy to forget that when it’s warm outside, the a/c inside department stores, museums, restaurants, etc. feels much cooler after you’ve been walking outside. Got caught in the downpour. Was running late so didn’t go back up for an umbrella. Absolute torrential storm today and my white linen pants were soaked from the knee down. Walgreens had two umbrellas left (lucky me) and I got a purple one that matched the logos of NYU where I was meeting my parents at docs office. That is to say, yes. 100% humidity, umbrellas are generally available for purchase. White linen pants have dried (mostly) and I have earned my cocktail.\\nI don’t want to know what my hair looks like, however. **Should I pack shorts for warm weather or pants for cooler weather.**\\nYes. \"Got caught in the downpour. \" Something for tourists to be aware of is that when in places like Manhattan with lots of tall buildings you aren\\'t always able to see what storms may be coming in the distance. The end result is that you can be walking along and it will be sunny and next thing you know all hell is breaking loose and there is a downpour. I get these alerts for flash floods or severe thunderstorms on my phone. Don\\'t ignore those. It may look perfectly fine outside but trust me things can change suddenly and I have been caught out more times than I like. NYC usually has more of a humidity during day in summer unless you are near the water. 73 can be cooler at night, but depends on humidity for the day. Pack a light jacket or sweater and you should be fine I’m planning a trip the latest week in July, but really don’t want to mess it up because of the crowds and weather... it’s my dream to visit this place I do not think the international borders will be open by then, Plan for next summer\\nSummer 2021 NYC will only be open to domestic travellers If you are ok with 90 degrees and humidity you will be fine in NYC in July. Lots of A/C everywhere if you need to take a break. Well the fact that both weather and crowds are both concerns should tell you what the general consensus is on the former.\\nWho knows about crowds this year but NYC is always crowded and if/when that\\'s less of an issue it\\'s because the weather sucks so I don\\'t know if there\\'s a week when neither is a potential issue. Is it really hotter than Colombia? yes, NYC is a lot hotter than Bogata Columbia in the summer months. Bogota isn\\'t very hot because it\\'s so high in elevation. One feature of the hot summer days is sometimes the afternoon thunderstorm, These generally do not last very long, but you would want to take shelter indoors and not be wandering about Central Park. The weather forecasts will warn of these. The temperatures are not unlike coastal areas of Colombia such as Cali. ***If you are ok with 90 degrees and humidity you will be fine in NYC in July. Lots of A/C everywhere if you need to take a break.***\\nWeather is hard to predict and humidity is not something that is always present. Sure, we get our fair amount of humid days, but not every day in July is 90 degrees and humid. Regardless, A/C is everywhere and it is easy to take a break and cool off if needed. Weather is a funny thing. I see people recommending visiting in the winter because it’s cheaper. That is a horror to me - I would rather be too hot than too cold and never travel to a cold city in the winter. So, what’s your poison? If July works for other reasons and you don’t plan on being outside ALL of the time, I would say do it. If you experience health problems or don’t like heat and humidity, no reassurance will relieve that for you. I always recommend our beaches in the Summer Months Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) from NY Penn Station offers a lot of Beach get aways, the Fire Island Beaches are all fun (The Pines is a popular gay beach on Fire Island and featured on many television shows), and I see they are starting concerts at Jones beach again too.\\nIf you want to stay local Coney Island is a classic beach with an amusement park, and Far Rockaway Beach offers surf lessons (where they provide the wet suit) at Averne by The Sea (both of those can be reached by subway).\\nAlso NYC has had a lot of free kayaking along the Hudson river, so give can give that a try too.\\nHappy planning & (most importantly) Have fun! \"yes, NYC is a lot hotter than Bogata Columbia in the summer months.\"\\nThat\\'s surprising! They\\'re caused by the lack of drivers, says Curbed:\\nhttps://www.curbed.com/2021/06/uber-lyft-expensive-new-york-city.html?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Curbed%20-%20June%207%2C%202021&utm_term=Subscription%20List%20-%20Curbed Luckily we have a mass transit system that most people can get around on. I\\'ve seen other reports that indicate the shortage is temporary and by the Fall there will be too many cabs on the road and not enough passengers. Thanks for posting. I don’t take them often here, but there are just some times when nothing other than a car service or taxi would do (such as getting to Laguardia from our neighborhood or bringing home the occasional very large purchase).\\nObi sounds like it\\'s trying to be the kayak.com of car services. Interesting. According to that article, Uber\\'s business model is unsustainable. \"And when it comes to getting around not just New York City but any city, Uber’s business model is, frankly, never going to be sustainable from a financial, environmental, or spatial perspective. “Uber has been losing billions of dollars for years and years,” says Robin Chase, founder of the New Urban Mobility Alliance. “Raising their prices is the only way they’ll ever break even or become profitable.” If that is so, Uber is living on borrowed time. Interesting read. I havent had that issue with Uber rides from LaGuardia to Manhattan being much higher than pre pamdemic when I flew out in early May, but have noticed rides around Manhattan being much higher lately Taking the kids (ages 21, 18, 16) to NYC for a family vacation, first week of July. I know it will be hot, but it\\'s the only week we can all go together. Hubs and I haven\\'t been there in over 30 years, and our kids are first-timers.\\nWould like to hit all the highlights (Statue of Liberty, 911 Memorial, Empire State Building, Central Park, Natural History Museum). I know some people that stay in New Jersey and take a ferry over to the city for sightseeing. Would you recommend this, or staying in the city? If city, can you give me a general location in Manhattan? Any other must-sees (besides what I\\'ve listed above?) For the best experience, stay in Manhattan. There are many options and many different neighborhoods to choose from.\\nYou asked about a specific location, I would start with areas such as Chelsea, the Flatiron District, and Union Square for starters. Many other neighborhoods will work as well, it really depends on your budget, etc. To get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport (or if driving and need parking) and 4) hotel budget.\\nIf you wish to set foot on Liberty & Ellis islands you should purchase tickets from Statue Cruises well in advance To add to what Kaye said, please note that taxes will add 15% to the base cost of your hotel. **Any other must-sees (besides what I\\'ve listed above?)**\\n-Rockefeller Center is a must see, in my opinion, for first time visitors.\\n-Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge in the evening(or first thing in the AM.)\\n-Union Sq or Washington Sq Park in the summer will always be very lively.\\n-Coney Island?\\n-Any sports fans in the family? Photo in front of Madison Sq Garden.\\n-Peruse one of the 3 major Chinatown areas in NYC(Sunset Park, Flushing or Manhattan.)\\n-Check back to see if any summer concerts will be taking place.\\n-Times Sq at night is a must in my opinion.\\n-A walk by Macy\\'s/Plaza Hotel/Wall Street.\\nSo many options in NYC...even during these times.\\nAlso, please ask the 21, 18 and 16 year old to do some research and pick 3-4 attractions/places that they wish to do/see. They may want to go off on their own one afternoon/evening/day. IMHO - the ONLY reason to stay in NJ when visiting NYC is if your budget drives you in that direction - and FWIW - with a family of 5, you\\'d have to save a LOT on hotel+parking to make up for 5 round trips a day (on anything other than the PATH train).\\nFollowing on that - if budget is driving you - then look for a hotel with easy access to the PATH train. If not - stay in NYC.\\nAnd you didn\\'t note how long you are staying - but for anything but he briefest of stays, I wouldn\\'t restrict yourself to Manhattan destinations. Consider the Zoo, Botanical Gardens, the Cloisters, Wave Hill...\\nOr Brooklyn Chinatown... Or see if they\\'re doing Smorgasburg by then, or ...\\nAnd, of course, while in Manhattan - I\\'d add a walk (or better a CityBike ride) along the Hudson, the High Line, walks through the West Village, the East Village, Soho, ... other parks beyond just Central Park >> Washington Square Park can be fun...\\nAnd maybe a rooftop bar for a fun view for all - and a drink for three of you...\\nEdited: 6:37 pm, May 11, 2021 By all means, Stay in Manhattan! You could add Rockefeller Center, The High Line, the Met Museum & Edge (the highest outdoor sky deck in the Western Hemisphere) to your list. ** Any other must-sees (besides what I\\'ve listed above?)**\\nWhat interests do the 21, 18 & 16 year old have? Listing major tourist attractions may help, but they may want to experience checking out some of the major NYC sneaker stores, hanging in the Village, shopping, etc. Thanks for the responses! Looks like Manhattan will be the best option. We are sports fans, so will try to go to a Mets or Yankees game. The 16-year old likes to shop and the 18 & 21 kids like military history. This has given me some good \"starting points\" for planning our trip. It can be a little overwhelming. We stayed in union city, New Jersey (family of 5). This added about an hour each day to and from (tunnel traffic, waiting for “Jinty” buses). Once you add the $30 at least for bus fare back and forth and the hour added, staying in Manhattan will be worth the extra $$$. should I rent a car or take the train from DC to NYC and NYC to boston? Your trip advisor friends are going to want to know all kinds of details about when and where, how many people, what you will be doing in both places, where you will be staying etc. and what to plan to do with the car when there.\\nThe destination experts are volunteer anonymous people, not travel guides. They don’t work in a vacuum without any information. Ah- you wrote rent a car- that makes even less sense to do.\\nEdited: 3:57 am, June 08, 2021 I do those drives a couple of times a year and strongly advise against it. The driving can be stressful going either way and there is nothing scenic on the drive DC to NYC and not enough NYC to Boston to make it worth it.\\nAlso, parking is costly in all 3 cities.\\nEdited: 8:40 am, June 08, 2021 Unless you have plans to make stops at tourist spots in between the cities the train is better.\\nTraffic is very heavy, parking expensive and you do not need a car as those cities all have good public transit systems\\nAmtrak tickets are less expensive when booked in advance. Train train train but plan far in advance when prices are cheaper. Hmmm.... Renting a car vs. Train?\\nTrain is less expensive, faster, less stress, removes parking hassle in three cities.\\nI think someone else said it - but unless you have things you want to do outside of / between the cities - then >> TRAIN. Generally, Amtrak is best, but not the overpriced Acela trains that save you little time, but have leather seats. Train is best. Not advisable to drive in NYC unless you are familiar with big city traffic. My family of three (teen daughter 15) will be arriving NYC on Saturday before Thanksgiving and departing Thanksgiving late evening. I have always wanted to see NYC at Christmas. I know it\\'s a little early but I am sure most of the decorations will be up. We plan on doing the Rockettes Christmas show. What Christmas decorations should we not miss? Thanks! The Rockefeller Center tree will likely not be up on Thanksgiving Day, but store decorations likely will be. I suspect an early Christmas shopping season this year to make up for the Covid period. My favorite Christmas decoration is the large Baroque Angel Tree in the center of the 1st floor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It\\'s inside & the atmosphere is much more contemplative. Alas, I don\\'t see any note on when it will go up this year. I understand there are some at the Met who would like to give the tree a rest for a few years, but public expectations may overrule them. If they allow the viewing of the big Thanksgiving parade balloons as they get blown up the night before thanksgiving that would be good to see. They line them all up on the blocks around the AMNH and they gradually get bigger and bigger as they are blown up. Worth a look if you’re not going to the parade itself. And if the parade is on this year. Things sound positive so it should be. We plan on doing the parade. That has been on my bucket list of things to do. I also want to see them being blown up. I was thinking about going to the AMNH museum on Wednesday before Thanksgiving and then we can see the balloons being blown up. We are staying at the Hilton Midtown on the parade route and I heard they block off an area for their guests.\\nAny idea if the store windows will be decorated and showing before Thanksgiving? I know the Rockefeller Christmas tree will not be lit up (if even there). I also read that Rolf\\'s German restaurant does amazing Christmas decorations. We would love to see that. You can certainly go to the AMNH on the Wednesday but you won\\'t be able to see the balloons from there, even from any of the windows very clearly. In past years they blocked off any outdoor terraces for outdoor viewing and the trees blocked the view for the rest. (Maybe they will allow the terrace to be open this year but who knows).\\nAnd to get to the viewing and security entry point for the balloons from the AMNH you had to walk down Columbus Ave (the back from the museum entrance) to 71st St or so. That\\'s the parade viewing entry point where there is security and then a long pathway up Central Park West back to the AMNH where the balloons are, because of crowd control. It\\'s a convoluted walk even though you\\'re right there at the AMNH at the start.\\nAs I say, that was the past years\\'s process. This year could be different but I\\'m thinking it will be the same due to reducing crowds. They may even have a ticket system this year to control the crowds.\\nKeep an eye on the Macy\\'s website for up to date info: https://www.macys.com/social/parade/\\nIf it was me and the process is the same as previous years, I would go elsewhere on the Wednesday unless you\\'re prepared for the long walk from the museum down to the entry point then back up to the AMNH. Crowds can be fierce. All the major department stores will have their elaborate and impressive Christmas windows up. Re #3 I don\\'t know about others at the Met, but I have heard former head Philippe de Montebello hated the tree, apparently didn\\'t think was up to Met\\'s standards, and wanted to get rid of it but was convinced otherwise by other Met officials who saw it as a big revenue generator. Rockefeller Tree is the best. Likely not lit till first week or so in Dec. Saks and Macys windows are incredible! Walking down 5th Avenue is magical at Christmas. Bryant Park always is decked out too. Went into the city for the first time since the pandemic. It was a beautiful day, no humidity and even got a good parking space, which is always a joy! Walked into Washington Square Park , then walked to Chelsea Market which was not wall to wall people. We had good coffee at\\nBoun I’talia and they had a variety of milks if you’re into that. It’s right by the bathrooms, which is always nice especially when you’re traveling in New York City. If you exit Chelsea Market at 10th Ave you’re right by Little Island. Both my husband and myself just loved Little Island. We stayed about 2 hours. Walked around and then\\nate at the concession stand. There were plenty of tables and the food was nice and reasonably priced. We had a crudités with dip and a charcuterie platter. They have wine and beer but we just had water and seltzer. The bathrooms at Little Island were really nice, especially since it’s new. Little Island is right by the City Winery. It’s a nice venue to hear music or eat. They had a nice seating area outside. I would suggest this area for a nice day in the city.,Also of course The HighLine is right there too.\\nIt’s a great area to just walk around. Plenty of restaurants around also. It was great to be in the city on a spectacular day. As the tourists come back it will be more crowded but that’s New York City! Welcome back tourists! Sounds like you had a great day, thanks for the report. Thanks for the report. Is Little Island like a park or is there something to do other than enjoy the scenery? Very nice report, thanks for sharing. Little Island is a park but they are also going to have concerts. They have a small amphitheater there. I will be flying into NY and staying for 10 days. I take a lot of Rx meds plus some medically necessary OTC drugs. If I take everything in the original containers to show the Rx labels, I’ll be carrying about 20 bottles! I take 117 pills per week. Is there some other way to legally and safely fly with meds? I have 5 different doctors and don’t have paper copies of the Rx slips because everything is submitted electronically now. Only one of the meds is a controlled substance. I\\'ve never had anyone look at my meds and I don\\'t bother with original containers when I travel domestically. There are no customs inspections entering NYC from other parts of the US. Paper prescriptions have not been used by doctors in NY State for a number of years. Things are sent electronically to pharmacies to avoid fraud. Unless you consider it much easier to bring the bottles, I wouldn\\'t do that. Bottles tend to open up in your travels (been there, done that,) What I would do is bring your meds in zip lock bags - either divided by day or by type of med. For extra protection, I\\'d put those all in one bigger zip lock bag with a piece of paper where you have written down all the info from the bottles (med name. rx#, doctor & pharmacy info.) Thanks, I was concerned about the sheer amount of bottles that I\\'d need if I had to carry them in the original containers, and putting them into a plastic bag with printed photos of the med labels might do the trick. Your answer made me think of printing them. I\\'ll have them in my carry-on to avoid problems with lost luggage, etc. Just wondering how medicine bottles can open by themselves during travel. I have trouble opening bottles when I want them open (push down and turn). They will never open by themselves. Also, I have pills that if they are not kept in the original brown or totally light proof bottle will turn color. I have heard of people who were stopped by police and had the devil of a time because of medication not being the original bottle and could not prove that it was prescribed by the doctor. Just throw the bottles in a bag and go. What\\'s the problem? Why don’t you just stop taking like two thirds of the pills you are currently doing and leave them home. That way you will not raise as much suspicion and you will be able to do a little experiment in which you can see if you do in fact need all those meds or whether or not you are being bamboozled by doctors. I don\\'t know how the bottles opened during travel but they have so I don\\'t bring bottles with me any more. I either use a pill organizer or zip lock bags. I would not be taking the controlled substance out of its original bottle. Chances are nobody is going to look, but if you have the prescription bottle with your name on it etc then there won\\'t be an issue. If you have a controlled substance in a ziplock bag and can produce nothing that says you have it legally then you are kinda daring fate. People fly around with meds all the time, but I would be more cautious with controlled substances. Jenny P, you say you are from Florida. Only security will see your bags. Or, are you flying into NYC from another country?\\nCould you put the meds into a daily pill container or two; and taking photos to bring with you is a good idea.\\nBe sure to bring MORE meds than you need for the duration of your trip. You never know when there might be a delay. My wife always brings a list of precriptions from her pharmacy when travelling ...she also always brings the original containers to ensure there is no confusion...better safe than sorry. Hi everyone. I\\'m sure there must be a FAQ someplace but I\\'m not seeing it.\\nI\\'m flying into Newark the second week of July with two teenage daughters. We arrive about 7:30 pm and will need ground transportation to the Beacon Hotel on the upper west side. Since we are checking bags I\\'m guessing it will be more like 8 pm.\\nIs the best option just to grab a regular cab? I don\\'t care about the very cheapest option. I just want to get there as quick and easy as possible with a minimum of hassle and hopefully pay by credit card. I don\\'t normally do Uber and don\\'t even have the app on my phone. Get a cab from the dispatcher line https://www.newarkairport.com/to-from-airport/taxi-car-and-van-service All of the info about getting to and from all of the airports by every means possible is in the first of the Top Questions on the right hand side of the page (can\\'t be seen on a phone though). https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13187699-How_do_I_get_from_the_airport_JFK_LGA_EWR_to_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHowever, I would do as Kaye said (with luggage and several people), follow the signs at Baggage Claim to ground transportation/taxi, get in line and get a cab. That\\'s exactly what I would do. Note: 8ish should be fine. But there\\'s been a shortage of cabs lately, the later it gets. If you think your plane is going to be delayed, call Carmel or Dial 7 while you\\'re waiting in your airport of origin and book a car to pick you up. I waited close to an hour at LaGuardia last week for a cab, and there was still a long line behind me when I left. The regular cab will be approx 110 USD. UBER/Lyft approx 75-85 - but will take some time (10-15 mins wait).\\nThe train + Subway/va to UWS will take a lot of time!! Just be sure to get a cab only from the official dispatcher who is standing at the far end of the line from where you enter. They will have ID you can check to make certain they\\'re legit. The Newark Airport website lists taxi wait times.\\nhttps://www.newarkairport.com/\\nAlso note: \"The local taxi commission automatically adds a $5.50 surcharge to all credit card transactions.\" (Included in the link in #1.) We plan on visiting first thing in the morning.\\nI can see it opens at 9 am however, I know there is security to go through beforehand. Is it security that opens at 9 am or, is it the first ferry over that sails at 9 am?\\nIf it’s the ferry that sails at 9 am, please could you give me an idea as to what time we should arrive to get through security? We plan on booking tickets direct (hopefully also getting the crown) so not planning on exchanging any pass tickets if that makes any different.\\nHope that all makes sense and thank you. https://www.cityexperiences.com/new-york/city-cruises/statue/plan-your-trip/\\n\"It is recommended that you arrive approximately 30 minutes before your scheduled reserve time. The time on the reserve ticket allows entry into the screening facility not an actual vessel departure.\" Hey Valefan- why not ask the company itself? They certainly know better than anonymous volunteers not associated with the company. You didn\\'t say when you will be in NYC. The Statue\\'s interior (the pedestal and the crown) is closed due to the pandemic. If you will be in NYC when the pedestal and crown have reopened, be aware that tickets that include the climb up to the crown may sell out wa-a-a-ay in advance (months in advance during pre-pandemic times) because of the very limited number of visitors that can be accommodated on the steps and in the crown at any one time Crown tickets include admission to the pedestal and the museum.\\nPedestal tickets, which include museum admission, in normal times may also be sold out for several weeks, and if capacity is still limited at the time of your trip, they may not be available for a longer time. The museum outside the Statue should be more easily accessible, but it may also be limiting the number of visitors. So, you should book your SoL tickets as soon as your travel dates are firm. Don\\'t wait until you arrive in NYC and expect that you can get tickets. And book only at the official ticket seller and ferry operator, statuecruises.com, and nowhere else. Check its website for updates Just bear in mind that if you have crown access tickets then these must be picked up from the will call window on day of visit, so plan in plenty of time.\\nAlso make sure you have change for the lockers as you can’t take much with you.\\nI booked crown tickets in February for a July visit, they go pretty quickly.\\nMost of all Enjoy!!!!!! The more interesting SOL artifacts (original torch, etc) have been relocated to the new freestanding museum which is included in all tickets https://www.statueofliberty.org/statue-of-liberty/statue-of-liberty-museum/\\nIt is unclear what remains in the former museum space in the pedestal\\nBe aware entry to the statue requires a second security screening After extensive renovations, the NY Public Library\\'s Midtown circulating library branch\\nin the former Arnold Constable department store building diagonally opposite the main library at 5th Ave. and 40th St., has reopened. It\\'s name has been changed to Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library. (Guess who gave a big chunk of the money for the $200 million renovation.) The rooftop terrace isn\\'t open yet due to covid. And it\\'s not high in the sky like Manhattan\\'s observation decks. But hey! It\\'s free:\\nhttps://www.6sqft.com/after-200m-overhaul-nypls-central-circulating-library-opens-in-midtown-with-public-rooftop-terrace/?utm_source=6sqft+Daily+List&utm_campaign=09ccb920a6-Daily_776_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_ac79eda340-09ccb920a6-262765691 It will also, if it\\'s like it was pre-renovation and like so many other midtown library branches, be filled with the homeless and others looking for a place to hang out. It has actually been open for close to a year, but only for taking out and returning, not hanging out. Oh dear , We shouldn\\'t allow the public to be “ hanging out” in a Public Library. Now, if they would only bring back the books to the Main Library stacks. By \"hanging out\" I meant people with no place else to go going in and plopping themselves down and sleeping all day, depriving others of places to sit. I think it\\'s wonderful this resource is there for them and have said many times the renovation should have included plentiful showers for them as many smell like they\\'ve been dead for a couple weeks and I imagine they would appreciate opportunity to bathe (city announced years ago it was sending mobile showers to various hoods, but have never seen them in midtown). I agree with Fox that it\\'s a shame the library no longer has money for books, DVDs, etc, esp when requested by multiple people, not even for the replacement of stolen or\"lost\" items. I paid nearly $300 to join a private library where I get everything I want, and if there\\'s a wait, it\\'s a wait of a couple weeks, not a couple years.\\nEdited: 9:43 pm, June 07, 2021 Hi all- I realize This might be a sensitive post after the pandemic, but I’m hopeful that things are starting to return to normal.\\nI booked a bucket list trip to NYC for Thanksgiving with my family, 2 kids, 7 &9. Ive searched through the old posts and read countless articles. I’m also assuming things will return to normal in regards of the parade etc.\\nI need help answering a couple of questions…\\n1. We are staying at a hotel on the parade route. What time do the streets start opening back up? Immediately after the parade passes? We will head out for lunch.\\n2. Where do we get a “traditional” Thanksgiving meal. Bubby’s (Hudson) looks like a good menu but is it???\\n3. We plan on seeing the floats inflated. It looks like you meander a short route around the balloons? So you don’t just stop and look then go? Trying to guesstimate how much time I should plan to be there and when to go?\\n4. Do I get a City Pass? Reviews are really mixed about this… we plan to visit The Empire State Building, The Statue of Liberty and The 9/11\\nsite.\\n5. Is it a mistake to assume things will be back up and running?\\nI really appreciate your help! TIA 5. This one is difficult to predict. I keep my fingers crossed, since I want to book my next NYC trip but who knows?\\n2. Bubby\\'s is terrific. I haven\\'t been in NYC for Thanksgiving (nor do I eat traditional Thanksgiving meals), but as a general rule of thumb I think this is a great place and one of my \\'to go to\\' places in the city. Fun, good food for the category. Generally, I\\'ve seen many diners offering typical, traditional Thanksgiving menus. Bubby\\'s is a step up from many of the diners around imo. If you like their regular menu, I say go for it. I adore that place.\\n4. NO. For Statue of Liberty, you need to book directly with the official ticket seller. And buy those in advance! Crown tickets, if they\\'re open by then, regularly tend to sell out. Pedestal access too, although (in the past) not as early as crown tickets. I would book ESB tickets through the official seller as well. Typically, with the passes, you get a voucher that you need to replace for a ticket. This does not work well particularly for places like Statue of Liberty where you want to pick your time slot in advance. For 9/11, do you want to visit the musueum (ticket needed) or just the memorial with the memorial pools (free)? Many people feel the 9/11 Memorial Museum is not for young children. The 2 core exhibitions can be too emotionally distressing to kids under 1 0. You will have to decide whether yours are ready for them. Here are 2 discussions about the matter:\\nhttps://www.travelingmom.com/travel-advice/the-9-11-memorial-museum-in-new-york-city/\\nhttps://mommypoppins.com/9-11-memorial-museum-kids-visiting-families-tips\\nThe 9/11 Memorial Museum is below the street level plaza that is called the 9/11 Memorial. The Museum requires timed tickets purchased in advance. The Memorial plaza is free and does not require tickets. It has the walls showing the names of the 9/11 victims and outlining the sites of the Twin Towers. You should consider taking a Museum tour that is aimed toward kids and families:\\nhttps://www.911memorial.org/connect/blog/visiting-kids-911-memorial-offers-programs-young-visitors\\nEdited: 7:06 pm, June 07, 2021 The warnings about kids and the 9/11 museum is kind of interesting: I’m an adult and know I don’t have the stomach for it. I lived it - don’t need to revisit, I would have nightmares. I think there are many under 12 year olds who would handle it better than I would. Some kids can do it. Some couldn’t. But I still have Nazi nightmares and have had them my whole life - maybe from seeing some Holocaust documentary movies when I was a child.\\nThe 9/11 site, however, is beautifully done. Your children will appreciate it.\\nEdited: 7:32 pm, June 07, 2021 For myself, I wouldn\\'t want to 2nd guess the folks who run the museum & they recommend the minimum age is 10 for entrance to the museum. If the OP has been to the museum without the kids & think they\\'ll be fine, that\\'s one thing, However, I wouldn\\'t bring kids under the suggested age set by the folks at the museum without having personal experience attending the museum.\\nEdited: 7:47 pm, June 07, 2021 Great to have an advisory...great for parents to know their own kids. (and I\\'m still not going).\\nBut I think the OP just wanted to go to the \"site.\" And for that, it\\'s fairly self explanatory and kids of all ages should and could see it. In past years the parade balloons were lined up around the AMNH and viewers had to follow a set path to get there from a few blocks away and view them after going through security. Once you were at the balloons you could stay as long as you wanted. On our upcoming visit to NYC in a few weeks on one of our outings I am looking at taking a taxi with my sister. Both my sister and myself have some mobility issues and thus I am trying to maximize our walking. One of the places we need to go is our hotel (The New Yorker) to Grand Central. I went to a website that figures taxi fares and from the info I put in it came back saying it would be about $8 which seems kinda cheap to me. We would be taking this taxi around 10am on a weekday and there would be two of us. Is that a fair assement of the cost? How do I know which street to catch the taxi on since my hotel is on 8th and 34th street.\\nAt that time of day on a weekday how long would it take for a taxi? Would the hotel be able to assist me in getting a cab or would we be on our own? from the New Yoker to Grand Central isn\\'t that Far, its only about a mile.\\nYou can hail a taxi anywhere, Just raise your hand when you see one with the light one Time: btw 10 min and 30 mins. Always depends on traffic and what\\'s happening around the city.\\nAnd the fare will be approx 12-15 bucks. Incl. tip. (i was living across the New Yorker Hotel) Call down to the front desk just before you head down. Ask them to hail a cab for you. By the time you get down, they will probably have one waiting. Do tip the person who hailed it for you.\\nYou can also follow the instructions above. The fare will depend on traffic. The meter keeps going even if the taxi is sitting still. It could cost $8-$15 IMO. You tip the driver about 20% of the fare. So if the fare is in fact $8, I\\'d give the driver $10. If the hotel has a door man, he can hail you a taxi, but then you,d tip him something ($1).\\nWhile I\\'m sympathetic to your problem, just warning that if you taxi everywhere, it will be an expensive trip. Thanks for the advise. What form of payment due the taxi drivers prefer? I will have both cash and card handy and can you pay for the ride with a card and them tip them with cash or do they prefer doing everything via debit or credit card for safety reasons. I often tip servers in cash. But if I pay for a taxi ride with a credit card, I just put the tip on the card. I’m pretty sure most prefer cash, especially for short trips, so if it’s all the same to you, use that. But you shouldn’t hesitate to use a card if that’s easier or feels safer for you.\\n(This is based on conversations I’ve had with car service drivers and also my experience with immigrant-run small businesses generally. The fees charged by the credit card companies eat into their already-thin margins.) If you want to use a card then use a card. I only use cards. If you use a card, during the process it offers options for a tip (i.e 20%; 30% etc.). When I first saw that, I was offended but you can either put in your own amount or put no tip Andaz pay that in cash. I need reading glasses, so if you do and intend using a card, have them out and ready with the card.\\nBtw, not sure anyone answered about the time to travel Nd it really depends on traffic. Google maps estimates 6-16 mins. If you,re catching a train, allow plenty of time. I do not use cash in NY... Park Central Hotel New York near 7 Avenue Subway Station. The flight departs at 7 am on Sunday 6/6 from JFK to San Francisco. How easy would be to find a taxi? Should I book something in advance. Take subway? At that hour, my personal preference would be pre-booking a car service. Dial 7 and Carmel are both reputable. I would try to stay the final night at a hotel near JFK like the TWA Hotel Shift change for Yellow cabs is around 4-5 am & pm so availability may be limited\\nBooking a car service is safer Final costs are usually similar\\nI\\'d book ~45 minutes before you want to be at the airport\\nThe subway system is back to running 24/7 but runs less frequently overnight Agree w Kaye. If you book w Carmel, you can ask them what time they should pick you up to arrive by a certain time. I\\'d probably book a hotel at the airport for that early. If not then I would book a car service. Trains run slower on the overnight and it will be a sunday morning. I wouldn\\'t risk not being able to find a cab, unless you are willing to get up extra early to make sure you have time. On arrival I talked with the doorman and he told it\\'s easy to catch a taxi at 4 am at the hotel location. We stepped out at 4 am and and 5 minutes later we were riding to JFK. So helpful that you reported back. Hope you had a great visit. This will help everyone make better recommendations. I was going quite frequently to those airports in the morning. Typically ended u with an Uber or Lyft. Slightly cheaper and a wait time of max 5 mins. I\\'m booking a night in NYC with my wife and have narrowed it down to these two hotels. I\\'m looking at either the Premier Studio or Hudson Suite at Ink or Deluxe King River view at the Standard. I\\'m torn as I think the room at the Standard will be better, however, the fact that the Top of the Standard is currently closed makes me want to book Ink instead. Does anyone have anythoughts? The rooftop at the Ink48 is fun. I think that would sway me. I think it really depends on what you plan to do and when you,re coming. The Standard is a more interesting location imo and has a pool and lots of restaurants and clubs nearby. ***The Standard is a more interesting location imo and has a pool and lots of restaurants and clubs nearby.***\\nThe rooftop bar at Ink48 is great, but the location of the Standard is far better. I stayed in a Hudson River Suite at Ink48 about 7 years ago and it was amazing. Not sure if the rooms have changed but it had an incredible view over the river (could see boats/cruise ships), great bathroom, and nice separate sitting area. It\\'s definitely a hike away from most things you might want to do and the surrounding area didn\\'t have a ton going on, but on pure hotel experience it was great. I would love to stay at the Ink48 one day. The rooms, view and rooftop bar all appeal to me but the big downside of that hotel to me is the lack of subway station nearby. It\\'s at least a 10-15 min walk and to me that\\'s a big negative for me. There are buses and taxis and Ubers etc but to me having a subway station nearby is the big plus when choosing a hotel.\\nIn this case I would choose the Standard. Love the location there. You sound like you\\'ve pretty much made up your mind, and that\\'s fine, but for the benefit of others who may be considering those or other hotels in that area, keep in mind that once you get over to the far west side -- 10th, 11th, 12th Avs -- you are some distance from subways, will be relying more on buses for public transit, and may face some expensive taxi rides as those crosstown blocks can really run up the meters, so make sure you\\'re comfortable with those things. What does your wife like? It’s only one night. For me- Standard all the way, the area is fun, plenty to do, good restaurants and shopping, it has a buzz. I personally would care less about a hotel rooftop since there is so much else to do nearby. But what would she like? Location of Ink is a wasteland. Nothing close by. Opposite of the Standard where there is so much within a short stroll. The wife and I stayed there one long weekend for an in the City mini staycation two falls ago. We were there the weekend before Halloween. Was tremendously fun time to be in the Village. Hotel was great. The one thing she really hated was the glass wall of the shower facing out into the bedroom. Depending on how much of an exhibitionist you are that\\'s an interesting feature to keep in mind. I loved it. I could shower, look out the glass wall of the shower through the window of our room and up the highline. Room was a marvel of yacht like wood fitting. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guideline limiting each user to a single forums screen name.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 7:39 pm, September 10, 2021\\nEdited: 7:39 pm, September 10, 2021 For Fall trip, good rates at both hotels a block apart.

Stayed at Hyatt House Chelsea a few years ago. Loved the view from the room (ESB) but also spectacular views from public spaces on I believe the 11th and top floors. Not sure if they\\'re still available, but would definitely book there again, just for that. No need to go to a rooftop bar, take your own beverage and enjoy! Since you mention wanting quiet, a few people mention for Cambria that in some rooms, you can hear the people next door.

There is no information because there has been no updates. There really is no point in daily/weekly updates that basically say the same - no change.\\nI would start making alternate plans.

Thank you both. We can cancel until the end od june. And we already have Croatia planned as a alternative. It seems we will have to focus on that. July will likely not happen... Nobody knows. I wouldn\\'t count on it being anytime soon with the newer indian variant in the UK and their talk about going into a third wave. Too many people in the US remain unvaccinated and a variant like that if it were to be spread by large numbers would be a setback for the US.

Lots of restaurants are open, but if you want a specific place you should make a reservation.

Hello everyone.\\nI\\'m planning my travel from Hong Kong to Durham, and I need to transfer in New York.\\nThe transfer will be like:\\n1. Dubai (DXB)→ JFK, arrive at 19:00, with 80% chance delay for average 20 min ;\\n2. LGA→RDU, domestic flight, take off at 21:15.\\nSo roughly I\\'ve got nearly 2 hours between the two flights\\nBTW: With luggage, never been in US before.\\nDoes it seem at least possible to you? I\\'m looking forward to your advice.\\nEdited: 4:23 am, June 05, 2021 Well, look as if I underestimate the time needed for security and immigration check at JFK:\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k11017815-o10-From_Laguardia_to_JFK_in_less_than_2_hours_18_minutes-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nGuess I have to alter my plan Any ticket that changes airport probably isn\\'t the easiest connection. Also, there isn\\'t any simple public transportation from JFK to LGA.\\nI\\'ve just done a random search from Hong Kong to Durham, and there are options that go through SFO, ORD and YYZ (Toronto, Canda), that would be a one change, and no airport change.\\nI\\'d recommend Kayak to search for flights...\\nM Nope.\\nImmigration, luggage and leaving the airport will take btw. 30-75 mins (that\\'s my guess. Esp. during covid times and in T4 where EK arrives). Best transfer btw. JFK and LGA is likely a cab/UBER/Lyft and will take 25-50 mins. You don\\'t have 2 hours 15 minutes, you have to calculate based on when your luggage needs to be checked in before your JFK flight. It\\'s probably 45 minutes before take off, so you have 90 minutes to get to JFK and get through the line to check your luggage. @M4RKM\\nThanks. Perhaps a 2 changes plan is more suitable for a cash-pinched student like me:)\\nI\\'ve decided my whole journey will be like: Shenzhen (By ship lol) →Hong Kong (HKG) →Istanbul (IST)→New York (JFK) →Durham (RDU).

The food was…tolerable (?), but the atmosphere/fun was high. Going in a week and a half with both daughters. I know my youngest would love it. Does anyone know when they’ll open? Still seems closed according to the website? On Yelp, it says that they are planning to open in mid August. Ah! Thank you! The website wasn’t as clear. Still closed for now but seems like it will open soon as well. I think this is interesting. Exactly my cup of coffee.\\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/met-live-arts/sonic-cloisters-series\\nSonic Cloisters, a series of site-specific electronic music performances, launches this spring and features renowned and emerging electronic music artists recorded in the unique spaces of The Met Cloisters. Created specifically for digital platforms, Sonic Cloisters emphasizes the look, feel, and sound of the Cloisters as the inspiration and starting point for new electronic music. Freed from the confines of the dance floor, these artists interact with the Cloisters’ collection, architecture, and environment to explore new creative territory and compositional approaches. Interesting concept. Just looking at the link in the article, it would certainly suit the environment. Are they still mandated everywhere Or just indoors? Like can you walk around the city without one? Here in Southern Ca they are lifting the mandate on the 15th I believe this document from 2 weeks ago is still accurate: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-face-covering-faq.pdf\\nShort version for situations tourists are likely to be in: You have to wear masks on public transportation (including taxis). You don\\'t have to wear masks outdoors in most circumstances. Indoor public spaces, you need to wear a mask if you are unvaccinated OR the business owner requires them. There\\'s an unspoken etiquette developing...I have a mask on me at all times in public, but when I\\'m outside, it\\'s down, not covering my face. If I see someone approaching me wearing it, I put it on too. If I am in a crowded area - even outdoors - I put it on. Otherwise, I take a wide step away from people when possible.\\nMost stores have signs that say you need to wear a mask. You need to wear them in restaurants when you\\'re not at your table eating. I put mine on (if I\\'m fast enough) when the server or busser comes to the table.\\nI was out of town last week and in a store when the proprietor said \"if you\\'ve been vaccinated, you can take off your mask.\" That hasn\\'t happened to my in NYC.\\nThere are far less people wearing them outside than even a month ago, now that so many are vaccinated. But I\\'m actually surprised how many still are wearing them or holding them (the cool thing is to have it on your upper arm, it seems...I\\'m strictly a chin-guard person, to make it easy to flip up - I didn\\'t invest in a cool chain like so many of my friends). Plus I see people still have their kids wearing them since they\\'re not vaccinated.\\nMy mental checklist to walk out the door (keys, phone, headset, sunglasses, reusable bag in case I buy something) now has mask and sanitizer added to it. I keep sanitizer in every handbag now. You can walk around without out one when outdoors. Indoors for the most part are up to the business, but as mentioned above, you need them on public transit, etc. All right - but the number of people stille wearing masks is quite high in NY. ThAnks for the info! Sounds like it’s the same as here. We’re vaccinated as well but still required to wear it indoors at store’s or restaurants unless your at your table eating. We will still continue to wear them even when they lift the mandate on the 15th, can’t risk it with our little one not being vaccinated. she’s 6 If you are fully vaccinated you don\\'t need to wear a mask outdoors. If your not fully vaccinated then you are still under the original rules which requires masks outdoors if you are not able to socially distance from people which can be difficult to do on crowded nyc streets. Fully vaccinated people only need to wear masks indoors if the individual business requires them. Usually there is a sign on the door indicating if they require masks. Schools, transit system, government buildings etc mandate masks for everyone even if fully vaccinated. About half the people outside are wearing them and other half are not. In my experience most people in stores are wearing masks even if not required, especially the more cramped stores. At the gym it is about half and half but people there try to space out. No matter what you should always at least carry a mask because you never know when you may want to go inside somewhere that requires them. I agree with Risa and have not noticed a decline in mask wearing in Flushing. I expect this to be the case for some time. Stores still have their signs up requiring them. I’ve noticed a gradual decline in outdoor mask-wearing where I live (Park Slope, Brooklyn) - it’s accelerated over the last several weeks as people get more comfortable going maskless and transition into summer mode. At this point, I’d say only a minority of people on the street or in parks are wearing masks. Maybe 25-30%?\\nBUT masks are still required (by etiquette, if not law/regulation) indoors or even when approaching an outdoor window (e.g., to order ice cream or whatever). It could be my imagination, but it seems to me as though mask compliance on public transit has actually improved as outdoor mask requirements have relaxed. Maybe it’s easier to mask up on the train if you know you’ll be able to take it off when you exit. In SoHo there is very little mask wearing outside. I keep mine at my chin and pull it up when passing people and always in stores and on the subway. My 16yo always has hers on. Given the numbers of tourists from all over the world that have been flooding the neighborhood, we feel the safest thing to do is keep our masks on when possible. Singermaman, Soho is the worst. I know I wrote about that a year ago on this forum - crossing into Soho, I noticed less mask wearing, and then continuing down into TriBeCa, it picked up again. Still true. I don’t know why. But there are lines to get into stores and the stores require masks. We had tickets for Girl from the North Country in March 2020, but of course, our trip (and the show) was cancelled. It\\'s returning to Broadway in October of this year, and I\\'m hoping it will still be running when I visit in March 2022. I know it\\'s an impossible question, but would any of the TA Broadway regulars like to hazard a guess on whether it might still be running then? There is a web site called Show-Score which rates shows & this show gets a 75. That is a good but not great rating. However, it is a juke box musical which tends to do better. The show opens mid-October so I\\'d wait for the reviews & then check back with Shpw-Score to get a better idea of it\\'s chances. I\\'d guess there\\'s a very high probability it will be running in March.\\nMy unscientific rationale for this opinion: The show had already gone through its previews and opening before things shut down - so the producers had the opportunity to see how this production was being received. Armed with that information - they are now going through the work and expense to re-assemble a cast and re-launch the show - so that tells me they have confidence it has legs.\\nOn top of that, after a year plus, there is huge pent up demand that I think will help to float even not so good shows for a longer than usual time.\\nNo warranties offered, of course. You asked to \"a guess\" - so that\\'s mine. You\\'re right that it is impossible to know the answer but I would tend to lean that it will stick around. There were some people that thought it may not come back but I would imagine that since it decided to mount a come back, they might end up staying open at least until the spring (Tony Award nominations). It will all depend on the ticket sales.\\nDuring normal times, many shows close in January because that is slow season. Keep your fingers crossed and hope for the best. Nobbody knows what going to happend, there likely wont be many tourists in the fall, It will be mostly locals and extended locals (People from Suburns or dirivng distace) and shows that survive will need locals to go. Hi I’m a touch perplexed , should the usa go onto the green list what tests would be needed ?\\nOne before leaving the uk ? Then one when returning to the UK ? Or would i somehow need to get a test in New York ? How easy would that be ?\\nOr would proof of both vaccinations be possible ? It is unclear when the US will resume admitting non-essential travelers from the UK and what requirements for the testing and/or proof of vaccination may be when they do https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html\\nRegarding travel requirements for you to return home you may get more useful answers on a UK forum as that is a separate issue from US policy\\nIf a pre-travel test is required by your government - and possibly by your airline - testing is readily available but you may need to pay a premium to get test results in the prescribed time frame (usually 72 hours IIRC) Most of the UK Airlines have deals with various testing companies - they would send you the required tests includiing one to take with you , you then book a video call with the testing company within the required timeframe for return to the UK, do the test with them on the call and they will email you the results /certificate for entering back into the UK\\nOur testing package for Greece cost £90 for a PCR pre departure from the UK, Rapid Flow for the Return and PCR tests for days 2 and 5 once back in the UK\\nI\\'m sure as more travel resumes so will testing facilities making it easier for travellers\\nObviously the key question is when the US will allow international travellers, UK could give the Green for the US but with an increase in the Indian Strain in the UK I doubt many countries will allow us in at the moment The concept of \"green\", not to mention other colors used by UK government, is not something generally familiar to Americans. If you want to know what will happen if UK government decides US is \"green\" for UK travelers, you should probably ask UK government or on TA UK forum Be sure to check and print out WHAT tests your government will accept if you are required to test in NYC. Testing sites offer several different kinds, for different purposes, and you need to be sure they offer both the type of test and the turnaround time you need. Also be careful where you get tested here. Not only do some places not do it free, but they don\\'t take insurance and require debit or credit cards, no checks, no cash. Further, they may require you to be asymptomatic. In other words, they are specifically going for the international travel market, which might work out well for you, as they may be better informed as to the individual requirements of all the different countries. I am traveling quite frequently btw. NY and Germany. Antigen test is fine to traveling to the US (even as being vaccinated in the US). Gong back to Europe, I typically use a CityMD antigen test.\\nBut you will need to check the regulation set by the UK for high risk entries (likely PCR which can get quite expensive in NY w/o insurance (200 USD)) Hi\\nI\\'m super worried because I just bought a ticket for the MET for me, and I forgot to include in the checkout a ticket for my daughter who is 11. I thought that since she\\'s free I didn\\'t need to enter a free ticket in the checkout. Will she have a problem to be admitted? Since I haven\\'t been to the Met, nor NYC, since the pandemic started I haven\\'t checked. But are you able to book it seperately for free for her for the same time slot? I would contact the Met & beg & plead. We plan to visit New York in August. However we are afraid about attacking Asians.\\nIs it save now for Asian traveler ? There was another thread on this recently, with differing opinions...I’ll try to find it and post a link.\\nMy personal opinion is that the city is as safe - or safer - than anywhere in the U.S. That is not to minimize your concerns, or those of Asian-Americans who live here. Even one hate-motivated attack is too many. And assurances coming from non-Asians like me can seem overly-complacent or out of touch.\\nBut I can tell you that I have a lot (like, a LOT) of Asian friends, and while a few have experienced unpleasant incidents, and several have mentioned their concerns, they continue to go out and about - to parks, restaurants, etc. Here’s the earlier discussion (unfortunately, it kind of went off in some unfortunate directions):\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13536549-Is_NYC_Safe_for_Asians-New_York_City_New_York.html I am not asian, but I live in Queens which very asian there really isnt much of an issue around here The truth is, it is definitely less safe than it was a year ago and most certainly less safe than it was two years ago. If this undeniable and disturbing trend alarms you, assess your risk and act accordingly. To me it would depend on whether it is a trip I must make, or a trip I would like to take. Certainly there are better options where you would enjoy a more relaxed and stress free vacation until the situation stabilizes. The vibe and feel of the former City has been destroyed and it will take some time to see what type of culture takes its place...right now it does not look like a kinder, gentler place to visit.\\nEdited: 9:28 am, June 05, 2021 “ right now it does not look like a kinder, gentler place to visit.”\\n“ look like” is an interesting phrase.\\nDo you live in NYC? Or have you visited recently? I’m not sure where Sharks R lives or what neighborhoods they’re referring to when they talk about the “vibe and feel of the former City” being destroyed. All I can say is that’s not the case for the areas I’m familiar with - mainly Brooklyn - where, if anything, the movement of so much activity outdoors for pandemic-safety reasons has created a friendlier and more festive vibe on the streets and in the parks. I have no idea what the logistics of travel between the U.S. & Thailand are right now, but if you’re planning to visit the U.S. and NYC is on your itinerary, I see no safety reason to avoid it.\\nI was actually more worried when I learned recently that 2 Malaysian friends were planning to travel from NYC to my home state of Ohio - not that I feared they’d be physically attacked, but that they might encounter hostility or unfriendliness. Fortunately, that was not the case at all - quite the opposite in fact.\\nTheir experience reenforced the lesson that dealing in stereotypes - whether of NYC or rural Ohio - isn’t helpful. Yes there are problems with racism & anti-Asian attitudes in NYC and across the U.S. But most people continue to live their lives & enjoy the city.\\nEdited: 10:30 am, June 05, 2021 Agree w Linda. Overall, the city is joyful and exciting, w the reopening of restaurants, but with all of the increased street activity due to outside dining. The atmosphere is good, great, actually.\\nThat is not to diminish the increased number of anti-Asian and anti-Semitic acts - the increase is significant and horrifying. While I don’t mean to diminish it, as a percentage or likelihood of being a victim yourself. that is very low.\\nWe are in the middle of city wide primaries for public office. The number of Asian candidates is high. It’s a great thing to observe. When you ask a question like this here, you\\'re going to get differing opinions. The author of post #4 expressed his thoughts, but then right away, post #5 and #6 want to minimize or challenge his thoughts. It is quite possible that the author of post #4 has been seeing the news headlines for the past year or two, as he mentions that timeframe. Does it matter that he lives here or not, the author of this thread is asking a legitimate question, likely based off of seeing so many news stories about crimes.\\nOf course there is crime here, all cities have crime. And yes, most people continue to live and enjoy the city, but the quality of life has diminished somewhat.\\nThe homeless problem has been getting worse and worse for at least 5 years or so now. The pandemic did not help and what we\\'ve been seeing is attacks on people by those that really should not be out on the streets. People with long criminal pasts, drug problems, mental health issues, etc. The random attacks in the subways and on the streets are alarming in my opinion. Especially when these attacks happen in areas where they typically never happened.\\nCrime has been at the forefront of the news cycle here. It\\'s at the forefront of mayoral race as well. Far too many unprovoked attacks and those that want to push the limits, they\\'re doing it. Look at Washington Square Park for example, they have to close it early on the weekends. The squeegee people are back, and so on. The mayor is not focussed on crime in my opinion.\\nThis forum is a small subset of the population, get opinions here and also look outside of here to make decisions. I still believe the city is safe, but, you really have to be more vigilant than ever before.\\nHere are two sites that might be of interest:\\nNY1, for news, but this is their \"public safety\" page that has related stories:\\nhttps://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/public-safety\\nThe official NYPD Twitter feed:\\nhttps://twitter.com/NYPDnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Take a look at the posting history of #4 when assessing the statements\\nI think he may be an associate of someone supposedly from Hoboken “ The author of post #4 expressed his thoughts, but then right away, post #5 and #6 want to minimize or challenge his thoughts.”\\nNot minimizing or challenging. . Just seeking clarification. I’m interested in all of the opinions. But I don’t see it as a negative to ask someone if they’re reacting to news reports vs first-hand experience.\\n“ Does it matter that he lives here or not, ”\\nIn the context of experience, yes. To me at least. I suppose I could literally go to virtually any forum, search for local news reports about crime, and start a thread about how dangerous the place is for visitors.\\nEdited: 11:47 am, June 05, 2021 The Lehman Trilogy is returning, to Broadway, for 99 performances starting very end of September. Cast not quite the same (Ben Miles not returning this time). There is an AMEX presale for next 3 or 4 days. Great show see it. Arriving in 2 weeks at JFK, I was previously told you no longer need to take a Covid test prior to flying, just fill out the Health form, what is the website To fill it out? Here’s the form.

I got texts AND phone calls (that didn\\'t require responses) for a few days after. So random. And odd, because I\\'m vaccinated in NY and you would think they would somehow link that info! @Risa L: I wonder if it\\'s because you live there compared to us just visiting or something? Or maybe it\\'s depended on where we were coming from and maybe they do that for people that are arriving from more high risk states or something? Interesting though that they are doing that then...

Worth a trip IMO. Really? I tried that a week or so ago. I ended up tossing away the cone, it wasn’t worth the calories. And I was disappointed in the ice cream. It was a caramel flavor. Very sweet but not a lot of flavor. I thought it was more gimmick than quality. It looked really pretty though - great for the Instagrammers. I had the Italian cookie ice cream and loved the different textures and flavors. OTOH I tried the new Mr. Dips at the seaport yesterday and wasn’t impressed—the ice cream was too icy and the whole thing was messy to eat. Big Gay (still closed though) and Van Leeuwen on Front Street still win in my book. This is great to hear, and will broaden activities (& food options) for visitors, especially those looking for unique outside dining. Thanks for Sharing! The best cone I’ve had was a churros cone from ChikaLicious in the east village. Thanks to Ziggy, he’s missed around here. Two desserts in one that ice cream was. I must admit the flambed meringue sounds delicious.\\nThanks MTI. I agree it’s a great option for visitors. Walk around, eat some food, take in a neighbourhood or two. The Williamsburg and prospect park locations have been my favourites. Hi all! Taking my family (1 and 4 yr old boys and wife) into Manhattan on Sunday morning and was wondering about the easiest place to park car and enter Little Island. We are visiting friends in LI on Saturday and wanted to pop by to see the new park on our way home to Boston. Parking recommendations and any other tips about little island are greatly appreciated. TIA! I would use Sporthero or similar parking app to find best prices and availability near the attraction.\\nThere is another thread with posts up thru yesterday with info about tickets and the attraction\\nEdited: 6:31 am, June 04, 2021 Tips? Just go and enjoy. The weather should be nice....\\nHere are some pics from the opening day/week:\\nhttps://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/photos/little-island-opening-weekend?image=1 Icon has garages all over the city:\\nhttps://iconparkingsystems.com Hello! Apologize in advance for the long post!\\nMyself, my daughters (14 &17) and my sister will all be in NYC June 13-16 for a girls’ trip. My daughters and I have been multiple times before, and have seen many of the “major” tourist attractions. My sister has the main goal of “soaking in the city” (whatever that means...I’ve given up trying to plan any travel around her...lol!) While I want to have a generally relaxed, not heavily planned trip, I also know that having a rough game plan is a good idea. It is important to know we all love to walk & wander! If you have any input on this draft itinerary, it would be much appreciated!\\nSunday: Our flight leaves EARLY Sunday morning, arriving at LGA around 9:30. We will likely be quite tired, as the week before is the last week of school for my daughters and I (teacher), followed by friends visiting, a viewing of “In the Heights” Friday night (so excited!!!), and a few grad parties Saturday! Upon landing, planning a taxi or Uber/Lyft to Moxy East Village. I’m assuming we will get to the hotel around 11. I think mainly on this day we will wander the East Village, Chelsea Flea Market, and perhaps Greenwich Village (like I said, we like to walk!). In my head, thinking of dropping off luggage, heading to Katz’s (one place we have never been)? or somewhere else for brunch, then meandering from there. I would love for dinner to be Neapolitan pizza. SO sad Keste in Greenwich Village has closed, but thinking maybe Ribalta? Any suggestions for somewhere similar? Guessing we will be ready for an early night…\\nMonday: One request from my sister was to see Central Park (which I would happily wander through all day!). My youngest LOVES NYC bagels, anything close by to fuel up for the morning? She fondly remembers her first NYC bagel which was just from a small corner shop by our hotel years ago...the kind with sandwiches ready to go! Then take the subway to Central Park and wander there and through the Upper East Side, then make our way through the theater district and Times Square. Lunch...Halal? I was thinking of reserving Vessel/Edge reservations this evening at sunset (still available). I have Little Island tickets reserved for 9:00 pm (only time slot open). I know this would be a long day with lots of steps, but…sleep when you’re dead?\\nTuesday: Another request from my sister is to walk the Brooklyn Bridge. Thinking if Katz’s doesn’t work out Sunday, we could start our morning with a trip here, then take the Subway to Brooklyn. Walk around DUMBO. Perhaps lunch/nibbles at Time Out? Return to the East Village to thrift shop? Thinking this would be a good afternoon to walk part of the Highline and reserve a Sunset Cruise on the Schooner from Sail NYC?\\nWednesday: Our flight leaves LGA at 6:30 pm, so we still have most of the day to work with. Thinking of hitting any vintage shops we missed on our arrival date (are most open on Sunday?). Maybe another wander around Greenwich Village (my favorite!!!!). I’m thinking we should get a taxi/Uber/Lyft by 3:00?\\nA few concrete questions, if you’ve gotten this far:\\nDining: are reservations needed, or are most things open up enough?\\nNeapolitan pizza recommendations, besides Keste? So many great restaurants near the hotel...would saving Neapolitan pizza be better for a different night?\\nWould love to factor in a visit to Fraunce’s Tavern (big Hamilton fans so the history is interesting)...do you see a day it would be a good fit? Wednesday?\\nPlan to walk the area around FIT, my daughter’s #1 college choice...would this “fit” best on Monday? (Pardon the pun…)\\nAny other thoughts are definitely appreciated! Yes, I’m an over-thinking planner. And nothing makes me happier than vacation planning. This is my lightly planned version of vacation!\\nWe can’t wait to return!! For Neapolitan pizza in the East Village, my favorite is Luzzo\\'s on 1st Avenue. Motorino is also very good. Re: reservations...with a handful of exceptions, I’ve had no problems just dropping by places around me in Brooklyn, but I recognize it may be different in Manhattan, particularly for places that are more upscale or particularly popular/trendy. As always, if there are places where you have your heart set on eating, reservations (if they take them) are a good idea. If you’re looking at more casual places and are willing to go with the flow, I can pretty much guarantee that you will not be left hungry because you didn’t book ahead somewhere. Personally, I like the flexibility of NOT having reservations.\\nNo answers to your other questions, just the comment that it sounds like a really fun visit! There are three bagel places not far from the Moxy. Tompkins Square Bagels, Brooklyn Bagel and Coffee, Black Seed Bagels. Bagel Belly is on the way to Union Square where you\\'d probably get the subway up to Central Park. I might do Frances Tavern after the Brooklyn Bridge as the best way to walk the bridge is from Brooklyn so that you see the skyline of NYC. Try to get to Katz before 11:30 am as it can get very crowded. Your plans are all doable, but they are a little up and down and all over.\\nWalking around FIT would be logical on a day that you\\'re doing The Vessel and Little Island....it\\'s in between them, basically (a little to the east of them, but same neighborhood, generally).\\nTo Reserve or Not to Reserve: That is the Question. The better and/or more desirable the restaurant, or the more it it is a place you specifically want to go to, the more important it is to reserve (when reservations are accepted). Personally, I have two approaches: when I make plans in advance with someone, I book a reservation. Period. I have places I want to go to, and I will try to get a table. If they say \"we\\'re all booked, but you\\'re free to try \\'walking in\\' that night and seeing if a table is available,\" I book somewhere else. I prefer not to stand around waiting for something to open up, or walking from place to place (and as a tourist, you\\'re going to be doing enough walking. By the time you\\'re ready to eat, do you really want to keep walking to find an open table?). Then there are times I go out last minute, and of course, wing it. There\\'s always some place to go. Sometimes you get lucky with something good, sometimes you just eat at the first place with a table and it is satisfactory. When I travel, I do a combination of reservations and winging it, depending on what\\'s on my to-do list. So, it\\'s really your call. But on days when you have a lot of walking planned, I would think you would want certainty about sitting down at a certain time, at a place you actually want to go to. I am someone who reserves more often than not. But Manhattan and Brooklyn are sometimes two different worlds. (I had SUCH a good dinner last night at a place I reserved two weeks ago, wouldn\\'t have gotten a table otherwise)\\nAlso, I note that it sounds like you need to look at a map, to have a better understanding of where everything is, to adjust some of your plans. As blume notes, Fraunces Tavern is in the Financial District, south of the Brooklyn Bridge. So you may want to do that. And if you\\'re Hamilton fans, you should walk from Fraunces Tavern to Federal Hall, where George Washington was inaugurated after lunch at the original Fraunces Tavern (a short walk, past the New York Stock Exchange and Fearless Girl), and then go to the cemetery at Trinity Church (a block away) to see his gravesite. Black Seed Bagels, while made in NYC, are not NYC style bagels which OP\\'s daughter is craving. They are Montreal style. An entirely different creation. Your trip sounds very similar to ours lol. Mother/daughter trip as well. We get there the 15th in the am and leave the 18th. If you are big Hamilton fans the 2 places to go are the following\\nHamilton Grange is the only house owned by Hamiton its in Harlem and it doesnt appear to be open right now, but it is still photogenic\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPO28UWNaho/\\nThe Dueling grounds of the Hamilton-Burr duel are in NJ< but they are easy to get to, there is a ferry from 34th St and 12 Ave that goes to Weehauken, NJ (Its like a 10 min ferry ride), You will see a cliff when you get to NJ, at the top of the Cliff is the Dueling grounds (You will see a staircase, you need to climb them), Some awesome views of the NYC skyline from here\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CFtFiAYFaxa/\\nHamilton Statue with NYC Skyline in Backround\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CFtFTJMFIIE/\\nThese are the stairs you will need to climb from ferry, the Dueling ground is just to the left of the top of these steps\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CFGF5e0lPKc/ I was also sad to hear that Keste in the village had closed. It was one of my favorites. They do have an outpost in the Financial District too, if you want to head there for a pizza. However, as you know, you\\'re in a terrific location to find places to eat.\\nHave you walked the Brooklyn Heights Promenade on one of your previous trips? This could be combined with DUMBO and then Brooklyn Bridge.\\nEdited: 12:34 am, June 04, 2021 More great news and some solid acts coming this summer:\\nhttps://cityparksfoundation.org/calendar/?activeFilters=W3sibmFtZSI6IlN1bW1lclN0YWdlIiwidGVybSI6IlN1bW1lclN0YWdlIiwiYWN0aXZlIjp0cnVlLCJ0eXBlIjoiY2F0ZWdvcnkifV0=\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/06/04/central-park-summerstage-is-bringing-live-music-back-to-nyc/ This is awesome! Thx! We are thinking about going to the Battery on a Friday evening to walk around a bit before we catch the SI Ferry to see the sunset and night skyline.\\nI was looking for some reasonable priced suggestions for dinner. Toro Loco seems like a decent option but grabbing a slice or two might be better if we are time crunched.\\nAny suggestions for quick, easy places (not crazy busy) to grab a bit before the 8-8:30 ferry?\\nThanks! Check out the opening hours for these. Don\\'t know their opening hours in the evening.\\nTaim - if you like quick and casual Mediterreanen food.\\nNish Nush - same category for food.\\nGeorge\\'s (diner type food).\\nKeste does some good pizzas.\\nShake Shack has an outpost in the Fulton Street Subway hub complex (burgers)\\nEdited: 10:40 am, June 03, 2021 Toro Loco is fine. If you have time to sit down, The View restaurant, right next to the Staten Island Ferry, is a lovely spot. You can also go to one of the places on Stone Street, it\\'s close by. Adrienne\\'s Pizza may work for you. If you just want pizza to go, there are places nearby but I\\'m mostly agnostic on which is better. There\\'s one place very close to the Ferry, I forgot the name...I usually order from Pizza Etalia on Beaver St or Cucino Bene Pizzeria on Exchange Place, but those are a little further from the ferry. There\\'s pizza (and Italian food) on the SI side of the ferry, right across the street from the terminal, at Pier 76. You could go over and eat before returning on a sunset boat.\\nThere are also other restaurants besides that one, walking distance from the ferry. Los Tacos is only open til 3:30. Underground Pizza is open til 9. Fraunces Tavern is historic and has burgers and pub grub. There\\'s also Taombi if you like tacos. Broadstone Bar and Kitchen is a sit down with a little bit of everything on the menu, nothing spectacular or notable, but convenient. Ampia rooftop is a nice spot - it\\'s not very high, so not great views, but just a nice spot. You could also do Luke\\'s Lobster for take out. Thanks! Lots to consider! Brookfield Place has lots of cheap and quick foods if that\\'s all you want.\\nhttps://bfplny.com/food/ Thanks!\\nIt\\'s good to have lots of options since I\\'m not sure how much time we\\'ll have before our \"sunset cruise\"!!\\nFuku might just hit the spot!! If the weather is nice, you can pick up food from Fuku (or wherever) and walk over to the grass outside Gigino\\'s in Wagner Park (or if you have a little more time, you can eat there). It\\'s a great spot to watch the sunset.\\nKeep in mind that Brookfield Place is at least a 20 minute walk to the Staten Island Ferry. Map out your options so that you know your timing. Despite the rain it is nice to be back in the city. Haven\\'t been since Dec 2019. We got in Friday night on the train. Staying at Citizen M Bowery this time. We really only had time for drinks at the hotels rooftop bar friday night but it was well worth it. Also it was open until midnight. I think places have extended their hours recently.\\nSaturday we had tickets for the ferry to liberty island and ellis island so despite the rain we went out. I recommend doing the audio tour at ellis island if you have the time. Lunch at joes shanghai for the famous soup dumplings, dinner at Ivan ramen and a late night pizza run to prince street pizza made for a great day.\\nWalking through the streets Id say less than 50% of people are wearing masks outside. Most places still require masks to come inside but you can take them off once at your table. I cannot comment on the subway because we\\'ve been using uber to get around when the rain is too bad. Mask wearing still remains almost universal in Flushing---the Asian tradition of wearing them runs strong here. ***Walking through the streets Id say less than 50% of people are wearing masks outside.***\\nMasks are not mandated any more.\\nYeah, this weekend has been a washout, cold too. \"Lunch at joes shanghai for the famous soup dumplings\" How were the soup dumplings? Mask rules remain pretty much the same for unvaccinated people. Like you still have to wear masks if you can\\'t socially distance outdoors, but for fully vaccinated people there are many more places people can go without a mask and they don\\'t have to wear them outdoors. We got the pork soup dumplings (they also have crab). They were so good we ended up getting a second order of them. @4 I am glad to hear they were that good. Its a very well known place for soup dumplings. Day 2: a rainy day gave us an excuse to go to a coffee shop and people watch with some warm beverages. We went to johns of bleeker street for lunch.\\nDecided to escape the rain by going to the museum of natural history - reservations/timed entry required. About 1,000 other people had the same idea so it was crowded.\\nEnded up going to some bars and then finally got to try Rubirosa which was great (make reservations if you can otherwise there may be a really long wait).\\nHave really enjoyed being back in the city. Thanks for sharing your trip report. When we went to Ellis Island it was raining also. I remember what a mess it was sloshing our way out to the ferry. The historical exhibit, however was excellent. We were down this weekend as well, I have not seen weather as bad as this weekend.\\nWe got a reprieve for a short time on Saturday afternoon to walk from Little Island Park to the Conrad Downtown. Thanks for your trip report. @Fox11354, every Asian area I visited everyone had masks. From Flushing to Chinatown to Sunset Park to Bensonhurst.\\nMost people wore them on the subways (I took them all through the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan) and only a few from time to time didn\\'t have them on, but 99% did. August 20 through August 29:\\nhttps://www.autoshowny.com/ The auto show was a must do for my friends and I going as far back as the (late)Coliseum days. We would spend hours hanging out, taking pics and collecting the brochures that every manufacturer had on offer.\\nI haven\\'t been in years, but may return one day.

Look up the statistics and see if your safety is worth a trip to a stinky dump dying daily. Well, it appears the vaccine pass app for NY State does not work for most people according to Google App Store Reviews. Most people who are vaccinated claim the app fails to work, allowing them access to ball games and other large events. I assume these venues also allow vaccine cards as proof of vaccination? Or do they just force you to pay for a rapid COVID test if you cannot get the app to work? This question is for anyone with first hand experience going to a ballgame or event requiring vaccine or negative test. At least per the Mets website, you can show your vaccine card or even a digital copy of your vaccine card. That is what I am planning on doing this year. Leave the original at home, bring a copy, and have a photo of the original as well. Just tested the app. I was able to download it and retrieve a pass in less than two minutes. It asked me for my name, zip code and date of birth. Then it asked me verification questions such as date of last dose, county I received it in and which vaccine and that was it. Very easy to use. It gave me a pass that is valid for six months. The app only works if you were tested in or fully vaccinated in New York, If someone doesn\\'t have the app people are able to show paper documentation of negative test/vaccination to access venues.\\nEdited: 10:50 am, April 27, 2021 Red, that must be it! It doesn\\'t work for people from NJ and other places except for NY. At least they accept the COVID vaccine card as proof. I wonder if they would accept a pic of your COVID card on your phone though? It wouldn\\'t work for me, unfortunately. After I entered my name and DOB, it then asked me 3 questions. One question listed a series of dates and I had to pick which one was the date of my second shot. However, it didn\\'t have the correct date. All of the dates were in December, one of which was the date of my first shot, so I tried picking that date but it didn\\'t work. I emailed their tech support and they said that I would have to use my vaccine card as proof instead. They made it sound like they will always accept alternate proof if the app doesn\\'t work. The app has terrible reviews in the google store. Such a waste \"I wonder if they would accept a pic of your COVID card on your phone though?\" I think so as long as you have front and back with all the info clearly displayed. When I got vaccinated for the first dose they told me to take pictures of the front and back of the card and then I could show my phone for the second dose if need be. NY Vaccine app is working just fine. Also, my hospital advised me that I can show my electronic health record and it should work fine too. Ok, thanks for the info Red ISDW, not according to the google app store reviews. The app has a very low 2.7 rating.\\nEdited: 6:17 pm, April 28, 2021 Fair enough...I just checked mine and asked my friend. To be honest, I didn\\'t have to use it anywhere thus far.\\nEdited: 6:24 pm, April 28, 2021 We are in NYC for 2 days (including arrival day and departure day, but we take the train from CT so it\\'s easy in/out).\\nSaturday 6/12\\nTimed 12pm entry to MET. My kids (15, 19) then want to spend a bunch of time in Central park; Strawberry Fields, Belvedere\\'s castle, etc. The only other thing they\\'ve requested to do is the M&M Store. So, that day is easy.\\nSunday, 6/13\\nTimed entry 10:30-11;30 the Vessel. Since i can\\'t get a time for the little Island, thought maybe we could head down there first the walk the high line to get to the Vessel right before 11:30;. So, if leaving from M Social hotel, what time would we need to leave (can do subway or uber) to get to the Little Island at what time and how much time do we need for the Highline in between in order to get to the Vessel prior to 11:30? The timed entry to Vessel is free but if i had to and it makes more sense, i could purchase a bit later entry?\\nThoughts, advice and input on how to handle that?\\nAfter that we plan to go to Greenwich Village and Nolita area for shopping, Washington SQ Pk, and just whatever.\\nTHANKS! According to Google maps, it\\'s a ~15 min. Drive between the hotel and Little Island or about 20-30 on the subway. The 12th Ave. bus is also an option with some walking at both ends. I think you,re trying to do too much before your timed Vessel tickets. What,s wrong with walking the High Line after? It will be more crowded but you will be more relaxed. nywhiz\\nI guess i was thinking since the High Line goes in between pretty much, it just made sense..... ?\\nMaybe i should just purchase Vessel tickets and for a bit later; they are not that much money. Then solves the timing issue.... It makes sense that way. It just seemed a bit too tight time wise, imo. Good call to try and get a ticket for the vessel a bit later. Going to the Vessel then walking the High Line down to it\\'s southern end puts you right in the West Village. From there you can walk to the Village and NoLiTa etc. The Vessel might take half an hour and the High Line walk takes about 45 mins all up. Check google maps Directions feature for the walk after that. You can add stops, change the route etc and it will give you timings. Going in 2 weeks. What’s better to get around in as first timers, Lyft,Uber or taxi from airport and city? 2. What is a good pizzeria in the south Midtown area? 3. What’s a good tour to do that will catch most attractions (empire building, Rockefeller center, 911 memorial)? 4. Good place to eat in Dumbo? TIA What airport to where in Manhattan? Wouldn\\'t recommend tours to see the stuff in your list just go to the attractions you are interested in. There is an entire food hall in Dumbo not to mention two very good pizza places.\\nhttps://www.timeoutmarket.com/newyork/ The subway is the way to get around and it is something you don\\'t have back home. 1. Depends on what airport you are flying into.\\n2. South Midtown? You are going to have to define that.\\n3. I also would not recommend a tour for those things.\\nYou also should mention how long you will be here. 2 weeks? You can easily do/see/visit this locations. 4 days? Also easy to visit. I was out and about in the city on Sat and Monday and passed Rock Ctr and the ESB without even trying.\\n4. DUMBO and the outskirts have loads of food options. As red noted, you can check out the market and sit upstairs/outside for some nice views while you eat/drink. If you are flying into JFK...as first timers.....I would take a NYC taxi.\\nGet to the official taxi line outside, jump in and sit back and relax as you approach the city! Taxi from the airport.\\nLots of pizza everywhere, please define a specific area.\\nWalking tours can be good if you like that. But not to all of those places you mentioned. Look at Free Tours by Foot.\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/new-york-tours/\\nThe HOHO buses do loops of many sights with set bus stops, but for the best experience, just stay on and see the sights from the bus and go back later if they really interest you.\\nJuliana\\'s in Dumbo has great pizza. https://julianaspizza.com/\\nThen check out Brooklyn Bridge Park. We’re flying in and out of JFK and will be staying at the Hilton garden inn on 28 St west. I’ve never tooken a subway so I’m a little afraid of getting lost lol How long will you be in town?\\nI would highly suggest using the subway during your visit....but splurging for a cab from/to the airport. Thanks for the great info Aynat and Ter! Also, where do I catch the Ferry to The Statue of Liberty? If you take a cab from the airport, tell the driver that you are going to \"the Hilton on W28th between 6th and 7th Ave.\" Hi all,\\nI am making a short trip to New York in late June. I\\'m staying in Chinatown and am very interested in shopping for sustainable fashion. I have made a list of some single-brand stores to visit (Allbirds, Coclico, Sezane, Cosabella...) but I am wondering if you could provide recommendations for others, or for stores that sell multiple brands with an ethical or sustainable focus? Your advice is much appreciated. I would stick with the resale shops for the most sustainable. Can you recommend a few? Buffalo Exchange is where we go Are you looking for recycled (used) clothing or new clothing produced in sustainable ways? If the latter, and you don\\'t get many suggestions here, I suggest doing a Google search. I just did one asking for something like \"\"NYC shops selling sustainably produced clothing\" and the link below is to one of my results.\\nhttps://linguafranca.nyc/pages/about-us As I thought about these shops selling handcrafted items I was reminded of a shop that used to be in Manhattan but is now long gone. It was called the Women\\'s Exchange and dated back to the 19th century days when women, especially unsupported women alone, had few ways to make money and having a cooperative exchange where they could sell hand made items could benefit them. The one in Manhattan, on Madison Av in 50s, grew to include a tea room. However times changed, rents went up, people were happy with cheaper imported stuff, and they lost the space on Madison, moved to 3d Av and ultimately I think went out of business. However, my Google search reveals that there is apparently still a Brooklyn version of that business operating in Brooklyn Heights:\\nhttp://www.brooklyn-womens-exchange.org/ Hi, haven’t traveled since Feb 2020. Has the construction-related traffic congestion to and from LaGuardia improved? Would you opt for JFK instead (LGA is closer). Thank you for your help and advice. I suspect traffic is down owing to the decline of passengers. I have not heard traffic reports of problems at LGA. In the past, these could be terrible. I think all or most of the construction is done now. I flew in and out of LGA 4 times during the height of the construction and only once was it slower than usual. It’s still my preferred airport. Your question prompted me to take the loop bus from Flushing to LGA. The roadways are now much better and airport entrances open compared to a year and more ago. I would describe traffic as light at 2:30 PM on a Weds. Other times could be worse. The only place with delays was at the east end by terminal D where construction vehicles sometimes crossed the road. However, these stops were not major.\\nI decided to get off the bus and look at the new Terminal B. It is attractive and very light and airy in appearance. The back wall has a long tile mosaic with white blobs on a blue background that I presume represent clouds. Interspersed among these are iconic NYC items. My eye was arrested for a moment by the sight on an onion bagel floating in the heavens. There is an interesting wire construction over an atrium to the lower level with a globe-like effect. The most dramatic work is in the corridor to the parking building. There is a long stretch of colored glass windows with NYC skyscrapers in various orientations. I am not quite certain how this was made as it is not the usual leaded stained glass. I understand the better things to see are beyond security which I could not cross as a non-passenger. Thank you so much for checking and for this detailed response! In case it is not too late, a new roadway at the east end of LGA, by the area of small delays I mentioned, was reported opened this morning. They even had a ribbon cutting ceremony. I flew into terminal B on Sunday night, landing about 11:30pm. I wanted to explore but was too tired. Good thing I didn’t. The construction wasn’t the problem, the cab line was...I think I waited about 45 minutes and there was still a line behind me. No Uber/Lyft available. Of course, it was rainy which made things worse.\\nThe terminal looked beautiful and if I fly out from there, I will try and get there a bit earlier to explore. Hello all!\\nMy partner and I are due to run the NYC Marathon on the 7th now that it has been confirmed!\\nWe\\'re flying from the UK (fingers crossed this will be allowed then!) and we\\'re looking to stay from October 30th to November 13th (2 weeks).\\nBudget is £100-£120 ($170) a night although we can go higher if need be.\\nIdeally I\\'d like to stay somewhere closer to the finish line as I\\'m sure my legs will appreciate it!\\nWould appreciate any comments on where to eat, things to do pre/post Marathon, and recommendations on where to stay etc.\\nCheers all! There aren\\'t a lot of hotels near the finish line and many that are there are very expensive (I.e. Mandarin Oriental).\\nThe Fairfield Marriott Central Park is about a 20 min.walk away and has a rate of $205/night including all taxes on their website., about as good as you\\'ll get at that budget. The Hudson hotel would also work but their standard rooms are really small. It\\'s a nicer boutique hotel though.\\nI think the best price value for your dates is all the way downtown in Soho and further south into the financial district.. There,s great running along the water if you stay downtown and you can get to the starting line easily from down there and take a taxi or subway after the race. A club room at the Sheraton Tribeca comes in at $203/night with taxes. I can’t speak to specific hotels, but I can share my experience running the marathon, which may help shape your own thinking. My basic message is the same as nywhiz’s: don’t worry overmuch about staying hear the finish. The first time I ran, I stayed at the Wellington, just south of Central Park. That location was fine, though I can’t even remember how I got there after the race. The second time I ran, I stayed at a friend’s apartment an easy walk from the finish. That location was also fine.\\nIn subsequent years, having moved to NYC (that’s how much I love the NYC marathon, I decided I just had to live here!), I’ve taken the subway all the way to my home in Brooklyn. And guess what? That location is fine, too. In fact, I view the post-marathon subway trip as a key part of the experience and wouldn’t miss it for the world. People will applaud you, you can share tired grins with other runners, even swap stories.\\nBottom line: find a place that fits your budget, is comfortable, offers nearby stores/restaurants, and is close to transit.\\nAnd have a great race! Thanks Nywhiz, appreciate the feedback. I think we might have to up our budget and have a look around. Really looking forward to being back in the city and running! Thanks Linda! Some really useful tips! My cousin also lives in Brooklyn near the Barclay Centre but doesn\\'t have the space to host! Are there any decent hotels in Brooklyn? Cheers and fingers crossed us Brits can travel then! I\\'ll be in NYC around the same time, and I\\'d really look at increasing that budget (I\\'m assuming it is not a per person budget).\\nThe Nolitan i got for £170 a night including taxes, The Williamsburg Hotel (in Williamsburg), slightly more, but under £200 a night.\\nThese are 4* and 5* hotels, so have a decent amount of amenities.\\nIf you\\'re staying for 2 weeks, (i\\'m doing 6 nights), i\\'d consider splitting into different areas, just for fun as you do end up staying nearer the hotel at times... get to see different parts of NYC.\\nM Thanks M4RKM, having done some research I think you\\'re all right, budget needs to be upped.\\nWe were considering visiting some other cities such as Philly and DC to break up the trip however it\\'s my partners first time in the states and I\\'m a big fan of NYC so it\\'d be good to take all the sights in and take it easy. I know my legs will appreciate it!\\nCheers,\\nAdam Philly is an easy day trip as it is only 90 minutes on the Amtrak from Penn Station. We\\'re actually doing that.\\nFor once I\\'m in town with others, and we\\'ve all done NYC before, and I\\'ve only done one Philly day trip. The finish line is towards the west side of the park and has a security zone https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/race-day/the-finish-post-finish\\nLook at hotels near Columbus Circle or on the UWS\\nIf you want to do DC and Philly consider flying into NYC and out of DC (or the reverse) and traveling between the cities via Amtrak P.S. If they do things the way they did previously there are specific exits for participants along CPW in the west 70\\'s & 80\\'s (see the link above) That sounds ideal! Have you been to any Basketball games before? As I think this is also on our list and something I\\'ve not done before. I may refresh this thread closer to the time and pick your brains on good places to eat too!\\nCheers,\\nAdam My wife is going to be driving from Rochester to NYC for six weekends. She will be taking a class in Manhattan on Saturday and Sunday. The class location is near Penn Station. Plan is to stay outside the city and take a train to and from Manhattan.\\nIt looks to me like NJ makes more sense as the trains go to Penn Station whereas Metro North goes to Grand Central. Am I correct about that? If so, what would be a convenient, safe, relatively inexpensive place to stay in NJ? I don’t need a specific hotel (although that would be nice), I’m more interested in a city or general area. Advice is much appreciated. You don’t say what your specific budget is, but the PATH train goes to Jersey City and Hoboken and if a very short and inexpensive ride. And the trains go often.\\nMetro north trains are on a schedule, it is more expensive, probably a longer ride, and yes( they arrive at Grand central. Consider a hotel in Jersey City or Hoboken near the PATH train - similar to (but separate from) the subway, cheaper fares, longer hours and the 33rd St terminus is only a block from Penn Station https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/schedules-maps.html As Risa mentioned, Jersey City or Hoboken. Either of those would work well and fit your needs. Just make sure that you pick somewhere that is walkable to the PATH. Thanks all, that’s very helpful. Pre pandemic, Driving and parking by the PATH is just as bad if not worse than driving and parking in Manhattan. Plus getting to the PATH involves more city driving than getting to a hotel in Manhattan right outside of the Tunnel. It can especially bad if they are doing work on the Skyway or Bay Extinction. Rochester is very far from NYC, and the distance is subject to bad winter weather. That said, it would be helpful to understand why she is staying outside the city. Is it because of fear of personal safety, Covid-safety, cost, or car acess/parking cost? PATH trains often have annoying service changes on weekends, and don\\'t go directly to very many places.\\nIs she willing to take a subway train after the PATH ride? Is the Covid-safety of the PATH train a problem for her?\\nIf you really want the best advice, you need to get her permission to list some more specific information (and which will not actual place her in any danger - this is a big city!) What will she do on her time off, if anything? Is she going to travel morning Friday or evening Friday, and so on? Is price/cost a factor? Does she love long drives?\\nNew Jersey is one extra river crossing, so time of day on that crossing makes a difference in the trip. Many low cost hotels in NJ are \"on the highway\", so they have nothing to do near them except shopping malls and chain restaurants. Does she care about that? Walking around Jersey City or Hoboken is cheaper than walking around Manhattan, but it\\'s not any \"safer\" and it\\'s very heterogenous \"urban\" for someone who drives a big SUV everywhere in the corporate suburbs of Rochester. It’s mostly a matter of cost. Hotels are cheaper outside the city. And she won’t have to deal with driving and parking in Manhattan. This is not a pleasure trip so entertainment, nightlife etc. are not really that important. What matters most are convenient, reliable transportation to and from her class, which is a short walk from Penn Station, and cost. Take a look at the \"weekend & holiday\" tab in the link in #2 when considering the convenience of hotel locations. The PATH does run differently then.\\nI don\\'t see any currently planned repair work that looks like it would be a problem https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/planned-service-changes.html Another option you might comparison price is the https://www.skylinehotelny.com/\\nIt is used by some forum regulars who drive from upstate and like it for the affordable parking rates for guests and that it is close to the Lincoln tunnel and West Side highway for minimal driving on the Midtown streets Definitely the NJ - Penn Station route. It\\'s faster and with longer hours. Hi! Early last month I bought NYC tickets to coincide for the Tribeca festival but it was a few days after the free tickets for the showings went up and I could not get a ticket for any showing. Question: Since the tickets are in public parks, can I just show up and seat in the grass (outside their seating area) and watch the movies? I mean, is there going to be a barrier or anything preventing anyone from seeing the screen? I mean, it really depends on the park/setup.\\nThe screen is 40\\' so viewing would vary. Do you know in what parks I would have a better shot of watching the film? I\\'m planning on taking the Hudson Line from Peekshill to Grand Central, and then either bus or uber to EWR. This is early on a Saturday morning (train leaves Peekshill about 4:57 AM). How likely is the train to run on time? I\\'m trying to figure out which flight I can safely make. Thanks for any info! I take this train often going/coming to from Beacon/GC. The Metro North runs pretty much on time.\\nDon\\'t think that the 4:57 will leave at 5am. It will probably be gone by then. The 4:57 gets you into GC at 6-ish. Unless something goes drastically wrong, you can plan to arrive at approximately 6am. Be at the station early.\\nJUST CONFIRM the schedule for your Saturday. Ex...I don\\'t see any trains for this Sat at that time. I didn\\'t really look...but confirm. Usually they are on time, but you may want to get a later flight just in case. If you walk or cab over to Penn station you can take New Jersey transit to the Newark air train\\nEdited: 7:33 pm, June 02, 2021 Two Saturdays ago, I was on that train and there was a delay.. This was a Sat evening train. Well, it ended up being approximately 30+ minutes...just sitting there.\\nWhen we finally got going, we saw emergency vehicles/lights near the track. Not sure what happened, but this was not typical in my experience. Double check the bus schedule as there have been a lot of changes during the pandemic.\\nAlso, on Uber be aware there has been a lot of surge pricing on airport trips, said to be due to driver shortage. So plan ahead. Hello,\\nWe are planning to visit NYC for the first time. We are a family of three with a 6 year old. We are thinking of a 5 day trip in the last week of June (6/29 - 7/4).\\nLooking for recommendations on which places are must visit. I have shortlisted -\\nBrooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty\\nCentral park, Intrepid\\nTime Square, Observatory, Ripley\\'s, AMNH\\nAre there any other places that shouldn\\'t be missed? Since we will have a kid along with us, we don\\'t want to make the trip too tiring by aiming to cover many places in one day.\\nThank you!!\\nRegards,\\nNeha Must do is different for everyone. If those are the things you have always wanted to see, then those are your must do’s and you should see them.\\nI’ve got a hundred other amazing things to see, but you don’t have time. I would suggest that you make a draft itinerary so that we can assess your plans. You\\'re off to a good start and can take in quite a bit in 5 days.\\nFor example, day one could be the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, Brooklyn Bridge, and some other downtown or Brooklyn attractions. This is assuming that you want to actually visit the SOL/EI, which I highly recommend. Reserve though Statue Cruises, the official vendor.\\nhttps://www.cityexperiences.com/new-york/city-cruises/statue/\\nDay 2 could be Central Park and the AMNH.\\nDay 3 could be an observatory, I\\'d recommend either Top of the Rock or the Empire State Building, Ripley\\'s, and other midtown attractions, etc.\\nDay 4 could be the Intrepid, maybe Hudson Yards, the High Line, Hudson River Greenway, etc.\\nThat leaves one day. As you can tell, it\\'s easy to fill days. What else interests you and your family? I\\'d ditch Ripley\\'s.\\nHead over to Rockefeller Center instead and hit the Lego store, Nintendo Store and Top of the Rock. You get a great view of the ESB from there as well as Central Park.\\nIf you haven\\'t reserved SOL you might be out of luck. Do the SeaGlass Carousel at Battery Park. You can take a boat cruise past the SOL if you would rather just have a look vs a climb. Looks like the crown is still closed so the highest you can go is the pedestal. You\\'ll have to decide if it is worth the time it takes to do security, travel, and viewing when making your itinerary as well as whether you think your 6yo will be interested. You already have some good museums in your itinerary, keep them. I\\'m sure they\\'ll be very interesting for the entire family. You could keep the last day somewhat open ended if you like, and add things once you see what you feel like doing that day (but have a few suggestions planned or prepared to choose from). One such thing could be the Met museum. I don\\'t think I would switch one of the museums you already have for the Met, but if you feel like adding one on your last day this might be something to do. Their Egyptian wing with the Temple of Dendur is interesting for all ages. Check to see if you need to pre-book timed tickets though - perhaps that will still be required when you\\'re in town. A cruise is a nice way to see the city, the bridges and the Statue.\\nSail-nyc.com\\nhas smaller boats where every seat is good.\\nDo you realize July 4th is our Independence Day with great fireworks? I would avoid traveling on that day if you can. Thanks! I am in the process of making one. I would love to have feedback on it. I will share it once done. Thank you! This is exactly in line with what I am planning. I want to leave one day for random things - maybe Coney Island, NYC aquarium.\\nI am relieved that I am on the right track. Your suggestions are helpful. Thank you for your suggestion. LEGO store was in my list. Regarding pedestal access tickets, I read that because of pandemic, SOL only has ground access tickets. Everything else shows unavailable on statue cruises website. May be I\\'ll call their helpline number and check. Met museum looks interesting. I just read about it and have out it in my itinerary.\\nThank you!! Hi - I am looking for a website with an up to date calendar of outdoor events happening in the city this summer. Can anyone recommend one? I have been looking unsuccessfully. Time Out still has a calendar up from April 2020. Looking specifically to find out if there is anything outdoors happening in June. Outdoor concerts? Outdoor movies in a park? I found some events in the Lincoln Center website but none for our dates of travel. Thanks! Since it is only 6/1, you may just need a bit of patience. I checked with NYCGO (the official tourism site for NYC) & they only have the beginning of the month. Since we\\'re coming out of a holiday weekend & a period where Covid restrictions are just being relaxed, they may be a bit behind on posting a new calendar. I have never found that there is 1 site that will be good for monthly events. It is usually a combination of sites/newsletters/etc that provide the best info, in my opinion.\\nA member Ztaks started a monthly NYC event thread a few years ago and I continued it pre-COVID. I was actually thinking of starting it back up as more events start to happen.\\nWhat are your travels dates? There used to be a great calendar called events12 listing events in calandar style for the next 12 months. I used that one a lot. They stopped updating it during the pandemic but you can sign up with them and they\\'ll let you know when it resumes.\\nhttps://www.events12.com/newyork/\\nIt might not be up and running for June 2021, but keep it for future visits. They update it for other American cities as well.\\nTake a look at this one, it looks like it\\'s listing a lot for June:\\nhttps://www.nyc.com/events/?int4=6 And seeing that you specifically mentioned outdoor events, these websites might help with that:\\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/street-fairs/\\nhttps://newyorkled.com/nyc_events_street_fairs/ Thank you, I’ll check these out! Hi we are thinking about driving ourselves to JFK for our Int\\'l flight instead of spending the money on a pvt ride from Conn. We\\'re not to savy on this did it once and used the \"official\" JFK lot and it was a bit of a hassle..looking for something a bit better and one that would pick us up & drop us off at our terminal. Since we\\'re not to familar with the area around the airport it would have to be very close and have good directions...Any help on a name or your own experiences would be most helpful We\\'ve heard of jfk long term parking inc..but this is not the airports lot..... has anyone ever used them? Thanks in advance PLEASE let me know if you hear anything!! I am looking for exactly the same information! There are several located right off the belt pkwy on the service road (south conduit). They are minutes from the airport. I posted this in another thread, but last time Smartpark was cheapest so we went with that one. We have used several along there and never had any problems. Thanks shoney....When did you use them last and what did it cost you.? If you dont mind me asking..We\\'re also trying to figure out if its really cost effective as well as the stress of driving ourselfs as apposed to door to door service The \"official \" jfk long term lot owned by the port Authority is no longer a hassle....Yes, it is more money than the others, however, it is somewhat secure & well-lit with direct access to the terminals via the air-train(monorail) Here is the link to smartpark\\nhttp://www.smartparkjfk.com/\\nWith kids and luggage, the monorail is a pain, imo. Also, if there is a bad weather. We prefer to go offsite parking with shuttle service now, it just seems much easier!\\nI used them March 2012.\\nEdited: 10 years ago -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post was determined to be inappropriate by the Tripadvisor community and has been removed.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nOur staff may also remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.

There IS a pickup D at terminal 4--that I know for sure.\\n3. I have no sympathy that you were cold. Yes, I understand that you went to the Caribbean BUT you were flying in and out of NYC so you need to be prepared. Reminds me of the time I was standing on the taxi line. It was a longer than usual line and it was probably below freezing out. There was a couple ( with child) who had no coats--they were moaning and groaning that they were cold and I think they were hoping that people would let them cut the line. No one did. Fact is, it was an early flight and many people, myself included, were going home, dropping a suitcase and going to work. If you fly in cold weather --dress for it! Here is a site that provides all parking services in the area.: http://www.aboutairportparking.com/new-york-jfk-international-airport-parking\\nA month ago I used Long Term Valet and had no problems. Most of the transaction is done on line and it was easy dropping off the car. Waited about 10 minutes for the shuttle to Jet Blue.

Any ideas on what state to fly into first? We’re going to be moving hotels after each state instead of going back and forth so we can enjoy the city. In New York we plan to do the typical Statue of Liberty, Central Park, M&M store, 9/11 monument. In New Jersey, we’re planning of going to the American Dream theme park and in Philadelphia we’re going to the Hershey Park. I would fly into whichever NY airport is cheaper/fits schedule/direct, and then fly out of Newark or Philadelphia. You don\\'t want to have to come back onto Long Island to fly out of JFK or LGA. Hershey Park is in Pennsylvania, about 2 hours from Philadelphia. Does that changes your planning? Hershey Park isnt near Philadelphia, Its near harrisburg I don\\'t know where you,re flying from or to when finished, but surely that should be the first thing you check. Have no idea where the theme parks are, but I doubt they,re near major airports. Keep in mind that Philadelphia is not a state, but a city in Pennsylvania. The https://www.americandream.com/ is the shoppertainment mall in the Meadowlands in NJ.\\nIt can be reached by transit from the PABT in Manhattan\\nIf going for more than a day trip not sure about nearby hotels\\nEdited: 4:10 pm, June 02, 2021 I posted this in your other thread:\\nFly into one of the three NYC airports, stay in Manhattan, and take mass transit to American Dream. You can take a NJ Transit train to Secaucus Junction from NY Penn Station, then an uber to American Dream. There is also direct bus service from the Port Authority.\\nRent a car and then head to Hershey. You could fly into any of the 3 NY metro airports but if you do https://www.hersheypark.com/ in PA last and have to return a rental car EWR in NJ will be much easier than LGA or JFK If the cost was within your budget, rent a car in the city, leave and head to Hershey, then return the car and fly out of Philadelphia. It would save you some time of coming all the way back here. Looking at flights should be the first thing you do, I agree with NYwhiz.\\nAssuming you are flying from Honolulu, flying into New York City area is the obvious choice.\\nHawaiian airlines has nonstops from Honolulu >Jfk.\\nAlaska airlines has nonstops to Newark airport. All depends on your your date of travel course.\\nHonolulu >Philadelphia is going to have at least one stop. I have never seen a nonstop available to Philly. We’re planning to visit these 3 states on 1 trip. Any ideas on what state to fly into first? We’re going to be moving hotels after each state instead of going back and forth so we can enjoy the city. A little more info would help, as the three states cover a huge area and set of possibilities. E.g., Does NY mean NYC? Niagara Falls? Cooperstown? Other?\\nEdited: 2:29 pm, June 02, 2021 New York City and Philadelphia are about 1.5 - 2.5 hours away from each other depending on method of transportation, and for anything in New Jersey you would fly into either Philadelphia or one of the NYC airports. So \"flying into New Jersey\" really isn\\'t a thing (Newark Airport is in NJ, yes, but it is still included as a \"NYC\" airport in any search).\\nSo visiting NJ (anywhere in the state) would naturally fall in the middle. That\\'s assuming you mean \"New York City\" by \"New York\" Hi Jackietty,\\nI closed this topic since it is a duplicate of the one you posted here:\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13566634-New_York_New_Jersey_and_Philadelphia-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nYou and other members may continue the discussion on the other thread.\\nThanks for being part of our community!\\nVeynard\\nTripadvisor Community Team I am wondering we will be visiting the oculus while we visit the 9/11 area. I was wondering from inside of the oculus can you get to the 2 or 3 train heading towards Brooklyn without going back outside? No. The 2-3 doesn\\'t stop at the Oculus (the stop is WTC/Cortlandt St) The 1 train does, which is the local. You would need to walk to the Fulton St stop to get to the 2-3, which is a few blocks east.\\nWhere in Brooklyn? There may be other trains that will take you to where you are going. Or you can take the 1 train one stop uptown to Chambers st (or walk there) and then take a 2-3 downtown/Brooklyn.\\nHere is the 1 train stop/route. https://new.mta.info/maps/subway-line-maps/1-line Risa, isn’t there an underground connection between the WTC PATH/oculus and the Fulton Transit Center? I thought there was, but this question is making me realize I don’t know for sure. I do know I no longer need to trudge from the R to the PATH on surface streets.\\nAgree with the advice that there may be other trains that would also work.\\nEdited: 2:17 pm, June 02, 2021 The connection underground to some of the trains is fairly straightforward. But the connection to the 2-3 involves going up and down several flights of stairs, and cutting across different platforms, it’s not direct - It’s a nightmare. I’ve done it a few times and stopped trying. It’s easier to go outside and come back in. Although it’s doable, I wouldn’t recommend it. Taking the 1 one stop up and then coming back down on the 2 is probably the best. I think it is also possible to go underground to the 2-3 at chambers, actually, but it’s long walk underground and not that pleasant (a little more direct though) - I did it once last year during a rainstorm in Covid. Yuck. Unless it’s raining, going outside and back in is a nicer walk.\\nEven changing from the A to the 2-3 is unpleasant and involves a lot of up and down. All of that work on a transit hub...and the connections really don’t work well.\\nEdited: 2:27 pm, June 02, 2021 I am pretty sure you can get to the R underground also, on the north east side of the oculus. Yes, the R is very doable - even with luggage, which I usually have for that particular connection...though they did an excellent job making the escalators and elevators unintuitive. (And now that you mention it, I think I did have occasion to catch the 2/3 there once, and it was every bit as nightmarish as you describe.)\\nI’m assuming the OP was asking because of mobility issues, so the info on stairs is really important. There is an elevator somewhere that kind of leads to the 2-3 at Fulton street but damned if I would be able to explain how to get to it from the Oculus. Instead, you have to go up and down the bad kind of platform steps.\\nI’m all for infrastructure projects that facilitate transfers. But the amount of money spent on Fulton Center, when the internal transfers are so cumbersome and inaccessible for many, is obscene. Yes you can!\\nThere is a passageway that runs along the E tracks from WTC to Chambers Street. You do NOT need to pay a fare to use it. At Chambers Street, you can get the 2 or 3.\\nDetailed directions: Go into the E train station from the oculus. I think it’s pretty well marked; it’s up the escalator next to the Apple Store, turn right at Starbucks and go through the big doors at the station. (There’s also an elevator at the end of the hallway next to the Apple Store, on the right.)\\nSTOP. DO NOT USE THE TURNSTILE TO ACTUALLY GET ON THE E TRAIN. Turn left and follow the hallway. It zigs and zags a bit and there’s an uphill ramp but there are no stairs except to go down to the track or exit to the street at Chambers. I have walked many miles in this passageway for exercise and to get to restaurants near Chambers Street during rotten weather. Not always pleasant but doable.\\nIf you are trying to transfer from a southbound E train to the 2/3 without paying another fare, it’s a different story (maybe that’s what Risa was trying to do?). I think you can walk backwards along the E train platform to get to the Chambers Street station but I can’t remember the details on that one.\\nYou can transfer from the E train to the R and vice-versa but it’s not obvious: from the E train there’s a passageway from the front of the train on the left to the R, and from the R it connects at the back of the train.\\nYou can get to A, C, E, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, J, Z, R, and W trains from the oculus without going outside. It’s one of the miracles of post-9/11 reconstruction, when the Fulton Transit Hub was connected to the Trade Center. When everything first re-opened there was a period when the signage was awful, but they’ve improved it over the years and should be easy to find things.\\nBTW there’s also an E train entrance from the balcony at the far east end of the oculus but that’s been closed since Covid and requires a lot of steps. If the weather is nice, I would walk north along Church Street, and enter the Park Place station for the 2 and 3 at the corner of Church and Park Place. It\\'s a quicker walk than getting to the 2 and 3 entrances (either above ground or underground through the Fulton Street subway hub or through the passageway through the Occulus to Fulton Street subway station),.\\nFor me, who has some mobility issues this would be easier and quicker. Otherwise, the option of taking the 1 train from WTC and make a switch at Chambers street as described would be my pick too. Risa, I agree that the Fulton Street Hub is obscene. When it opened there was a big fuss about how the skylight was making everything so wonderful and light-filled, but everything inside is dark gray and it just eats up any light that gets in. I think it’s because it seems so dark that it has become a derelict hangout, and I have seen more disgusting things in there (I go through there on my bad-weather indoor exercise walks) than I have in all my other years in NYC.\\nAlso agree that the connectivity within that hub is very confusing: it took many many tries to ever figure out how to get to the uptown J train, which is hidden behind a staircase and I’ve only ever needed maybe three times in my life. But connecting that many trains from different lines was a miracle given that they had to tunnel under Dey Street and it took years. Too late to edit #7 that you can also get the 2/3 at Fulton but I’m not sure which would be closer or less confusing. Hello, I’m really overwhelmed with navigating the hotel situation. Currently, I’m looking at 2: Shelburne Affinia and the Evelyn. The Evelyn would be around $200 more so not a deal breaker. I’m looking at 4 nights in June. I’ve booked the Affinia and with their ‘resort fee’ I’m looking at $1100 for 4 nights - a suite with 3 beds. With the Evelyn, I’m looking at $1350 for 4 nights for a king and a sofa bed. There are 3 of us traveling - mom and 2 teenagers.. both hotels have good reviews, but the Evelyn has many reviews from people who’ve only reviewed once. Any advice? Thanks in advance! I think 3 beds is preferable to a king and sofabed and less expensive. The Affinia Shoeburne is an older building but was relatively recently updated and a has a lovely roof deck (although small) with great views. I\\'d go for the Shelburne based on what you describe. Thank you! What about the area? It seems NoMad would be more accessible to sites and restaurants than Murray Hill? I just checked and the Affinia is $600 more than when I booked it (I booked a 2 bed/sofa bed apartment) so it looks like I’m getting a good deal. I’m worried about the location being too quiet for traveling with a 15 and 17 year old? The 2 hotels are a 15 min. walk from each other. While there may be more interesting dining in the immediate area of the Evelyn, the Shelburne is very close to Grand Central with subways to get you wherever you want to go and nice weather will make walking very pleasant. Murray Hill also has a lot of young people living in the area and has gotten better for food. The extra space and extra bed for less money seems a good bet to me.\\nEdited: 2:50 pm, March 16, 2021 I stayed at the Shelburne in 2019. They were just wrapping up renovations and it was great.\\nI like the location. It is pretty residential so you get a glimps of how “real New Yorkers” live ... walking their dogs, taking kids to school and so on.\\nBUT at the same time you are close to restaurants, grocery stores, and other shops. And it is a short walk to Grand Central where you have access to several subway lines and the subway shuttle to Times Square which brings you to many more subway lines.\\nIt is a short walk to the ESB and walkable to Times Square.\\nI know nothing about the Evelyn or its location\\nEdited: 9:48 am, March 17, 2021 Thank you! I did Google map the two hotels and though they are quite close, the Evelyn looked to have more character. But that could be slick advertising? If anyone knows Hotel Estherea in Amsterdam - that’s the type of place I’m looking for. Right now I’m leaning towards Affinia but their $40/night ‘resort’ fee is a joke Also, not that this matters, but I lived on the upper east side (92nd and 3rd) and Hell’s Kitchen (47th and 8th) so I don’t need to see New Yorkers day to day life - thinking about the kids here and what they would enjoy - thanks!! I’d vote for the cheaper option with three beds rather than a sofa bed. As long as you are near a subway station you can easily get to busier areas of the city. Thanks - just more concerned with the kids not being in a boring area in a hotel with no character I\\'ve had a look at the Estherea website (beautiful) and the Evelyn certainly comes closer to that. The NoMad hotel and the Greenwich hotel are a bit like the Estherea but will be much more expensive. The Ludlow on the lower east side has a 2 bedroom suite (they call it a double) with a king bed and queen bed that would be fun for teens. Scroll down here.\\nhttps://www.designhotels.com/hotels/usa/new-york-city/the-ludlow-hotel/rooms/ Do not get hung up on the resort fee. You said that even after adding the resort fee the Affinia is less.\\nDid you know that a room that is $250 per night and has a $40 resort fee actually costs LESS than a room that is $290 per night with no resort fee?\\nThis is because the room tax is much higher than tax on a resort fee. So you pay more tax on the $290 room than on the $250+$40 room.\\nIf you don’t want to stay in Murray Hill, that is your choice but do not let the resort fee be the deciding factor. I am booked at the Hilton Midtown for the week of Thanksgiving. I have read that they block off the front of the building for guests only to see the Macy\\'s Thanksgiving parade. Does anyone know if this is true? Do you have to buy a special ticket for this viewing or is it for all guests staying at the Hilton Midtown? I have tried calling the hotel but no one answers and I believe they are closed right now. Thanks for any insight. The Hilton is a narrow tower with rooms facing 53rd and 54th sts. It is doubtful much can be seen from them. There are event spaces on the lower floors with windows facing 6th Ave. I do not know what arrangement is made for them or whether these spaces are rented to groups for parade parties.\\nEdited: 5:04 pm, May 22, 2021 Anyone else have insight on this? Go to the hotel’s Trip Advisor page and scroll down to the reviews. Type “parade” in the “Search reviews” box and click on the magnifying glass. Many people have mentioned the parade in the reviews. On my upcoming visit to NYC I am taking my 70+ year old sister for a visit. She has visited NYC one other time and that was with her mom in the early to mid 50\\'s so NYC has changed a bit since ll suwas last there. Ive been to NYC probably 9-10 times over the past 12 years visiting with a college buddy. This will probably be her only visit and probably my last as mobility is becoming an issue. So I was wondering on our 3 night stay ( our hotel is near MSG) I would like to take my sister to a \"unique\" dinning experience. What someone views as \"Unique\" I will leave up to you.\\nThere would be two of us. I would prefer not a place that does not requires fancy dress clothes as we won\\'t have any. But I am looking for suggestions that would be unique and can be gotten to via the subway system . As for budget I would like to keep it at around $100 or below per person if possible. Neither of us are into spicy food so that option is off the table also. All sugestions would be great... There is a wide variety of cuisines available in NYC. You mention you don\\'t like spicy food but if there is a type of food you really enjoy or a cuisine you always wanted to try it may help people make recommendations. Will you have alcohol drinks? Drinks with alcohol in them can drive up the bill quite fast, so it would help for people to know if you will have those or not to factor that in with the pricing. You can have a nice dining experience for $30/person (plus alcohol) or for $100/person or $300/person and up.\\nYou need to tell us what Unique means to you. Type of food? View? Singing servers? Costumed waitstaff? Unique could be location or setup of place your eating or such. There will be no alcohol involved as neither of us drink. I consider unique like Ellen\\'s Stardust I think its called or a restaurant with an outstanding theme or one with an incredible view. I\\'ve seen a video on a food court over in brooklyn that is supposed to have some very unique dinning offerings even though it\\'s a \"food court\" type set up. I am open to suggestions... I look for food I cannot get at home.\\nFor me that includes a Jewish Style Deli like Satge’s or Katz’s but I am beginning to dislike the tourist trap that Katz’s has become and I prefer table service. I am not the Foodie, but Queens is the Foodie heaven, Lots of unique places there and a lot cheaper than $100 a person (Even if you take a taxi each way) Having dinner with a view is always unique to any city.\\nSomething like Manhatta would have been perfect, they are currently temporarily closed due to the pandemic but if your trip is later in the year it should be open: https://www.manhattarestaurant.com/\\nOtherwise, there are other restaurants with views if you\\'d like more suggestions. Have you been to Chelsea market? Eataly? Nom Wah Tea Parlor? The food place in Brooklyn you\\'re thinking of might have been the Time Out Market.\\nhttps://www.timeoutmarket.com/newyork/ Maybe the Russian Tea Room a bit more on pricey side but doable.\\nEdited: 5:16 pm, June 01, 2021 Gaonnuri is a Korean barbecue restaurant with midtown views - it\\'s on the 39th floor. They have tables with a grill built into the center; the meat is cooked right in front of you.\\nAlso close to Madison Square Garden.\\nhttps://www.gaonnurinyc.com/ On our upcoming visit we are considering a evening dinner in Harlem. We are looking at as our rap of the day type dinner. We will have taken the Roosevelt tram, a water taxi down to the Staten Island ferry and a trip on it then a stop at the WTC to see the fountains before heading up to Harlem for dinner. My plan is to take the subway from the WTC area up to Harlem but are still looking at which place to eat at. My question is about how long of a ride is up from the WTC area up to Harlem. We will be looking at doing this on a tuesday in late june We would then head back to hotel after which is down near MSG. Have you looked into specific restaurants in the area already or would you like some recommendations? Depending on where you want to dine, different subway stations might be used or closest - this giving slightly different travel times. I\\'d say roughly 30 min or so - give or take depending on exactly where you are going.\\nEdited: 1:10 pm, June 01, 2021 Depends on where you are going in harlem. With an express train I would say approx 35-40 minutes with variations depending on where you are going etc. If you are going to be there at night you might want to look into taking an uber back to the hotel. You are practically going from one end of Manhattan to the other. Is your hotel in the middle and are you stopping there before dinner? Otherwise, this may not be the most strategic day to have a Harlem dinner on hour trip as that’s a long subway ride.\\nAre you looking for ethnic food of some type? Do you have a specific budget? The Red Rooster is always highly rated. https://www.redroosterharlem.com/#red-rooster-harlem Right now I am leaning towards Amy Ruths. They have a nice menu, resonable prices and are located very close to the 2/3 station. I looked at Red Rooster and while I have heard very good things on it and it\\'s head guy the menu is on the upper end of the scale and is a little farther from the subway. My hope is to head up to the resturant sometime between say 5:30-6:30 pm on a tuesday I find the transportation app Citymapper extremely useful for planning. I agree with Risa L.\\nTo add: - I would say if you are going to visit Harlem make a it a \"full\" trip. See the sights that Harlem has to offer. Maybe, take in a show at the Apollo as well.\\nPersonally, Red Rooster has never failed me. For a restaurant in Harlem I suggest eating at a venue that offers what you may not find in any other part of Manhattan.\\nThe Infutation has a good list of places to try (double check to see if they are currently open) -\\nhttps://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/where-to-eat-in-harlem \"and is a little farther from the subway\" You can literally see Red Rooster when you come out of the subway. The entrance is on the same block as one of the subway exits. I am going to echo there is no reason to go to Harlem or any other neighborhood really far from your hotel unless you have a specific reason to do so (Like you know the owner , or dietary restrictions) 5:30-6:30 is rush hour. The subways will be packed.\\nGoogle maps also gives subway directions and time to travel. You can even pick the day of week and time of day you want to travel.\\nI recently found this blog on Harlem that might be of interest. Has lots of restaurants listed.\\nhttps://www.thecuriousuptowner.com/about I think you should acquaint yourselves with our subway system https://new.mta.info/maps\\nCould you do this? Yes\\nWhether you want to do this is another matter. Is it the only opportunity in your itinerary?\\nAs mentioned above Harlem is a worthwhile place to explore Hi All Tripadvisor Readers and Destination Experts,\\nI’m coming into GCT to get to JFK and always previously took the NYC Airporter shuttle bus (Golden Touch)\\nNow I see that this service has been suspended with no mention of reopening date.\\nAre there other reliable bus shuttle services from GCT?\\nI prefer that to the subway of AirTrain.\\nIf anyone knows of any shuttle services, buses or shared rides, from GCT, please post! I can’t find anything. Oh, I did see one bus shuttle but the reviews were absolutely awful.\\nThere must be something.....?? 9PSband return from JFK to GCT, please)\\nThank you in advance for your advice,\\nEdited: 2:19 pm, June 01, 2021 I don\\'t mess with shuttles in NYC because there are too many potential delays. If you really are against using the subways to do the trip then the options I can think of are taxi/car service or heading cross town to penn station to take the LIRR. You can take the shuttle from grand central to times square and just walk down to penn station. Takes about 15 minutes total. Honestly though until they start running the LIRR trains into grand central I would be opting for the subway unless you have luggage issues in which case I would rely on a cab/car service. \"Due to ongoing health concerns regarding COVID-19, please be advised that all shared ride services have been suspended at JFK, LGA, and EWR airports until further notice.\"\\nhttps://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/taxi-car-and-van-service Hi Red259,\\nThank you for responding so quickly.\\nSo you think the shuttles are too iffy for me to rely on? I’ve only ever taken the NYC Airporter so I don’t have any knowledge of other reliable shuttle services.\\nIs there a fixed price for cabs from GCT? And the tip is additional?\\nThank you! Yes there is a flat fare around $52 for taxi to the airport. That does not include tip/tolls and there is a couple of dollar surcharge if leaving during a non-holiday week night between 4-8pm. You might get a better deal booking a car service like Carmel or Dial 7. Doesn\\'t hurt to check prices in advance. Thanks again Red259! I will check out both those car services that you mentioned for prices. Have you investigated shuttles or car services from Ct. if that,s where you’re starting? Right now, that might be the better option. I live near GCT and those buses and haven\\'t seen any activity lately. Actually, I was going up 3d Av on a city bus the other day and when we passed the street where they stop I looked up both 40th and 41st as I couldn\\'t remember which street it was and I saw no buses either for JFK/LGA or EWR. Note that even before pandemic JFK bus was operating on reduced schedule, probably due to slumping demand.\\nIf you do take taxi, expect to pay about $75 with toll, tip, surcharges, etc. I don\\'t know where you come out of GCT -- Lex side might be best for taxi to JFK so you can go straight down to midtown tunnel -- but if you come out on 42d st and there is one of those taxi lines nr corner of Vanderbilt, you could always shout something like \"anyone want to share taxi to JFK?\" You never know. I have done that a couple times at airports and had takers (have also had people look at me like I had a couple loose screws).\\nOn car services like Dial, etc, there is sometimes coupon for $5 or so discount for airport trips (though not at peak airport travel times). Look on their websites. Try to plan ahead. There have been reports of people paying $250 for last minute Ubers to JFK. There is apparently a shortage of drivers. Yellow cabs can also sometimes be hard to come by, also due to fewer drivers. And I agree with nywhiz that, given the expense and time you may encounter coming through GCT, it might make sense to at least look into shuttles or other services from CT. You could also look into taking train from Danbury to Norwalk or wherever you normally change for train to GCT, then shuttle or car service from there to JFK. Hi Grandrue nywhiz,\\nThank you both for answering and offering suggestions.\\nI did first research car services from CT and prices are so high!\\nThat’s why it seemed to be the better option to try for something from GCT.\\nI take the Harlem line Metro North train so it doesn’t go to Norwalk as the New Haven line would.\\nA lot of folks relied on that NYC Airporter so I’m surprised that it hasn’t restarted or that some other service hasn’t yet replaced it.\\nAny other thoughts? There’s not even a number to call to ask when that bus will be resuming, I tried and it was out of service, which is not a good sign at all. Best places to stay with a conjoining room? Preferably not over 650 a night. Seems impossible to find with the “pretty” or “elegant” hotels. If you\\'re talking 650 a night total for 2 adjoining rooms in an elegant hotel, yes, it may not be easy, but not necessarily impossible. Have you used any of the filtering features on 3d party booking sites, like hotels.com, etc? You could use those to try to identify hotels that have these rooms, then contact the hotels directly. I don\\'t know if you realize hotel prices in NYC fluctuate greatly by date. You may be looking at pricey dates and $650 for 2 rooms in a nice hotel is not considered a lot here, especially when you add taxes and resort fees. it would help to know how many you are, and who is traveling (kids? 2 couples etc.). What do you consider a “pretty” hotel?\\nThere are hotels with 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suites that might work just as well as adjoining rooms. Please be specific with your dates and price per room and how many beds are needed. If yiu have a neighborhood or area you prefer, let us know.\\nMany times of year this price is doable, but not all Also realize that adjoining rooms are a request- they are typically not guaranteed. So have a Plan B if the rooms are not adjoining or speak to hotel directly about your request. And make sure you’re asking for what you want.\\nConnecting rooms.\\nAdjoining rooms are simply rooms next to each other. Every hotel has them. Unless there’s only one room per floor, which would be a bit unusual. :) We had connecting rooms at the Artezen Hotel. Beautiful, smaller, boutique hotel in a fantastic location right near the 9/11 Memorial and across the street from Fulton Street Subway station with multiple lines. Hi everyone,\\nI have provisionally booked both these hotels for 5 nights next Easter both at excellent value. We are a family of 5, 2 adults, 1 teen and 2 under 10s.\\nThe Gallivant family room has 2 doubles and a retractable set of bunk beds.\\nThe Paramount has 2 double beds only\\nWhich hotel would you recommend I stick with?\\nWe only intend on sleeping in the room but would still like a little space. Also does anyone know if either of these hotels are being used as homeless shelters? I completely understand homeless people being housed in them dont get me wrong but I also want to feel safe.\\nTiA I\\'m not a hotel expert, but the fire laws restrict the number of persons per room and few NYC hotels have room enough for a roll away (so the Paramount may not work at all)\\nI think you should see if the hotel experts can suggest some alternatives\\nThey need to know 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport (EWR?) and 4) hotel budget in US $\\nEdited: 8:28 am, May 29, 2021 How old will the teen be? Because sometimes they will be counted as an adult. He will be 15 but both hotels are aware of this and have already confirmed that the price is per room not per person. 2 rooms would be better but quite costly.\\nEdited: 8:52 am, May 29, 2021 The Paramount doesn\\'t even seem to be accepting bookings for any date, and it doesn\\'t appear you can book their room with 2 doubles for 5 people. Have you spoken with them directly? Yes,\\nThe manager emailed me back and said I could book it for 4 and bring 5 same price. I can only go by the images and although the Paramount seems to be a better standard of hotel. The Gallivant rooms look bigger and each of us will have our own bed. Am I right in thinking they are both near to each other too? The Gallivant room is significantly larger; with 5 people for 5 nights (including trying to wrangle everyone out the door for a 6:00 am flight!), more space would be the deciding factor for me. And yes, they are very close to each other. #5 - Hmm\\nAre you sure you were in contact with the management of the specific hotel - not just someone in a customer service center in another region?\\nDid they confirm the availability of a roll away bed?\\nWhat does your reservation confirmation say? Good question, Kaye. The Paramount\\'s own webpage doesn\\'t appear to say anything about extra beds, but Expedia\\'s listing says \"Rollaway/extra beds are not available\". Yes,\\nI have an email from the manager to say all 5 of us can stay in the room. No mention of an extra bed but 5 of us can stay. My question is on the room sizes which hotel is a better option? @Meme thanks for your reply.I will keep the Gallivant booking as its got the bigger room and everyone will have their own bed. I may book somewhere closer to the airport for our last night but we are heading to Tulum before returning to Ireland so might be better to stay put then constantly moving the kids around. NYC just reported lowest Covid rate since Before Pandemic. No deaths from Covid\\nIts time to come on over now, everything (except Broadway) is pretty much open and it looks like hotel rates are fairly cheap as well.\\nif you are a domestic traveller and on the fence, now is the time to come Lots of funky reporting for the holiday weekend all over the country. I wouldn\\'t trust any 1 day reports for Friday thru Monday. But things ARE much better than they were and getting better all the time! Get vaxxed and come to NYC! Without the international travellers , NYC will be a lot less crowded as well Howard, is it? The reason I ask is because vacation spots (not cities) near my home are busier than ever due to pent up demand from domestic travelers.\\nI wonder if the same will happen in cities. Although it seems that business travel is still down.\\nEdited: 4:07 pm, June 01, 2021 Four adults and a teenager will be in NYC for Broadway shows in late September. We are looking at a two-bedroom apartment in the Radio City Apartments building on 49th Street. The building looks a bit run down, and the square footage is listed as 200 sq. ft., which does not seem reasonable. Reviews on Booking.com are good, though. Does anyone know this building, and have any advice for us? Our other option seems to be an apartment in West Village, on Christopher Street, which seems to be a very new offering. Does anyone have thoughts on either of these? Thank you for any information you may have. I have stayed at Radio City Apartments several times. Great value and no complaints. The 2 br apt is a nice size, definitely larger than 200 sq ft.\\nEdited: 8:39 pm, May 31, 2021 Radio City Apartments is a frequently recommended legal apartment style hotel in a very convenient location\\nYou should consult their website and perhaps consider booking direct http://www.radiocityapartments.com/\\nIf you are looking at apartment rentals (?)\\nBe aware that the majority of AirBnB Style short term apartment rentals are illegal in all of NYC\\nThey are illegal in any residential building with three or more units. The only potentially legal ones are in one or two family houses - which are uncommon in areas that are desirable or convenient for visitors https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/articles/liz-krueger/answers-new-yorkers-concerned-or-confused-about-illegal-hotel-law and https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/about-illegal-short-term-rentals.page\\nThe source of the offer does not matter - the legal classification of the building does. No internet middleman, even otherwise respectable or well known ones (AirBnB, Vrbo, TA, etc), vets listings for compliance with local laws, leaving visitors vulnerable.\\nTo get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport / train station (OR if driving and need parking directions of travel) and 4) hotel budget. There are several legal apartment style hotels if a kitchen is important. Even in NYC 2 bedroom apts are not as small as 200 square feet. I once knew someone who was in grad student housing at Columbia and said their 2 BR apt was 600 sf, and that made me gasp; don\\'t even want to think what 200 would be like. I am also going in September.. 3 on a girls trip and I booked the 420 sq foot room: 2 beds, one sofa bed.\\nI’ve never stayed there though... this will be a first .\\nHoping it’ll be fine. The two bedroom apartments are very good - the hotel’s website has pictures. We stayed in one in 2018 and had booked again for 2020 which was cancelled. Have just booked for March 2022. If you just want a comfortable base in a good location it’s fine - though no restaurant, room service etc.\\nYou should note though that it’s a hotel - not an apartment like you might find on AirBnB - which are mostly illegal in NYC anyway. Good information here. Thank you. I had a basic understanding of the NY laws and that makes me skeptical of the West Village apartment. We are looking forward to our visit! Thanks. I felt sure that size information was wrong, but had to ask. We are booked, and eager for our visit. Thanks. I\\'m curious to know where you saw a listing that the 2 bedroom apt. Was 200sf? In my recollection, there were some 2 bedroom suites with 2 bathrooms although that,s not listed on their website. You might want to call and check that.\\nThe building IS old and the decor is tired but the space, location and price still make it a popular option. NYWhiz. It looks like it is on booking.com\\nThe square footage makes no sense, but they also have a 1bedroom listed at 200 sq feet and another 1 bedroom at 420sq feet\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/2s2r6f4b\\nEdited: 3:49 pm, June 01, 2021 Has anyone ever taken the Panda Bus? I’m looking to travel from NYC to DC in 2 weeks and they show the most convenient for me arrival times (in comparison to all other bus options). I’d like to learn how reliable they are and if they are deemed safe… and overall comfort of travel. Please advise Have you looked at reviews?\\nIs their bus stop location convenient for you?\\nhttps://www.bbb.org/us/ny/new-york/profile/bus-lines/panda-ny-bus-0121-165326\\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/panda-ny-bus-new-york?sort_by=date_desc I have never taken Panda Bus, but so-called Chinatown buses have a rather poor reputation for safety, comfort, and staff. A better choice might be Megabus. Except for those on a tight budget, most would opt for Amtrak for a trip of this length, 3.5 hours. This thread is a year old but mentions several bus options\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k12833433-Bus_from_DC_to_NY-New_York_City_New_York.html Yes - mega bus is my usual option except to be there at the time I need to be would require me leaving at 3am and then waiting which I’m trying to avoid. I looked at literally all usual options and none of them arrive around 9.30-10am in DC. Except this questionable service. That is why I am looking to see if anyone actually uses them and can give me a first hand review. Amtrak has a 6:02 weekday departure that arrives at 9:33. Fares start at $39. Hello again.\\nCurious what is expected after being served breakfast in a hotel where it is included as part of the rate.\\nI heard someone speculate that in some places you\\'d still receive a bill showing the normal price for breakfast, but this would be crossed out, and that you\\'d then be expected to leave a tip based on the original price of breakfast.\\nThis sounds very odd to me, so not sure if true.\\nI have to date never felt compelled to leave a tip for a \\'free\\' service anywhere in the world. I haven\\'t been to the US for decades so no idea how it is there.\\nAny thoughts appreciated.\\nThanks. If it\\'s the usual buffet where you serve yourself, no tip is required. If you\\'re sitting down and being served the meal, a tip would be in order. I agree that if it is a serve yourself breakfast, I wouldn\\'t leave a tip. The only exception to that is if one of the servers gave upi spme fprm of extraordinary service. I just stayed this weekend at a Texas Fairfield (Marriott property) that had the first full buffet style breakfast I’d seen in over a year. I was there for a bike race as were many other hotel guests and the room was busy. There was one lone woman in charge of keeping things stocked, and cleaning up after folks too rude to do it themselves.\\nAs I was leaving I went over and handed her a few bucks and she thanked me. I might have been the only one who did that morning. I felt like it’s the right thing to do. YMMV If someone is keeping the table clean and serving coffee, I leave a couple dollars.\\nIf someone is cooking eggs and omelettes to order and has a tip cup out, I leave a dollar.\\nI take care of the people who take care of me. The breakfast is “free”, not the service. I agree with the others ... if you sit at a table and get served tip the waitress. It’s what we do. Forgotmypword I was thinking the same thing. **The breakfast is “free”, not the service. I agree with the others ... if you sit at a table and get served tip the waitress. It’s what we do.**\\n^\\n+1\\n....or forgo the hotel breakfast and pick up a bagel and OJ at a street vendor. With included buffet breakfasts in the past I usually slip a dollar or two under my plate so that whoever does the clearing gets it. They work hard especially when the hotel is busy.\\nWhen it\\'s a sit down breakfast a few dollars at the end is welcome. Think it depends on circumstances. If you have been waited on, or even if if you haven\\'t but someone in the room looks like they have been working hard, you might want to consider a tip. If there\\'s just a bunch of donuts or muffins on a table and nobody around, I\\'d forget about it. Always err on the side of tipping. It is expensive to live in NYC and every dollar counts.\\nIf you can afford to visit New York you can afford to tip. It is a part of our culture. Is it true that there are no escalators or elevators at Penn Street? If that\\'s the case how do tourists manage when arriving with luggage from the airport? Assuming you mean Pennsylvania station in Manhattan the ease of finding the elevators varies depending on how you are arriving (LIRR or NJT) https://jasongibbs.com/pennstation/ As a person who always arrives via train to NY Penn Station (via NJ Transit), inevitably the closest exit is a set of stairs so I end up lugging my bag. However, as noted in the great link Kaye provided, there are elevators, escalators available. But you may end up feeling like a salmon swimming upstream to find them, as the rest of crowd takes the nearest exit. Which is likely why some people don\\'t realize there are accessible exits as well. Assuming you\\'re arriving by train at Penn Station, you can ask the train conductor to point you in the direction of the nearest elevator or escalator. Does this mean there are no signs?\\nBackground: We have a trip planned next month. Arriving by Amtrak to NY Penn. We would exit NY Penn to reach the hotel. We will have baggage. Thanks for the great replies. Yes we\\'d be arriving from Newark on the NJ Transit. I\\'ll have a look at the attachments and work it out based on that. The number and locations of elevators varies by platform. You might ask the conductor which way is most convenient. You\\'ll take one elevator/escalator to an upper level of the station and then another to the street. Depending on your destination (walking distance, subway or cab line) you may want to exit at street level in a specific direction or some subway connections can be made within the station\\n#6 - If you are arriving by Amtrak you will be passing through the recently opened Moynihan train hall (see the diagram link in #2) While there is signage the distractions of the crowded platform can make navigating somewhat confusing. Amtrak passengers can request a Red Cap (porter) meet them to assist https://www.amtrak.com/amtrak-red-cap-baggage-assistance The service is free but tipping is customary\\nEdited: 9:40 am, May 27, 2021 P.S.#6 - After a second look at the diagram I think some exits from the Amtrak platforms still take you through the Penn station side of the complex.\\nYou may want to choose to go through the Moynihan train hall since it\\'s shiny new https://www.amtrak.com/moynihan-train-hall Thank you, Kaye. That is helpful.\\nAnd yes, the Amtrak ticket says \"NY MOYNIHAN TRAIN HALL AT PENN STATION\". So guess that\\'s the route we\\'ll take. And the Red Cap service may just be useful for a tip (and a lot less hassle). Will consider that. We are coming in for a few days towards the end of June and staying at the SpringHill Suites Times Square (W 36th btw 8th & 9th Ave).\\nI was hoping to get a few recommendations for local restaurants for mainly dinner but maybe some lunches.\\nWe like reasonably priced places, ethnic is good, pizza will always work but don\\'t think I\\'ll be allowed to have pizza at every meal.\\nThanks! The blocks nearby aren\\'t the best for dining in my opinion. At least they weren\\'t when I first visited NYC and stayed in the area but this is quite a long time ago. How far are you willing to walk? If you head a bit further north along 9 avenue (and 10 avenue), you\\'ll find lots of local spots in the Hells Kitchen area.\\nMercato is near, if you like Italian food. It\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve been, but I don\\'t remember them having pizza on their menu. They do have excellent pastas though.\\nSkylight Diner is near if you like typical diner fare. In that area I really like Tavola. Casual Italian.\\nI also noticed there is a Boqueria not too far away. While I\\'ve never eaten at that particular location I like Boqueria a lot - great tapas. It’s not far from the new Hudson Yards mall (well, the newness has worn down a tad). There are a number of restaurants in the mall if you like. You should try Jose Andres’ Mercado for Spanish food (not to be confused w Mercato, an Italian restaurant). I would first check with your hotel and see if they are still housing homeless people. There have been numerous issues with hotels in that area. This article is from a month ago, but it helped another member a while back in making a different hotel decision:\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/04/24/hells-kitchen-fears-summer-of-the-living-dead-as-homeless-multiply/ Yes, agree springerandy. The area is pretty bad. This doesn\\'t answer OP\\'s question but just want to reiterate further investigation into hotel may be called for. Your life may or may not be in danger, but the atmosphere around some of these hotels being used as homeless shelters can be creepy and repulsive. I happened to walk by one today in what I would generally describe as greater Kips Bay. It was once a budget hotel, part of a chain, that I think got decent reviews here. But I could tell before I crossed the street that was no\\nlonger the case. There were groups of people hanging out in front, one or two staggering, and a security guard wearing the blue latex gloves they all seem to wear these days (and that is usually a sure fire giveaway to me). As I got closer I could smell human waste and weed. I got past the hotel as quickly as possible. I live in east midtown and we have similar problems here. Parents no longer allow their children to play in the public park near me. One of the groups or hotels housing these groups has had to hire a \"security\" person in a hi vis orange vest to patrol a couple private parks with public access (like attached to office or apt. buildings) to get the loiterers to throw their beer bottles and drug paraphernalia in the trash and stop fighting and begging. I have seen them having to drag out people who could no longer stand and walk on their own at park closing time. Police are frequently called to these hotels, sometimes multiple times a day, because of fights, drug ODs, etc. It\\'s just a very unpleasant atmosphere.\\nEdited: 3:11 am, May 29, 2021 Ouch! Came here looking for a decent place to grab dinner and a whole new set of issues came to light.\\nThanks for all the info - we\\'ll do a deeper dive.\\nHow about the Renaissance New York Midtown (218 West 35th) or Courtyard New York Manhattan/Chelsea (135 West 30th)? Hello all, taking my wife and I to NYC for our 3rd trip to celebrate a BIG birthday for her from June 14th - 18th. On our previous trips, and in our hometown, we have never got to experience a nice dinner at a jazz restaurant / supper clubs I believe they\\'re called in NYC. I\\'m having a tough time finding an easy way to see which ones may be open for dine-in experiences and am finding the few I\\'ve searched for are still closed. I would like for us to have a nice dinner while enjoying some live smooth jazz music. We are not looking for a dive bar (honestly we don\\'t even drink) or loud concert type venue or atmosphere. I have budgeted around $125 for the dinner, but don\\'t know if that will cut it.\\nDo any of you know if there are such places open? We are staying in Manhattan, but are willing to go to another borough for the experience.\\nSecondly, we are looking at staying either at the Courtyard Central Park (Broadway & 54th) or the Courtyard SoHo on Varick near W. Houston (using some points for Marriott & like these 2 locations best). Which is a more neighborhood-type feel to it, and which would have more close-by restaurants, train stations, etc.? I\\'m wanting to be closer to Central Park, but the wife doesn\\'t really care about seeing CP again. SoHo seems to be a better location, but the CP location seems to be closer to more things to see/do.\\nAny help you could give on your personal preference on which hotel you would use and the jazz supper club sure would be helpful. Thank you again! I like the location of both of those hotels. I\\'ve stayed many times around the corner from the SoHo hotel and I\\'ve also stayed in the CP Courtyard or a neighboring hotel many times. They both have restaurants nearby. I would say the SoHo location is closer to more of a \"neighborhood\" feel though the hotel itself is on a busy street. It is a short walk to the Village, SoHo and Tribeca. There is a subway station for the 1 train a few steps away and several other lines within a few blocks. I don\\'t think you can go wrong with either one.\\nThe only supper club I\\'ve been to isn\\'t really a jazz club - Feinstein\\'s 54 below. They are opening in mid June but it maybe only for shows, meaning you have to buy a show ticket plus food. You must be vaccinated to attend.\\nhttps://54below.com\\nEdited: 10:32 am, May 29, 2021 Two favorites are Birdland and the Blue Note.\\nThe Blue Note\\'s web site says \"grand re-opening June 15 - so just in time...\" But I\\'d get tickets ASAP - as there is a LOT of pent up demand.\\nBirdland\\'s web site still says \"Check back...\" I\\'d keep doing that - as it\\'s a fun place and things are starting to open up more every day...\\nEdited: 10:41 am, May 29, 2021 Also you might look into places at hotels, like Cafe Carlyle or the Kitano hotel, which have jazz ensembles and serve food.\\nEdited: 12:29 pm, May 29, 2021 -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

But, you should call ahead to inquire - https://www.redroosterharlem.com/\\nThere are many other Jazz places in Harlem. Unfortunately, they have not returned to live music as of today (Harlem Nights, Ginny\\'s Supper Club etc.). For jazz clubs there are also Iridium (where I saw legendary Les Paul perform) and also a place called Swing 46 Jazz and Supper Club appears to be open. Not exactly a jazz club, but with the limited options available to you at this time, I would recommend Chez Josephine for a dinner with live music nightly. The restaurant is an homage to the great jazz singer Josephine Baker, created by her son, Jean Claude Baker. It is located on West 42 St. on Theatre Row, and is decorated in an over-the-top 1930\\'s French jazzy style. The food is quite good, and the total experience is wonderful. I have had two memorable evenings there, and I am looking forward to my next visit. dallasbobtex that sounds good. Practically every place that I could think of where I had been isn\\'t around any more, or temporarily closed. And some I can\\'t remember the name.\\nThere\\'s also the Jazz Standard, which I don\\'t think anyone has mentioned yet. For the hotel, the Courtyard Central Park is a nicer newer hotel but the Soho location is more of a neighborhood. The Residence Inn Central Park is in the same building as the Courtyard on higher floors. Both have wonderful views.\\nSadly it wasn\\'t easy to have a nice dinner and hear good jazz at the same time, even before the pandemic. It was easier to separate the 2 experiences. I think Chez Josephine comes closest to what you describe and tends to have music every night. Robert restaurant at the top of the Museum of Art & Design has live music on Saturday nights right now, but it doesn\\'t look like you\\'re here on a weekend.. They also have a lovely view and would be an easy walk from the Courtyard Central Park.\\nhttps://robertnyc.com/#events\\nFine and Rare may be an option but is pricey.\\nhttps://www.fineandrare.nyc/menu/\\nThe bar next Door is not currently open for jazz, but may reopen by mid June. It’s a low key jazz place in Greenwich Village with Italian food.\\nhttps://lalanternacaffe.com/\\nI believe the Jazz Standard is closed.\\nEdited: 11:07 pm, May 29, 2021 Thank you all for your help. I did see Jazz Standard is closed. I called La Lanterna and they have dine in but no live music til prob Sept.\\nWe do NOT have to have live jazz music. We will take any live music basically except any hard rock or so loud that you can\\'t carry on a conversation. Any other suggestions with the live music even if it is not jazz.\\nThanks again. Booked a hotel in Brooklyn with booking.com last week.\\nGot an email from them about a slight change. A new tax starting on 1st June. It\\'s 14.75% and the property may collect it themselves.\\nMy confirmed booking already includes a 14.75% tax.\\nOn webchat booking.com said yes it\\'s a new tax, but when I asked for a link/source, I was told oh you may not need to pay it as it\\'s already included in the rate.\\nIs there a new tax? Which hotel?\\nEdited: 3:42 am, June 01, 2021 Not only is there not a new tax but the city\\'s 5.875% occupancy tax has been suspended for the period June 1 through August 31, 2021 (other hotel taxes remain in effect). Maybe booking.com is just looking to make a little extra for itself. That’s an old tax. Booking.com reps are not local nor always well trained and are encouraged to answer questions quickly, correctly or not. \"Mayor Bill de Blasio has signed an executive order that suspends the city’s 5.875% hotel room occupancy tax for the summer\\nThe occupancy tax will be eliminated for all bookings for three months from June 1 through Aug. 31, 2021. It’s hoped that waiving the tax for the summer season will motivate hotels to lower rates and drive demand for bookings.\"\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/nyc-waives-hotel-tax/\\nSo for travel within those dates you should be paying reduced hotel taxes. Since this is recent policy change the third party booking site is apparently not up to speed on the temporary change Ok, so just got an email saying it was a big mistake and we\\'re going to honour the confirmed price.\\nStrange indeed. You should be paying reduced hotel taxes for visits on the dates mentioned above - even if you booked before the change took place\\nSince you appear to be traveling soon I\\'d clarify that this at the hotel when you check in to make sure you are properly billed We are planning a trip mid October with our 10 yr old son.

The Major construction for the LIRR East Side connection is finished and will open in 2022\\nFor tourists this will allow LIRR to Grand Central which is closer to many hotels than Penn Station is\\nhttps://www.ny1.com/nyc/manhattan/news/2021/05/27/cuomo--all-major-construction-on-east-side-access-project-now-complete In other words, for people coming into Manhattan from JFK, especially those headed to the east side, this will be, hopefully, a vast improvement over what is currently available, as people who take the Air Train from JFK to Jamaica won\\'t have their options limited to the E subway line or an LIRR train to Penn Station on the west side. At least some LIRR trains will stop on the east side at GCT. This is interesting for future trips to JFK from the UES. While before the Q line getting out to JFK was a pain, now the transfer to the E train from the Q isn\\'t bad at all. I would have to walk a few more blocks to catch the 4,5,6 to grand central which is a few stops past where I would make the E connection, so it would be interesting to see how much time I would save by using the subway/LIRR option instead of all subway. The ride out to JFK on subway can be rather long, so I\\'m thinking it could save me like half an hour maybe when all is said and done. According to the MTA website, the project is scheduled to open to the public in December 2022, so at least 18 months from now.\\nhttps://new.mta.info/projects/east-side-access\\nWonder how this will affect train schedules and frequency from Penn Station, as there will be fewer trains headed there. Maybe it’s just random luck in timing, but I can’t remember so many new infrastructure projects coming to fruition in such a short period of time - what, 5-6 years? - in my life. Off the top of my head, Second Ave subway, Kosciusko Bridge, Mario Cuomo bridge, Fulton Center, LGA, Moynihan, so many Hudson River Parks, now this...quite a lot. I think a certain governor has done a pretty good job on infrastructure. Frankly I would likely vote for him again. Haven\\'t they been working on this for over 15 years?\\nOut here in Queens a fair amount of construction related activity could be seen from the N/W train when you looked towards Sunnyside yards #3 Yes, it was my understanding it wasn\\'t opening before end of 2022, but isn\\'t there a gubernatorial election before then and isn\\'t there someone who loves elbowing his way into projects he basically had nothing to do with, and stealing credit from people who were responsible for them, all for a good photo op?\\nPersonally, I will never forgive him for pushing Andy Byford out and replacing him with that awful woman, who is making no progress whatsoever in areas Byford spent a lot of time on. Okay I guess I\\'m happy everyone who doesn\\'t live on Staten Island has better options ahead. Offices have been moving out of Lower Manhattan to Midtown for more than half a century. Increasing service to Grand Central makes sense. However, you have to consider that there are only 4 platforms at this new terminus. Trains have to arrive, discharge passengers, and then load and move out to make room for arriving trains. I am not certain all the old platforms at Grand Central are so much in use and it seems unfortunate they could not simply be used instead of this huge underground project. I am certain there are other considerations such as power voltages, etc. that led to the current plan. The new platforms are really deep underground. ~7 stories IIRC. I\\'ll go look at it sometime out of curiosity but don\\'t see when I\\'d ever need to use it.\\nYears back I remember reading an article about how relocating companies clustered around GCT for the convenience of their Connecticut dwelling executives. Wonder if this will have similar effect Staying in Times square but our flight departs at 6am from Newark. Would booking a hotel for our final night near Newark Airport be the smartest thing to do? Travelling with kids.\\nTIA Depends on how you want to spend your last evening but IMO not worth it (for convenience or economy)\\nI think the Marriott is the only hotel on the airport proper with access to the Airtrain (the airport adjacent hotels will require an airport shuttle bus) https://www.newarkairport.com/at-airport/airport-hotels\\nSince you are a party of 5 and need to leave at a very early hour I\\'d book a car service such as Dial 7 or Carmel. Traffic will be pretty light. You anyway have to wake up easy.\\nIMO you can stay at times square and order a limousine service to EWR. Should not take longer than 35 mins in the morning. I am of the opinion it makes sense to stay near the airport, you neve know when a last minute thing could turn up that delays you Fully agree with the first two posts.\\nThere will be NO traffic at that hour - so, with a pre-booked car service, you really only have to leave your hotel ~20 to 30 minutes earlier than you would from an airport adjacent hotel (assuming you\\'d budget 5 to 10 minutes for travel even from a close-by hotel).\\nI personally don\\'t think that checking out of one hotel and into another is worth saving 20 - 30 minutes in the morning.\\nIf you do decide that you would prefer to be airport adjacent for your last night for personal peace of mind - please note:\\n>> There is an error in the first post. The Airport Marriott is very close - but it is not on the airport monorail - a shuttle is still required.\\n>> If you intend to use an airport adjacent hotel\\'s shuttle (vs. a cab or car service) - confirm where the hotel\\'s shuttle drops you off. If it drops you at the monorail vs. the terminal (as most do), the Airport monorail runs at reduced frequency at that hour - so you\\'ll have to budget more time (killing any real benefit of being near the airport ).\\nGood luck.\\nEdited: 8:47 am, May 29, 2021 #4 - Thanks for correcting my error\\nPersonally I\\'d rather rely on a car service reservation than expect an airport adjacent hotel to have a shuttle bus driver available quickly on an overnight shift\\nIF you decide to do this dining may not be convenient so you may want to have your evening meal in the city before heading towards EWR Agree with Kaye - dining options near the airport hotels are limited.\\nIMHO - just one more reason to stay put your last night. Here\\'s the info on the EWR Airtrain https://www.newarkairport.com/to-from-airport/air-train\\nAs mentioned above, I don\\'t know if there is a late night exception allowing hotel shuttles to drop off directly at the terminals.\\nThe NJT commuter trains you take to connect to the Airtrain go in/out of Penn Station and have schedule gaps late hours\\nThere is an express bus to the Port Authority bus terminal near Times Square - limited hours and not that cheap for a group of 5 https://www.coachusa.com/airport-transportation/newark-airport\\nEdited: 9:57 am, May 29, 2021 Thanks everyone. Ye have been very helpful. We will stay put and book one the car services you mentioned. Would 3 or 4am be a reasonable time to leave the hotel for a 6am flight? When is your trip taking place?\\nThere’s always a chance your flight time can change if you’ve purchased tickets early.\\nFor arrival time, assuming it’s a domestic flight, check to see what time the check-in counter opens. No point in arriving at 4:00 if they aren’t open until 4:30.\\nDitto for the TSA checkpoints. Depends on your risk tolerance\\nI\\'d say 4:00 gives ample time (should have you at EWR at 4:30).\\nI personally would leave at 4:30, but EWR is \"old hat\" for me - and I never check a bag and can count in the TSA-pre line. I would not recommend that you cut it that close. Can anyone recommend someone that would be willing to deliver a blessing ceremony in Central Park on Wednesday 6th April 2022.\\nWe are getting married in Edinburgh, Scotland but want to have a blessing in Central Park, so no marriage certificates etc required. We just want a blessing, with 4 guests in attendance and we will have a photographer there also. Are you required to take a Covid test prior to flying to NYC? If so, how long before the flight? We’re flying from LA. TIA If you are asymptomatic NYS no longer requires testing or quarantine. You must still complete the Traveler Health form https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory\\nYour airline may have requirements - check with them. Thank you! I will make sure to do this. Hi- I recently flew JFK-DEN round trip. Masks required but no health form was asked for or required. Plane was packed. Safe travels Travel health form remains required whether it is asked for or not. Can be filled out online or put in the boxes in the terminals. How many people are filling out those forms these days? #5 - People who take personal responsibility for their actions People who follow the rules/ law. My forum friends- we are fully vaccinated and are not ‘rebels’. We take responsibility for our actions. Have you flown lately? Please do not cast aspersions if you have not flown. Our airline did not ask us to fill out anything. Not looking for a fight as I respect and get good advice from the regular posters. ***Have you flown lately? Please do not cast aspersions if you have not flown. Our airline did not ask us to fill out anything.***\\nMaybe #6 and #7 have not flown in some time, I don\\'t know. All I know is that I\\'ve flown many times in the past year and I\\'ve seen so many people get off planes, get their bags, and leave the airport. And as mentioned above, the airlines never mentioned a word. @8 Sorry for the confusion the responses were not being directed to you, other than to the extent that it was being pointed out that they are still required. Airlines weren\\'t the ones collecting the forms to begin with as they were collected in the terminal. The responses in 6,7 were in response to another poster and not to suggest that you were intentionally flaunting the system as its clear you believed the airline was going to ask for them if they were still required. We will be heading south from Portland, Maine to Pennsylvania in September. What is the best route to avoid the NYC traffic. Where in PA?\\nIn general I-84 across the Newburgh bridge but routes west or south from will vary by specific destination I agree with Kaye that final destination will make a difference on advice (PA is a big state).\\nAnd I agree that I84 will likely play a role - but honestly IMHO - for eastern PA destinations - that\\'s as much to do with avoiding I95 through CT as it is about avoiding NYC traffic.\\nMy typical advice is use Google Maps or Waze as they will provide advice based on real-time conditions. And plan your travel so you\\'re not hitting the NY metro area near rush hour.\\nIf I was going on \"averages\" vs. Google Maps/WAZE and if I was heading to Philly for example, I don\\'t think I would go as far out of the way as the Newburgh bridge - I think I\\'d drop down I684 to I287 to the Tappan Zee Bridge to the GSP to the NJ TPKE to I95 into Philly (I think that gives NYC \"wide enough\" berth).\\nIf I was headed for Pittsburgh, however, I would likely continue on I84 across the Newburgh bridge... Going to Philadelphia changes things.\\nTo avoid the city altogether, take the Tapan Zee bridge to the Garden State Parkway to the NJ Turnpike (I95). If going through connecticut maybe look into taking the Merritt Parkway. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

One of the biggest traffic factors can be the time of day, so time your trip to avoid traffic. That won\\'t help if there is an accident or lots of construction but it will certainly improve your chances. Ray had a great recommendation which is to use a gps or service that updates you about traffic conditions etc. I know my gps will reroute me to avoid bad traffic if it is going to save time. It is a high traffic region so at some point you will likely hit traffic no matter what you do. The key is to doing everything you can to reasonably mitigate your delays from traffic. We drive from Portland to the NYC area all the time. There\\'s no reason to be using I-95 at all in Connecticut. I\\'m so glad that this was not my experience on my last two visits to NYC, staying elsewhere.\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/hotel-indigo-les-service-issues/ I once checked into a hotel in Ohio(may have been Columbus) for work. I went up after a long day(1st part in the office in NYC) ready to order some room service and watch TV....and the room was unmade. A pizza box was on the bed. Bathroom was a mess. Etc.\\nI went back down and casually told the agent. I had to wait for another room to be prepared.\\nThey did credit my Starwood account loads of points. On the plus side...no urine or weed smell! He (?) was given a room key to an occupied room.\\nThis isn’t good.\\nBut honestly, I think that’s happened to probably half the people I know who travel often.\\nI’ve been on both ends of that mistake maybe 3-4 times over the years. The author is female - but I\\'d hope men would be uncomfortable too\\n\"I pushed the door open and almost let it close all the way when I saw the inside: The curtains were drawn, the bed unmade and there was a bag with someone’s clothes on the floor. The room was occupied.\\nI let the door shut and reopened it to 1) make sure I had seen correctly and 2) to get a photo. When I reopened the door, the bathroom door was open and the light was on. The occupant had gone inside the room, probably after hearing the door open. I let the door close, knowing how upset I would be if some stranger barged into my room out of nowhere.\"\\n\"But this wasn’t just a cleaning issue: It was a safety breach on top of a cleaning issue.

Once, the cleaning person came a day early. Another time she came on the day I was leaving but I had arranged a late checkout and she came to clean while I was packing. Another time a friend of the owner with a key came by to deliver an item the owner had requested of the friend. All times I got a huge apology from the owner and a discount off my final bill. I agree with Kaye\\'s last sentence. I always attach the chain lock -- both in hotels and in my own apt. This once happened to me at the Rome Airport Hilton, a well-established 4 star hotel on the airport property, only I was the person already in the room. I had just recently arrived on a long flight, was so tired I could barely stand and couldn\\'t even respond the first couple times it happened (don\\'t know if was same person trying to get in or they had given card key to multiple people; at one point I thought I heard people talking so they may even have gone to get someone from the hotel to \"help\"). Finally, on the 3d or 4th attempt I shouted something and they went away. Later, when I was near the front desk I asked what happened and they just very nonchalantly said something like \"oh, there was a mix-up.\" No apology. Always use that chain lock.\\nI think the smells of urine and dope, which I often smell around town (and the dope in my own building) are things people are going to have to get used to in the new New York, though hopefully not at that hotel (yet with its downtown location I think it more likely than not it will continue). Neither one constitutes an offense the police (or hotel) are going to enforce, though one would hope the hotel would make more of an attempt to clean/air things out.\\nEdited: 1:29 pm, May 30, 2021 The two odors are already common enough but in an elevator? Ick ***I think the smells of urine and dope, which I often smell around town (and the dope in my own building) are things people are going to have to get used to in the new New York***\\n***The two odors are already common enough but in an elevator? ***\\nSome quality of life issues should be better enforced. \"Neither one constitutes an offense the police (or hotel) are going to enforce, though one would hope the hotel would make more of an attempt to clean/air things out.\" - I\\'m pretty sure most hotels are going to enforce policies about not urinating in elevators and not smoking in rooms. The fines for smoking in rooms at many properties in non-smoking rooms are quite significant. If smoke gets into the furniture it triggers many complaints from future guests. This sounds more like the management at this particular property are not competent or simply don\\'t care about their guests. \"This has happened to me also 2x in hotels.\" I still remember this happening to me as a kid in NYC where the door to the connected room was left open and the neighbors took over our room and chained our door closed before we could check in. I have a vague recollection of entering a room at some hotel in another country upon checkin and seeing somebody\\'s stuff in the room. I forget where it happened. It was years ago, but unfortunately this is not an uncommon issue not that is an excuse for it though.. While chains are required on NYC apartment doors, they provide little security. We had a case in my building where water was running down to another apartment. The tenant did not respond and the emergency key was obtained by the super from the safe. When the door was opened, the chain was found attached. At that point, the police and an ambulance were called for fear the tenant was ill or worse. The police gave the door one swift kick and broke open the chain. We found the tenant in bed. She had heard us but was afraid to come to the door. Her bathroom hand sprayer had burst causing the leak. She sent an apologetic letter afterwards. Hello Fellow Travelers, my wife and I have frequented NYC in the past. We timed many for the week after the Christmas tree lighting at Rockefeller Plaza. We are returning this year and are considering staying in a different area than in past years(previously mid town east).\\nI have a slight limping issue and am fine walking up to a mile or so. The two locations are The Washington Square Hotel and the Moxy near Union Square. We like both areas but just have never stayed in those areas. Easy access to the subway system is paramount and eating/walking in the area at night.\\nAny opinion as to which might be slightly better. We love markets, parks, and almost every type of food/cuisine. We plan to purchase a week\\'s transit pass. Will cab it from LGA.\\nThank you, 1NCF Either one is a great choice. Union Square has great subway access. Both are great for what you describe. It\\'s not that far between the two. I would pick the one you like best for the price you\\'re going to pay. They\\'re quite different in style. Both areas are terrific for hanging out in the evenings, lots of great restaurants and vibes in general. Areas I always try to pay a visit when in town. I\\'d say it\\'s about 15ish minutes walk in between the two. 20 min tops. Forgot to add, I\\'m having some mobility issues too. Would gladly stay in either location. I think I like the closeness to Washington Square Park for the Washington Square Hotel, but I do like the look o fthe Moxy you mention much better (more to my liking in style when it comes to hotels). If you mean the Moxy in Chelsea, it\\'s a few blocks from Union Square , and the same for the East Village Moxy in the other direction. Which one do you mean? Union Square is great for the subway accessibility. Moxy rooms are small.\\nThe Village is great for the quaintness. Both are good in their own way.\\nAs for the hotels, both are very different. Moxy is very modern, the WSH is traditional and some say a bit worn.\\nI guess it comes down to your tastes and location preferences.\\nOh, amd at Christmas the Village is gorgeous with it\\'s decorations and quantness. I think that\\'s what would sway me to choose the WSH. Check reviews and look at pictures though.\\nEdited: 6:39 pm, May 29, 2021 I appreciate the opinions. Booked the Washington Square Hotel. 1NCF A very good choice as far as location goes. You\\'ll be close to so many good options for food and people watching. This is one of the loveliest areas in Manhattan in my opinion. You might even be around for tree lighting and caroling time in Washington Square. Greetings,\\nWe are looking for a nice restaurant July 30-31 in Manhattan. We were hoping to eat at The Bar at MoMA but we are not sure it will be open, as we have eaten here before. We are looking for something similar for a birthday celebration. Something that is not over the top fine dining, but excellent quality. Not touristy (lol) and appropriate for jackets, and light sundresses. We prefer a menu with both variety, both seafood and steaks. A nice view would be great.\\nThank you Budget?\\nPreferred types of food? Do you mean the bar at The Modern, the restaurant adjacent to MoMA?\\nPersonally, I prioritize good food and atmosphere over views - you can see views before and after dinner. So I apologize that my recommendations aren\\'t necessarily for restaurants with views. You might like the bar areas of Le Bernardin and Gramercy Tavern, which have the benefit of the high quality of the restaurant without the formality of the dining room (like The Modern Bar).\\nI am a big fan of Portale, the food is just excellent. Minetta Tavern might work for you. Kyma and its sister restaurant Elea (even less dressy as its on the Upper West Side) may also satisfy your requirements as they focus on seafood but also have some good meat selections. Raoul\\'s is a classic. French bistro. If Manhatta reopens, that would satisfy your \"view\" requirement too. The Fulton has gorgeous views and great food, with an emphasis on seafood - that\\'s probably your best bet for views and good food.\\nIf these do not meet your requirements, you may want to narrow down food type and budget. The Tao is typically a nice experience. Not super expensive - and nice choice of seafood and meat While I have started to see tourists, I wouldn\\'t say its crowded yet. So nothing appears too touristy yet. So when I\\'ve been dining out, I\\'d say its predominantly locals. Its been wonderful to get back out and eat meals inside a restaurant. No one will ever turn you away for being dressed up.\\nIf you had been referring to the Bar Room at Modern, then you should consider other Danny Meyer\\'s restaurants. The previously mentioned Gramercy Tavern is a favorite of ours. Union Square Cafe is another great choice.\\nWhile I love Le Bernardin, its a seafood centric place and if you aren\\'t into seafood, you may feel constrained by the limited choices. I remember going with a friend who was struggling mightily with then menu. Much of the seafood is raw or \"lightly\" cooked. I love it but others not so much.\\nAlors, vous manquez Paris? Moi aussi. Frenchette does both meat and fish. No views, but it would work for a celebration without breaking the bank. I was at Pastis yesterday. If you didn’t have a Rez, it was an hour and a half wait. There were a LOT of tourists. It was half and half tourists and locals. I saw lines everywhere to get into brunch restaurants.

Good food and nice ambiance. Thank you for responding . Our budget is about $100+ a person before drinks. There are only 2 of us who may have a drink with dinner.\\nWe liked The Bar restaurant adjacent to MoMA because it offered a set menu. We felt that we benefited by having the Michelin Star chef in the adjacent restaurant sharing the kitchen.\\nAs far as selections, one of us loves fish, the other pork or steak. I only added the view request at the end as a last thought.\\nThank’s again Thank you Northern_Traveler for responding. I answered your questions below but not attached to you specifically. Thank you Risa. Grammercy Tavern menu looks like it would be a great choice for us.\\nThanks Again Hi all,\\nWe are *hoping* to come to NY mid-October 2021 for the first time after having our May 2020 visit cancelled due to COVID. We had tickets to see Beetlejuice on Broadway then (totally gutted as this is my favourite film), but sadly this isn\\'t running anymore.\\nCan anyone recommend something else for us to potentially see that may be similar? It doesn\\'t necessarily have to be a musical, and happy with both on and off-broadway size productions. I have been looking online but would like some personal recommendations too.\\nThankyou! We saw Beetlejuice and Hadestown on our trip just before lockdown and highly recommend Hadestown. Should still be the original cast and won Best Musical. Not a comedy though if that\\'s the most important thing.\\nEdited: 9:56 am, May 28, 2021 Thankyou, funnily enough Hadestown was the one I was most interested in from what I\\'d read! It seems a bit dark, which I would quite like. We saw Hadestown shortly after it opened and thought it was the best show we\\'d seen in years. Tickets might be scarce for Oct 2021 as some shows might not open yet (Not all are opening in September)\\nJust take what you can get at this point I\\'ve bought tickets for Six and Come from Away for the first week of Oct, both musicals. Much of the Hadestown cast is reporting that they are returning on their social media, but the whole cast definitely isn\\'t.\\nHave you considered Mrs. Doubtfire as a substitute for Beetlejuice?\\nSix is great, we saw it in Cambridge, but it is very short Unfortunately we are in NY from 14th-21st October and Mrs Doubtfire only returns on the 21st I think. That had crossed my mind, but as someone mentioned, it\\'s a bit slim pickings for that time of the year with Broadway re-opening September! Little Shop of Horrors is coming back, off Broadway, September 21. Hadestown returns Sept. 2. Little Shop is great, and there are going to be lots of Off Broadway options open by then, too So covid permitting we will arrive in December for our first time in New York. We are booked to stay in the redbury Hotel. I have been looking at video after video on things to do. We are here for 5 days. Brookland Bridge, statue of liberty are a must see. I have read that manhattan is a walking friendly area. Is walking from the hotel to brooklyn Bridge and back doable? Or best getting subway ? What are the tips for first timers? In December it\\'s liable to be quite cold, but if the weather is favorable, walking to the Brooklyn Bridge from the Redbury is totally doable, with much of interest to see on the way. Bundle up! Manhattan is very walking friendly. I would still get a metrocard so you could use the subway. The 7-day unlimited fare is a very good bargain, even for your number of days. It can potentially be chilly in December some days, so being able to subway occasionally in between the walking would be my advice. It\\'s about 2,5 miles or so from your hotel to City Hall Park which is close to the Manhattan entrance of Brooklyn Bridge. I prefer walking the bridge from the Brooklyn side back to Manhattan for views of Manhattan while walking. If it were me, I would subway from the hotel to the Brooklyn side and walk the bridge. If you feel up to it, you could always walk back to the hotel later in the day - or subway your way back depending on how you feel. It is about a 1.5 mile walk from the hotel to the Manhattan side of the bridge. Walkable for some folks, but not for all. Another mile or so to cross the bridge I always suggest getting ahold of a guidebook either by purchasing one or taking one out of the library. This gives you access tp many maps & you can best decide what is good for your trip & not someone else\\'s idea.\\nEdited: 10:13 am, May 27, 2021 Absolutely agree with Maxi on two points - absolutely on the metro card, convenience and cost. Put it all on credit card, it’s an awful lot easy and quicker. Some kiosks don’t take larger notes and exact change etc.\\nAlso, subway to Brooklyn and walk back across the bridge. I was thinking of walking to brooklyn and spending some time in dumbo. Then walk back. So crossing both ways.\\nAnother plan was taking the ferry to Brooklyn then walking back.\\nAre the cruises still running in December? This is our FAQ about Must-see\\'s and Must-Do\\'s. Take a look.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g60763-s409/New-York-City:New-York:First.Time.Visitors.html\\nMany people feel that going to a museum or two is a must do, and in December being indoors is more comfortable on really cold days. The big two museums are the American Museum of Natural History and the Met Museum. Both of these are right by Central Park so you could combine one of them with a walk through the park for some fresh air after being indoors. If it has been snowing, the park would look really pretty.\\nThere are many other museums near Central Park, the east side of the park on Fifth Ave is called Museum Mile. The Guggenheim, Neue Galerie, Museum of the City of New York and The Frick Collection are a few others.\\nOn the west side of the park near the AMNH is the New-York Historical Society, another smaller museum which is great.\\nMany people also feel that going to a high observatory is a must-do (i\\'m one), to see the sheer size of the city from a height. The observatories are: Top of the Rock, Empire State Building, One World Observatory, and the newest is the Edge.\\nAnd in December, the festive decorations everywhere are a sight. I would go to Bryant Park to see the big tree and the ice skating and the Winter Village, or team your Central Park walk with the Columbus Circle holiday market (if it\\'s on this year). Across from the markets in the Time Warner Center the decorations are very pretty as well.\\nAnd a walk of the department store windows to see their holiday windows is lovely. This is a kids guide but good adults as well: https://mommypoppins.com/new-york-city-kids/christmashanukkah/holiday-windows-macys-bloomingdales-saks-christmas-windows\\nAnd another: https://www.tripsavvy.com/holiday-windows-at-nyc-department-stores-1612956 \"I was thinking of walking to brooklyn and spending some time in dumbo.\"\\nWhat do you plan on doing in the dumbo? Redbury has a good restaurant, Marta. Try for dinner. And it is close to the 28 th and Park stop on the subway. Also it is an easy walk to the Morgan Museum and Library. Hello! We will be staying in Manhattan near Central Park on the July 4th weekend. Any tips on how to catch the fireworks? Hoping to avoid having to go over to Brooklyn if possible. Family of four, kids aged 5&8. Location has not been announced yet, so hard to make plans at this point. The location of the fireworks has not been announced. You will need to check back later to get some suggestions.\\nIf you want directions, you are going to have to post a starting point. \"Near Central Park\" could be a great number of places. Oh that makes sense. Thank you! Great point! Clearly new to the city. Staying at the JW Marriott Can someone please recommend a good place for Sunday brunch, very near Penn station? Thanks! Assuming you don\\'t want to eat before noon, L\\'Amico is one idea.\\nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/55355762e4b0b0fbe036a21b/t/60882dccc233de41126446aa/1619537356496/Lamico+Spring+Brunch+04.18.21.pdf\\nAyza opens at 11\\nhttps://ayzanyc.com/hours-directions/ Sure.\\nHave been here numerous times.

We are looking at staying at either midtown, Best western plus hospitality or the financial district at Sonder One Platt. Any recomendations on either one or suggestions? We are there from Oct 7-18th.\\nThanks Either a Queen or King bed and hopefully stay under $300/night Thanks Seeing you are staying for that long a kitchen would be useful.\\nAlso take a look at Residence Inn World Trade Center, WeLive Wall Street, Mint at 70 Pine. These are all in the downtown area.\\nResidence inn Central Park and the Affinia hotels (there are three in Manhattan) are further uptown.\\nI haven\\'t looked at their rates but they might suit you. I see that Carnegie Hotel is a solid 4* with good reviews, and offering good prices with free cancelation and breakfast.\\nAlso, during the autumn I always recommend a trip to Cold Springs, NY. You take the Metro North from Grand Central and once you get a bit north of the city (with the autumn colors) it is one of the most beautiful train rides in the US. Cold Springs also has a quaint Main Street with awesome shops and Restaurants.\\nOther tips for visitors with more time would be the UN tour, and the Roosevelt Island tram.\\nHappy planning & Have Fun! Without knowing your plans, or likes and dislikes, it’s hard to give you feedback. Where have you stayed before? Sonder is newer/more modern. We have stayed at the Benjamin, the affinia shelburne, the muse and The New Yorker. We will be exploring the city and surrounding areas and might do a day trip to Troy to visit relatives. I live near the Best Western Hospitality House, often walk by it, and have wondered what kind of place it was. It seems to get decent reviews. Like many of the prewar hotels in this area, it was once a residential hotel, which is likely why they have kitchens. Having stayed in the area you likely have some idea of advantages and disadvantages of the neighborhood. I will just point out that 2 hotels very near the Hospitality House, on Lexington Av -- the Marriott Eastside and the Maxwell (formerly the W) -- have closed for good. Also, the Waldorf Astoria is undergoing a major renovation that will last at least another year or two. So there are a couple of blocks on Lexington that are pretty quiet at night. Lots of threads about Sonder. I would avoid them The Benjamin is not far from the BW Hospitality. BW Hospitality is looking dated but a decent hotel. Affinia 50 is also in that area. Sonder is not a proper hotel but serviced apartments. If you want a place with a kitchen, the Residence Inn has a location in the financial district. We will be driving from Capes Cod towards NYC on Thursday afternoon in late June. We would be spending one night in NYC near the Empire State Building. I would love to avoid driving through NYC and am trying to decide if we should just park our car for approx. 30 hrs and either take a train from CT into the city or take a ferry or train from NJ. What would be the best way to avoid the worse traffic and leave car and our gear safely in the car? Thank you! Where are you going after your night in NYC as that information would be pretty relevant about where to put your car. Fully agree that we need to know where you\\'re going after the city.\\nDriving in the city is really not a big deal. Especially for one night, far easier just to park in a garage and get a hotel nearby. Wherever you park you should plan to have everything out of sight -- either securely in the trunk or take it with you to our hotel room.\\nIf you have a lot of stuff you should first drive to the hotel and drop off the rest of your party and your stuff. If you do this tell the hotel beforehand so someone else can check your group in. Last time I drove into the city it was late afternoon going into rush hour. I wouldn\\'t recommend it to people unfamiliar with the streets or big city driving. Traffic was pretty brutal. Not to mention they would want to leave the city on a Friday afternoon/night in the summer? Not recommended at all as Fridays in the summer can be among the worst driving times. If you are going back to Cape Cod, I would take Amtrak from somewhere in Mass. The traffic through Connecticut will be brutal especially on a Friday Afternoon From your other thread I am under the impression you are Midwestern group of 5, driving your personal vehicle and doing a clockwise circle around New England?\\nIF you will be heading back west after your NYC visit I\\'d look at parking the car somewhere more directly north of the city and taking a Metro North commuter train into Grand Central. Map: https://new.mta.info/node/5351 Look at White Plains or Tarrytown (If you click on the station names on the linked map it will give parking info)\\nThat way you can use the Tappan Zee / Cuomo bridge to cross the Hudson River when you head west towards home Hmm... the map on their \"new\" site isn\\'t clickable like the old one was\\nCheck here for parking info http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/parking.htm P..S. Be aware suburban parking + 5X train tickets probably costs more than one night in a Manhattan garage.\\nHowever it\\'s a reasonable choice if you prefer to avoid driving through the city\\nThe train ride down the Hudson line (Tarrytown) along the river valley is scenic, traveling through Grand Central memorable and likely in walking distance of your ESB adjacent hotel As someone who drives into and out of the city almost every weekend, I think Thursday has become the new Friday. My sense is that with people having flexible work arrangements, if you live out of the City and are coming in to the office part time the peak come to work time is Tuesday to Thursday. If you live in the City but have the out of City weekend place, you leave on Thursday and work remotely on Friday. So that translates to hellacious traffic on Thursday afternoon leaving NY. Fridays in comparison are less bad because many have left or they didn\\'t come in.\\nFor the OP, I would recommend driving into the City and forget about parking outside and taking a train in. The time lost on that isn\\'t worth it. If you are fearful of driving in the City, just come down 95, get off on the Henry Hudson/West side highway and get a hotel on the western side of Manhattan. Just avoid the FDR. That road scares the bejeezus out of a lot of people who aren\\'t used to city driving. Other than you apparently being from somewhere in the midwest we don\\'t have any way of assessing your experience/comfort level with the kind of traffic conditions here\\nIt\\'s possible the earlier portions of your road trip (Boston, etc.) might influence your perspective on driving into Manhattan\\nThis is a decision you should be able to make closer to time of travel\\nThe MN trains do not require reservations (but purchase before boarding to avoid an on-board surcharge)\\nIF you decide to drive in use a traffic app like Waze and look into reserving a spot in a convenient garage (via Spot Hero, Best Parking or Icon parking) Check to see if your SUV is considered \"oversize\" for garage pricing purposes\\nWould driving in save some sightseeing time? Yes. But if you\\'re going going to be white knuckling on the drive you should make the decision you\\'re most comfortable with\\nEdited: 10:28 am, May 26, 2021 Reccomendations for nice restaurant where can dress up, have dinner and drinks afterwards etc and not feel out of place dressed up I\\'m a big fan of Gramercy Tavern - and I think it fits your description.\\nMany other choices - of course - and I\\'m sure others will chime in with their favorites - just offering mine... In any good restaurant, you will see varying degrees of “dressed up”. That is, you should feel comfortable anywhere, pretty much. Maybe The Grill or Lobster Club would work for you? Casa Lever, The Modern, Peasant...I could go on and on, but do you have a budget or particular type of food you like? Or neighborhood? https://www.gaonnurinyc.com/ .\\nWe had drinks in the lounge and then for dinner we had the tastings menu. If you choose this restaurant try to get/request a window seat.\\nEdited: 1:23 pm, May 29, 2021 This is exaxtly what I had in mind thank you! Is The Grill (formerly The Four Seasons) back, Risa? That\\'s a great place, even for lunch. Pool Room is so chic. Website says it’s reopening “soon”. Since OP didn’t say when they were coming, I rolled the dice that it would be open by the time they do lots of places are reopening now. We are not new to NYC but have not stayed at this hotel before. We are coming in June and we wanted a hotel with 2 queens. The property looks nice and we have Marriott status so that swayed us to this location as the rates were very good. I have read a few comments about safety in this area (near Port Authority) and was having second thoughts about my choice. I\\'d appreciate any thoughts and/or advice about the location. I\\'d rather not start my search again because of a needless concern. Thanks in advance. Thats the Hudson Yards, Not the Port Authority, Perfectly fine, The area is ok although last time I was down there there was a ton of construction going on. I guess that doesn\\'t matter so much at night but if you like to sleep in I don\\'t know how noisy it may be. No issue for safety in that location. Thanks for the feedback on this area . . . much appreciate the insights. We\\'ll most likely stick with our selection. It\\'s a bit west for my taste, but there are conveniences to Hudson Yards, the High Line, Hudson River Greenway, etc.\\nAs far as safety, you always need to be aware of your surroundings, etc. Hi! Husband and I spending 10 days in NYC in June. We have been there before and I love both areas. Price is about the same. I am a little scare of the size of Moxy room. Nolita\\'s is bigger. (I am considering cheapest room in both). Then again, quality of sleep is probably deciding factor (mattress, street noise). Anyone who has stayed in one or another and can shed any light on pros or cons of either one. Appreciated. Sorry to add more options but The Evelyn Hotel is in the same price range and a great downtown location (both villages and even a lot midtown is walkable from there) also The The Frederick Hotel, and Carnegie Hotel, are all offering good prices mid June.\\nHappy planning & (most importantly) Have Fun! I love the Moxy EV. Stayed last month and already rebooked again.\\nWe had the room with one queen and then a single. It was a narrow but long rectangular room with queen bed placed horizontally against the far wall, which was a floor to ceiling window overlooking the roof gardens below of the EV. The bed is in a unit with a built-in TV at the foot of the bed. The bathroom is an opaque glass-walled closet in the middle of the room with shower and toilet and the sink was outside in the room. Although small, it wasn’t tight and the shower is enclosed so the toilet doesn’t get wet.\\nYes, the room is small, but it’s well-designed so it doesn’t feel cramped. If you have a lot of luggage, like more than one suitcase plus carry-on bag each, it would be tight to move around. The hotel facilities were closed in April, so I’m looking forward to experiencing the roof deck lounge next time.\\nThe location is just great. Walkable to so many restaurants and lively neighborhoods. Thanks! The problem is that we are staying\\nFor 10 days, have just the queen bed and do have two large suitcases bc we live overseas and I fill one suitcase just with groceries 🤣. So, as\\nMuch as I love the location, not sure if I can make it work for 10 days. Would a place like Residence Inn Downtown / WTC work for you? Larger rooms and kitchenettes. One king bed or two queen beds can be booked in various room types. I\\'m assuming from what you write is that you stock up on products to bring back home, not the other way around?\\nEdited: 11:37 am, May 27, 2021 Also, I love East Village. Great area. You can easily get there from the RI I mentioned, it\\'s an easy subway trip. I am looking at Wyndham Garden Chinatown. Regular room with fridge and coffeemaker and next to Lower East Side and just south of Nolita (Bowery btw Canal and Grand). Love the LES so I think it would be the compromise Location wise, it will put you close to some interesting areas as you mention. Sounds like you may enjoy this. I think Scott S who posts on these boards have stayed there and enjoyed it alot, if I recall correctly. Thanks. Will look for his review Have a look here for pictures and review.\\nhttps://www.oyster.com/new-york-city/hotels/wyndham-garden-chinatown/ My husband, 2 kids (10,13) and myself have planned a multicentre holiday for July 2022. We arrive in New York on 3rd July from Ireland and will spend 2 nights there. We then pick up a rental car and will drive to Washington for 2 nights and then on down to Orlando. Our travel agent suggested a stopover in Charlotte NC for 1 night to break the drive up further. Just wondering if Charlotte is the right place? Or if anyone would have any better suggestions?? Thanks Cherie You might find the Road Trips forum more useful for your question\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowForum-g1-i12567-Road_Trips.html Charlotte is not on the routing from Washington DC to Orlando and coming from Ireland it’s not worth a detour. I will warn you that the route from NYC to Washington DC and beyond that can be unpleasant due to the heavy volume of traffic-rush hours/commuter traffic and summer vacationers. In your case, you’ll also be dealing with an even more increased volume of travelers due to the 4th of July holiday, when many people are driving to holiday destinations, When leaving DC on your way to Orlando get an early morning start.\\nWashington, DC to Orlando is about 850 miles. How long would you want to be driving on the day you leave DC? Agree with both previous replies.\\nKey question for me is: Do you simply want a rest stop? Or do you want a stopover in an interesting location?\\nIf the former, pick any decent hotel along the route - there are many that don\\'t require any detour.\\nIf the latter, I\\'ll apologize to any fans of Charlotte NC, but Charleston SC is a similar detour and IMHO a far more interesting city ( and a bit beyond the halfway point, so you would have less of a drive on your second leg of the trip).\\nNote that in either case, it\\'s a LONG drive, so you might consider flight options if in your budget.\\nGood luck! We\\'re not too fussy how long the drive would be to be honest. I guess a mid way point would be ideal. But a shorter/ longer drive would be fine of there is somewhere we really shouldn\\'t miss!! Ideally we would like to stay somewhere interesting. I\\'ll check out your suggestion. We\\'re aware of the long drive but that\\'s all part of the fun for us. We want to see as much as possible!! Yes, repost on the road trips forum\\nConsider\\n1) Taking an Amtrak train between NYC & DC\\n2) Is there something specific of interest to you in Charlotte? If not, look at Savannah or Charleston instead. (Look at a map to see the route. Has your travel agent ever been/driven here?)\\n3) Consider a more leisurely drive *so you actually get to see something* on the drive. Otherwise consider flying to Orlando. +1 to Savannah as another option.\\nA bit more of a day 1 drive, but less of a detour and also a more interesting city than Charlotte IMHO\\nEdited: 6:57 am, May 28, 2021 Here\\'\\'s a map so you can get a better idea of the route https://goo.gl/maps/WSbxunfQGBVcZt5m7\\nDo you have any experience driving on the \"wrong\" side of the road? NYC to DC by road is very congested and not scenic. The train is time competitive and you do not need a car (or parking expenses) in DC. I\\'m thinking the train is maybe a better option then picking up a car in Washington. My husband will be doing the driving. He has plenty of experience driving on the \"wrong\" side of the road so we should be good Good idea to train to DC. You don’t need a car in nyc or dc, and that drive will stink. I’ve been reading past posts but mostly these were from foreigners, which usually take longer to go through customs.\\nWould you consider a Jetblue flight from the Caribbean arriving into JFK at 4:33pm, then connecting with American for a flight to DCA leaving at 8pm fro. LGA? I have Global Entry/TSA Pre and would have one checked bag to re-check. I’d hire Carmel for the transfer not to have to wait for a yellow cab or Uber.\\nEdited: 8:05 pm, May 27, 2021 Is this on one ticket through their airline partnership?\\nIs there a later AA flight if you miss your connection?\\nWhat is the deadline to check your bag for the onward flight?\\nI\\'d not be at all comfortable with this - especially if on a weekday during rush hour Thanks. No, it looks like I have to buy two separate tickets or call Jetblue. Online it can only be done separately.\\nAA cut off time for domestic luggage is 45 minutes, and yes, it is a weekday. This flight is a 737 of similar size from the Dominican Republic; most people don’t pay for checked bags. In past trips, I was out of the airport and in a cab to Brooklyn where I used to stay in less than one hour after arrival. But my last trip to NYC was in December 2019. Things change and I have no clue how long it could take rush hour to LGA.\\nPS. No later flight to DCA. 8pm the latest in any airline. I was hoping to find a flight from JFK to IAD that same night, but no luck,\\nEdited: 8:58 pm, May 27, 2021 It all depends on your risk tolerance.\\nIf your flight is on time, you should have ample time. But if not, ...\\nI give you a 78.4 % chance of making it ;-).\\nWant to up your odds? Skip the second flight - and book a train from NYP to WAS (double check your specific date - but the trains usually go later than 8:00 - if you need a \"back-up\" - and you can be at the platform within 5 minutes of station arrival (vs. dealing with LGA security lines). May be a later arrival in DC - but I give this route a 97.6% chance of getting you to DC that night. AA and JetBlue are now code sharing. You may be able to get it on one ticket if you call and get someone w half a brain. They may charge you extra for booking by phone. I don’t know if it’s possible. But it’s just a thought. Risa\\'s suggestion might work - IF they will allow (but given a two airport connection that starts with an international leg - that might be tough to get on a single ticket). AND since you said that 8:00 is the latest flight - there\\'s not much they will be able to do for you other than paying for a hotel if you miss the connection. So that only helps if your goal is protecting $s vs. protecting time?\\nIf you want the highest odds of actually getting to DC that night (perhaps after midnight) - consider the train. Thanks! i will call JetBlue tomorrow and see. just found a ticket from JFK-IAD with Delta leaving at 9pm, but it’s a long wait and expensive ticket. Considering though. I had thought to take a train, but it is a long way to Union Station and then a cab to Fairfax, Virginia.\\nAll this mess because tickets in AA cost twice as much on the day (and prior day) I need to be there.\\nIf I may ask, what would be the advantage to get it all in one ticket aside from paying a single checked-baggage fee ? Thanks The reason why one ticket helps is that the airline will usually \"protect\" you on the next available flight if you miss your connection. But, if the next available flight is the next day... On separate tickets if you miss the second flight you\\'re a \"no show\"\\nIF you decide to try this be aware LGA has a flight curfew from midnight to 6 am. I think Terminal B is open 24 hours but don\\'t think any of the dining or shops will be open As someone who lives between the two airports, I would be nervous. You are hitting rush hour on the Expressway that connects the two. Never good, there is now major construction going on. What I would do, is put the trip into Google maps and see how long the trip is.Make sure to do it the same day of the week AND at around the same time (NYC Time)\\nEdited: 6:36 pm, May 28, 2021 Thank you all ! Still looking at possibilities. While it is cheaper the AA flight from LGA, I now found two direct Delta flights from JFK after 9pm. And American dropped its ticket price via Miami by $200. All good news.\\nThank you all for your thoughtful advise. Looks like expending a bit more money will buy me piece of mind. We have tickets to the Mets on Friday, I would say it is about a 25% chance of it being rained out, more likely delayed.\\nFrom the Mets website, regarding rainouts:\\n\"If a regulation game (as defined by Major League Baseball) is not played and the game is rescheduled as a stand-alone game or as part of a split day/night doubleheader, your paid ticket serves as your rain check. Rain checks are valid for admission to the rescheduled game.\\nRain checks are eligible to be exchanged at the Citi Field Ticket Windows or by mailing tickets back to the Mets Ticket Office. Note that a regulation game has been played even if it is suspended after it becomes a regulation game.\"\\nFirst paragraph I understand, if they announce a rescheduled game, my ticket gets me in.\\nIn the second paragraph, does it mean that I can use my ticket as a rain check for another game, I would need to go to the Citi Field window and exchange it, but it gets me in.\\nLawyers and baseball fans encouraged to reply. :-) It does mean that. You can mail it in or go to a ticket window (or an intown ticket office/shop, if they still exist) and swap it for any other game with availability. But if they do play on Friday and the game is an official one (5 innings) then your rain check is worthless\\nI expect they will try very hard to get that game in -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

I was thinking about attending this game to see my Braves play, but just this morning I noticed the weather before seeing this post and now I\\'m thinking I might just wait until the last min on Fri to see how the weather is so I don\\'t run into the same situation of already having a ticket. Not sure I can even get a ticket at the stadium (not knowing seating capacity), but yeah watching a game in rain on wet benches isn\\'t exactly fun, especially if it\\'s only 5 innings.\\nI might opt for Sunday too if they are still playing the Mets, looks like a lot less rain chance on Sun... I\\'m not a lawyer but what you posted says: \"Rain checks are valid for admission to the rescheduled game.\" If that\\'s correct, you\\'d have to go back on the day they play (or finish) that game, not just any day. **If that\\'s correct, you\\'d have to go back on the day they play (or finish) that game, not just any day.**\\nThe way that the Mets worked not pre-covid is that you could exchange the ticket for any game...subject to availability and the official announcement.\\nToday/this season, they are asking ticket holders to wait to hear what the official announcement says....but...it should follow the same process. The weather is not looking good. ***The weather is not looking good.***\\nYeah, looks like cooler than normal and wet for a few days. My friend told me a few weeks ago that he got some tickets for us for Sunday night\\'s game. My first game(huge Mets fan) since pre-COVID. I don\\'t do rainy games for any sport. I already told him that unless something changes in the next 24 hours, I am not going. He agrees. ^^Agreed, a game on a nice sunny day is relaxing. But when it\\'s cold and wet, nah, no way.^^ Hello all. I\\'ll be visiting NYC with my wife in mid June and I was curious about dress codes. I know it\\'s going to be quite hot around this time and my usual go to outfit is chino shorts and a polo with my wife wearing a romper or shorts and a short sleeve top. We plan to go to a few museums like the Met and the MoMA as well as restaurants like Gramercy Tavern, Rezdora, Jeju Noodle Bar, and Marea. Is there a standard dress code for these places? I\\'m unsure if I would be required to dress more formally for anywhere, and what I should expect. Gramercy tavern is like business casual. Wouldn\\'t wear shorts. To visit museums it doesn\\'t really matter but they might crank up the AC, so I would factor in that it could be cold in a museum. A good way to see what people are wearing in certain places is to run Yelp on the location. Then select pictures > inside.\\nMe? I would wear jeans/shirt/loafers or linen pants/shirt/loafers. Something along those lines.\\nFor museums, you can wear just about anything. While there isn\\'t a dress code, dress varies quite a lot by location. Your shorts and a polo are fine for museums and going to Jeju as that\\'s a very casual spot in the west village. If you were having lunch in the tavern room at Gramercy Tavern, maybe ok. If you were in the main dining room, you would feel under dressed. At Marea you would likely feel really out of place and potentially uncomfortable as the crowd there will be significantly better dressed. Just walking into the dining room there will make it clear its not really a shorts type of place. Pretty easy to figure out by thinking what the likely cost of dinner is going to be. Below $50 a person shorts are fine. When you are pushing $200+ a person, no shorts.\\nETA: If you go to Marea, the uni/ricci with lardo is a great starter to have with a coocktail.\\nEdited: 7:53 am, May 26, 2021 Gotcha, thank you for the heads up and I appreciate the suggestion for Marea! I\\'d get a little more dressed up for Marea than the others. You\\'ll see men in coat jackets there and the women more dressed up. It\\'s not formal but a little more refined. I like to use Instagram as a resource too. Check recent posts tagging places you plan to visit, see what people are wearing. Have a great trip, I\\'m in Southern Oklahoma and FINALLY going back in June for (I think) my 17th visit. Feel free to reach out for itinerary suggestions! When was your first trip to the city and what do you like most about it? I\\'d have some kind of jacket or lightweight sweater on you as museums can get cold. I’m going into the city on Sunday to go to Little Island. What restaurants do you recommend near there. More a casual place, moderate for dinner. Could be a salad place or something more interesting. Haven’t been in that area in awhile.\\nThanks Unfortunately Bubby’s closed.\\nChelsea Market is waking distance.\\nCheckout Motel Morris, Cookshop, Sullivan Street Bakery, Pisillo,\\nIf you’re researching on your own, search for Chelsea restaurants. The Frying pan is a casual restaurant/bar on a boat docked on a pier just north of Chelsea Piers and they sometimes have live music. Perry Street is close by and also a nice place for dinner. Tao Downtown, Dos Caminos, Fig & Olive, etc.\\nIt\\'s close to Meatpacking. So you will have a ton of (fancy) options. Plus Chelsea Market Thanks all. Now I’m hoping the weather holds out. The weather on Sunday doesn\\'t look good, mid to upper 50\\'s for a high and rain likely. The clouds moved in and today was cool, the rain is coming. Bring an umbrella. We have two kids with us on the trip, 8 and 6. Having done a lot of walking (museums) on previous days, I’m afraid they would be exhausted on day 3 already. Would it be easier to rent bikes and tour Central Park with kids on bike. Both of they can ride pretty well. I’ve read many posts about walking is the best choice for adults, I wonder if our circumstance is different? For places we have to get off the bike, can we lock and park the bikes or push the bike with us?\\nThank you for any suggestions. To explore the more interesting parts of central park it is much better to do so on foot. The biking takes place along the perimeter of the park where there isn\\'t as much to see. I would walk and just limit the extent of the park you visit - it’s all beautiful, and you don’t need to see it all to appreciate it. I think that *especially* with young kids, you’ll find walking easier than biking. Biking is great if you want to see a lot of the park, parking/locking your bike between stops, or just walking it, as you suggest. But that can be kind of a pain.\\nPlus, because the bike route is one-way with just a couple of east-west roads that cut through, you may find that you need to bike farther than you really want to, defeating the purpose of giving your legs a rest. The park is rather hilly, too. Even if you avoid the steepest hills at the north end of the park, there’s a lot of up-and-down terrain.\\nIt’s a park, so there’s no shortage of places to stop and rest...and your kids may well find it energizing. Maybe it’s just me, but I find walking in a park very different - and less tiring - than walking city sidewalks. (Or on those ultra-hard museum floors.)\\nEdited: 7:17 am, May 27, 2021 Meant to add - if the museums you’ll be visiting on your first two days include the Met and/or the AMNH, why not take advantage of their proximity to the park for a run/play/relax break on those days, too? Then return to favorite sections, and explore new ones, on day 3?\\nI really think that’s the best way to experience the park - casually, as an escape from the rigors of sightseeing - rather than treating it as yet another “attraction” to be seen in one visit. Take a look at the park map to see where the bike-able roads are and the other sights https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations\\nI agree with Linda that if you\\'re doing the AMNH or MET / museum mile a break in the park on your museum days is a good idea. If weather permits get takeout for a picnic. (If you walk a block or so away from the park you\\'ll find a variety of places to pick up food) P.S. Be aware, by law, people under 14 must wear bike helmets https://www.dot.ny.gov/display/programs/bicycle/faq\\nI believe the rental places at the south end of the park can provide helmets for all ages. Don\\'t know if they rent child sized bikes but pretty sure you can rent ones with child seats or tandems if tall enough. You may want to call to confirm https://www.centralparknyc.org/activities/guides/bicycling Walk with lots of stops for playgrounds and climbing big rocks. The walking won\\'t be as exhausting if mixed with play (and ice cream) breaks. Many of the things people want to see in Central Park are south of about 82nd St. (Met and AMNH). Bikes are good for exercise, but not for sightseeing. Riding is limited to roads on the outer perimeter of the park and many things cannot be seen due to trees. The same rule applies to pedicabs and horse carriages. You might check out the map and select items of interest. I might suggest a route from Belvedere Castle south along the west Park Drive with postcard views of the lake. I would then go up the ramp for W. 72nd St. for Strawberry Fields and the Dakota Apartments, then a walk along the southern shore of the lake to Bethesda Fountain..\\nhttps://www.centralparknyc.org/activities \"I really think that’s the best way to experience the park - casually, as an escape from the rigors of sightseeing - rather than treating it as yet another “attraction” to be seen in one visit.\"\\nThis is what has bothered me and this is what I\\'ve been saying ever since I started posting on this forum a few years ago. I lived across the street from Central Park for 22 years. Twenty two years of wandering through the Park ALL OF THE TIME. I didn\\'t know the names of half the so-called attractions (although that\\'s not a boast, my bad). None of my favorited spots are places that are named in guidebooks or on maps. There were no signs until fairly recently pointing you to the \"attractions.\" And I think those signs mostly do a disservice to the experience, they take away the magic of discovery. It was so much more enjoyable to just wander and discover natural or man made beauty, walk along the paths with little or no direction. I am mostly horrified by posts asking which route to take to see the most named spots - you don\\'t experience Central Park by ticking off boxes. It was designed as an oasis in an overcharged urban environment inhabited by Type A people. When you display Type A behavior in your approach to a Central Park visit, you miss the whole point.\\nThat said, I would walk to \"see\" it better. But it\\'s your vacation. If the kids will enjoy it and create better memories because of having a different type of experience, that\\'s EXACTLY what you should do, enjoy it your way. But I wouldn\\'t count on locking up the bikes and having to retrace your steps. I would bike, walk them, bike again, bring a blanket, sit and drink and eat, watch people, look for little critters or look up to see what flies by. Walk walk and walk unless your kids ride their bikes in LA traffic with you. Too many hills and too many bicyclists and oh by the way the Central Park Zoo is a great place for you and the kids to spend an hour or two. \"- if the museums you’ll be visiting on your first two days include the Met and/or the AMNH, why not take advantage of their proximity to the park for a run/play/relax break on those days, too?\"\\n- Agreed. Central park is quite large so if you are already visiting some of the museums that are in or border the park it can make sense to visit that portion of park in proximity to the museum while you are already in the area. It saves time on doubling back on a different day and then on the third day you can focus on a different area of the park. The park can vary quite a bit from location to location. New York Magazine\\'s Curbed tells us:\\nhttps://www.curbed.com/2021/05/nyc-yellow-cabs-taxis-disappearing.html?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Curbed%20-%20May%2027%2C%202021&utm_term=Subscription%20List%20-%20Curbed Interesting that the cars shown in storage still have their advertising screens active. I wonder if the advertisers are still paying for the ads while the cabs are in storage? Regarding the TLC Licensing Office and whether it does or doesn\\'t have a backlog, I think this is the same problem seen with many other federal and local agencies during the pandemic -- whatever the issue is or isn\\'t, they are simply not as responsive as they once were.\\nI have certainly noticed fewer yellow cabs on the streets. I have also noticed a number of closed bank branches and shops. At some point some of the bank branches and shops may return. But I don\\'t know about the cabs.\\nEdited: 5:44 pm, May 27, 2021 The spread of the rideshare apps (Uber and Lyft) began the decline of yellow cab service, and the pandemic delivered the knockout punch. If only one of these had happened, the taxis might have been able to withstand the attack, but the confluence of all at this point in time seems overwhelming. I think that yellow cabs will survive in some sharply reduced form, but the sea of yellow from past years is probably gone forever. A principal reason that the rideshare apps proliferated is that they offered either better service, or lower price, or both. Until the taxicabs respond to those causes, the bleeding will continue. \"The spread of the rideshare apps (Uber and Lyft) began the decline of yellow cab service, and the pandemic delivered the knockout punch\"\\nThis! Also easier to pay with no contact service since Uber and Lyft already have your CC information. Well stated #3 dallasbobtex. There is lots of mention of visiting the MET on people’s itineraries but no mention of the MET Cloisters. Wondering why you locals don’t suggest them as a visit in one’s itineraries? I’m thinking to try and squeeze them into my short time in NYC. Thoughts anyone? Also, Does anyone know if you buy a pass to the MET is it also good for the Cloisters? And, anyone know if possibly the MET might change there hours by mid June? As of now they are only open till about 5:00pm and closed on Tuesday and Wednesday.\\nThanks People do - it just hasn\\'t come up lately\\nPreviously tickets were good for same day admission to both locations but I think the new covid timed tickets have changed that https://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit/met-cloisters\\nIf you have the time you can take the M4 bus between the two https://new.mta.info/map/5391\\nNo idea when they might extend hours The met and the Cloisters are not really near each other, It probably takes close to an hour to get to the Cloisters from the Met (Quickest way is probably walk across the park and take the C to the A)\\nA trip to the Cloisters also requires a trip to Fort Tryon park, a Park with great views of the GW Bridge and the Palisades, its a good 1/2 day or more with all combined -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

If you love medieval art then I\\'ve devote 3/4s of a day to getting there, enjoying the place and heading to your next destination. ***A trip to the Cloisters also requires a trip to Fort Tryon park, a Park with great views of the GW Bridge and the Palisades, its a good 1/2 day or more with all combined***\\nOnly you can decide, but I love the Cloisters. As mentioned above, it\\'s a good 1/2 day. For someone on a 2nd or 3rd trip or even more or someone staying more than a week should defiantly go\\nIt is IMO certainly is one of the top 10 attractions in NYC, Its just the hassle of going there which is why I don\\'t recommend it. I visited a few times pre COVID. Great place to stop and grab a bite/drink and take in the city views upstairs.\\nhttps://www.brooklynpaper.com/dumbos-time-out-market-reopen-restaurants/ yes this is def a good place to stop by if you are in the DUMBO area.

If you can sleep on the flight you will likely be in midtown by 4AM or so. Drop your bags at the hotel and start exploring! A variation of post 1: Hang out at JFK, maybe doze in a quiet corner. Head for the hotel later in the morning, leave your luggage, see the city, and return to the hotel after check-in time starts. Is there no flight later in the day that you can take? No, unfortunately is the only flight... I was wondering to take a cheap hostel in between or something like that, but might not be worth it. Finding someplace else seems like a waste of time and money (even for a cheap place), in my opinion. Head to your original hotel, drop the bags. Go explore, if you don\\'t want to spend the money for an extra night. You\\'ll lose several hours worth of sightseeing or sleep by checking in and out from one place to the other plus traveling in between - I would prefer spending a few extra bucks on an extra night at your original hotel (be sure to notify them of a VERY late arrival though so they\\'ll hold the room) if you know you\\'ll need a few hours of sleep. Find a diff airline?!! The flights were a birthday present from my parents, and it was the only direct flight from my city. So I gotta make with what I have :P “ what would you recommend?”\\nI’d recommend getting a hotel for your arrival night.\\nOtherwise you’re wandering in a sleep-deprived daze for your first day.\\nAnd you’ll be exhausted by check in time and might find yourself crashed by 6:00 at night. And wide awake at 2:00 in the morning... I\\'ll do that: adjust the budget for the extra night of Hotel, get a couple hours of sleep, and wake up with a nice shower.\\nThank you all! Yes, that seems like the best move. Trying to stay up all night and then all through the next day can really diminish a trip. I\\'ve done that in the past and it turns you into a walking zombie. That seems like a good plan. Chances are you\\'ll have a much better full day if you do so.\\nAt least I know, I would like to crash and get some sleep at that hour after a flight. But that says more about me, who no longer can tolerate pulling all nighters - especially not planned ones - anymore. And hereby I dated myself.\\nEdited: 3:13 pm, May 23, 2021 FYI... this bums me out as a solo traveler\\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2021/05/26/new-york-city-tourist-site-vessel-hudson-yards-bans-solo-visitors/7445308002/ Hello! My son and I are going to NYC Friday May 28-Wednesday June 2. We are staying in Midtown East. This is his first trip to the Big Apple and my first one planned by me. We already have tickets for a tour of the 9/11 museum for Saturday and for the American Museum of Natural History on Sunday. I\\'d love to know any recommendations for breakfast places near ANMH for Sunday. Monday and Tuesday are available for whatever, just exploring. One must visit for my son is the Nintendo world store; he loves Nintendo and Pokémon. He really wants to try Filipino food after watching a video on it, so I\\'d appreciate any feedback on good places to go! We have talked about having one of our days be a foodie day; just hope around trying different cuisines. So if anyone has an idea for an itinerary or best location for that, I\\'d appreciate that too! Well, since the weekend is looking like rain, I would have some indoor activities planned. You don\\'t have to restrict yourself to just that, but have a plan.\\nOutside of Nintendo, what does your son like? Interests? Hobbies? Has he suggested anything/where that he would like to go?\\nSome options:\\n-https://www.intrepidmuseum.org\\n-Walk the Brooklyn Bridge and then grab a bite at the Time Out Market\\n-Essex Street Market(more food)\\n-Sneaker shopping at Kith, Extra Butter or Flight Club\\n-Greenwood Cemetery\\n-Little Island(though I doubt you can snag tickets this late)\\n-Times Sq at night\\n-Coney Island on Tuesday\\n-Sunset Park\\'s Chinatown\\n-Grand Central\\n-Sports fan? Pic at Madison Sq Garden\\n-Hang out at Wash Sq Park or Union Sq on Tues.\\nJust a few suggestions. My Nintendo loving kids could spend hours in the store. I started booking hotels close to RC so we could pop back over whenever we had some down time.\\nHit the Chelsea Market on Monday or Tuesday and just graze through there. Stop and eat whatever looks good.\\nBook Top of the Rock. If the NBC Studio Tour is running and has tickets, do that too.\\nEdited: 11:28 am, May 26, 2021 Breakfast before AMNH:\\nSarabeth\\'s has a location less than a ten minute walk from the museum. https://sarabethsrestaurants.com/locations/upper-west-side/menus/\\nViand Cafe - typical diner.\\nUtopia - also a diner. Thank you for those suggestions! My son is 12; loves video games, Pokémon, animals, Legos, movies and food. He also enjoys history and since they just reviewed 9/11 as part of American history he was interested in the museum. >>>He really wants to try Filipino food after watching a video on it, so I\\'d appreciate any feedback on good places to go! <<<\\nI don\\'t eat a ton of Filipino food . . . there are a number of places in the East Village/LES that I\\'ve been wanting to try, but haven\\'t. This article from Eater has some specific recommendations for that and other neighborhoods: https://ny.eater.com/maps/best-filipino-restaurants-nyc\\nIn Brooklyn, I\\'ve eaten at FOB and Purple Yam, both listed in the article, and enjoyed them both, with Purple Yam being less traditional (and also in a neighborhood that, while delightful, is a bit of a hike from Manhattan and probably far from other points of interest). Wherever you go, I\\'d recommend you definitely try sisig, don\\'t stint on the funky shrimp condiment, and save room for halo-halo!\\n>>>We have talked about having one of our days be a foodie day; just hope around trying different cuisines. <<<\\nI\\'m generally a big Brooklyn booster, and you could certainly put together a fine itinerary in Brooklyn . . . take the N to Sunset Park Chinatown (the 8th Av stop), sample various foods there (Chinese, Malaysian, Vietnamese, lots of small restaurants and also markets, bakeries, and street vendors), walk down to the neighborhood\\'s eponymous park, relax and take in the view and digest, then hit Fifth Av for various Mexican and Central and South American foods (tacos, huaraches, tlacoyos, pupusas, tamales, crazy fruit cocktails and mangonadas). And/or continue on to Coney Island and Brighton Beach for some Russian, Georgian and Uzbek flavors.\\nBUT, for maximum variety within a relatively small and accessible area, I would have to give the edge to Queens. Elmhurst, Jackson Heights, Woodside and Corona all have a ton of options from all over the world. Within a short walk from the Roosevelt Av station, you can find (partial list, random and from memory): Tibetan momos from various food trucks and store fronts; spicy bihari kebabs from Kababish; Ecuadorian food from Hornado Ecuatoriano (enormous portions, go easy!); Colombian snacks and cold/sticky/fruity cholados from Miracali; a bunch of taco trucks; Mexican shrimp cocktail and fish or octopus tostadas from Esquina del Camaron Mexicano . . . and on and on.\\nFarther down Broadway, but still walkable, past Elmhurst Hospital, you\\'ll find some excellent Thai restaurants.\\nA bit farther still (but close to the Grand Av-Newtown stop on the E/M/F/R) - Awang Kitchen has fantastic Indonesian food. The menu is dauntingly long, but the people there will help guide you. Does he really want to go to the museum? I have no desire to shield my kids from things but I would just do the memorial (beautiful) and not the museum.\\nDefinitely hit the Lego store at Rockefeller Center too. There\\'s \"the smith\" close to the museum on upper west side.\\nNice bf place. Have fun For a foodie day trying all sorts of food I\\'d look into a food tour. Though at this late date I don\\'t know how you\\'d go reserving them.\\nLook into Free Tours By Foot, they have food tours. You can try all sorts of food, maybe not Filipino, but all sorts and depending which area you choose food will be different. I dont know if they\\'re fully up and running and on which dates but it\\'s worth a look. You just pay for whatever food you choose plus a tip at the end.\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/new-york-tours/food-tours/\\nOr even pick a few food courts and food halls and try different food there. This is a list with a map: https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Trips/84923659/Manhattan%20Food%20Courts%20and%20Halls **I\\'m generally a big Brooklyn booster**\\n100%....as am I!\\nAnother option to pair with a trip to that end of Sunset Park is Industry City:\\nhttps://industrycity.com/visit/eat/\\nConfirm openings and times directly. Also check the events calendar.) Our family is visiting soon, staying near CP and we’d like to taxi or Uber to the Brooklyn side of the bridge and walk into Manhattan. I can’t seem to find a good address to enter for an Uber. Please reply if you have a suggested drop point. Thanks! I would have the cab/Uber drop me at the Brooklyn Borough Hall building on Court/Joralemon.\\nYou will have a short walk towards the entrance to the walkway along Cadman Plaza E. You will pass the Brooklyn War Memorial(photo op) as you see the bridge approach.\\nYou can\\'t miss the entrance as there is a food truck/vendors right outside. Or depending on where you are staying, simply take the train to Borough Hall or Court Street and follow the same walking instructions above. I started a block or so further away, at the Transit Museum, before continuing along the route ter1413 mentioned. Very enjoyable, along with a few bench sits. if you really want to see a nice part of Brooklyn....take the F train to Carroll Street or Bergen St(my stop.) Walk along Smith Street with the traffic...hang a left on Atlantic Ave......hang a right on Court Street and follow the instructions above.\\nYou will be passing Carroll Gardens/Boerum Hill/a bit of downtown Bklyn which includes the municipal area and Brooklyn Heights.\\nReally a nice walk especially if you are coming soon. If you do this on a Saturday, you can sit at the far end of Cadman Plaza park and watch some soccer/football games, locals exercising, kids riding their bikes around the perimeter while sitting on a bench.....prior to the walk.\\nIf on a Sunday, stop at the Brooklyn Flea and check out DUMBO before the walk. Pedestrian walkway for Brooklyn bridge from Brooklyn starts at the intersection of Adams and Tillary Street. If you need an exact street address you can enter 235 Adams Street which is one of the buildings on the corner of the intersection. ^\\nRemember, that\\'s 1 of the 2 entrances and the less \"scenic\" entrance...by far. Usually my family and I stay in \"typical\" hotels. Marriott or Hilton properties. I\\'ve stayed at the Times Square Sheraton, Hilton Garden Inn, Courtyards, Hampton Inn etc. Fine. Clean. Boring. I\\'m bringing 2 teens for a 16th birthday celebration in September. I\\'d like to stay somewhere more \"hip\" (like the mom I aspire to be). We will be getting 2 rooms. Must be very clean. Any suggestions? They want to stay in Times Square. I personally would like to try out SOHO (subway nearby is a must). But, this is the kicker.... I don\\'t want to pay a fortune. The MOXY is a bit more than I want to spend. I\\'d like to stay about $175 a night per room. What say ye? What are your exact dates? Sept 1-5 (over Labor Day weekend....). I was also thinking of the Moxy. pricey and modern.\\nBut you can also check for the Yotel in Hells Kitchen. I say $175/night sounds too low for a hip hotel on a holiday weekend. How many are you in total? Can the 16 year olds share a bed? Yes, the 16 year olds can share a bed if there isn\\'t a room with 2 doubles available. I\\'m going to stay in my own room. I stayed with my son at the citizenM in Manhattan a few years ago. He thought it was really hip and cool. Rooms are tiny, but super modern. May still be more than $175 per night, but that weekend the rates seem to be a little lower. All the rooms have King beds, so your daughter would need to be willing to share a bed.\\nHow about the Arlo Soho? https://www.arlohotels.com/arlo-soho/ Their prices look right for that weekend. And they have a rooftop deck. I was supposed to stay there in June of 2020...\\nEdited: 3:37 pm, May 25, 2021 I\\'ll look at their prices. The beds would be fine. Thanks! And in case I can\\'t find anything else I love, has anyone stayed at the Belvedere? How is it? Clean? The price is right... I have stayed at the Belvedere 3 or 4 times. It is clean and in a nice, quiet location that is not far from theaters. However, it is definitely not “ hip” or “cool” in any way! If this is their birthday, I,d either stay in Times Square (with a caveat) or give them the choice of a hip hotel in another location or a chain in/near Times Square. Most hotels in TS are chains. The area around a Port Authority has had a homeless problem and I would avoid staying there (8th & 42 st.).\\nThe M Social (used to be Novotel)is running a special if you join their frequent guest program (Millenium). It\\'s north of Times Square and has some nice views. See if that works with budget. The W Times Square might appeal to them. I don\\'t see many options at $185. Remember there\\'s tax and many places charge a resort fee. Hi there I am traveling Thursday-Saturday (May27-30th) afternoon with my husband and 15 year old daughter. I already have the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island tickets for Friday Morning. I am looking for suggestions for the following:\\n1-SHOPPING My daughter\\'s only interest is shopping :)\\n2-COOLEST HOTEL (Views, Area, etc.)\\n3-Best Pizza Place My husband is a foodie guy\\n4-Place that are a must see besides the Statue of Liberty\\nEdited: 1:02 pm, May 26, 2021 1. What type of shopping? Any budget restrictions? Chain stores? Dept storers? Boutiques? Flea market type locations? Has she researched any areas/stores that she would like to visit?\\n2. There are hundreds of hotels in NYC in various areas. Are you looking to stay there or just visit?\\n3. Where are you starting from? There are hundreds of places where you can get a good slice/pie in NYC.\\n4. Must see? This is NYC! There are thousands of things to do/see!\\nI think the 3 of you should each come up with a list: must see & would like to see. Start there. What I may want to see/visit may not appeal to the 3 of you. You also have not listed any interests/hobbies that may help guide the responses.\\nWe are looking at a gloomy Memorial Day wknd so maybe look into some indoor attractions. You\\'re arriving tomorrow???\\nTo get hotel advice specify 1) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 2) arrival airport / train station OR if driving and need parking and 3) hotel budget. 1-Shopping: We would like both flee market & also no budget Unique boutiques.\\n2-Hotel: Flying in to JFK, Times Square Area, looking for views and or walkable eating establishments\\n3-Pizza- Your own personal favorite, I can then research from suggestions.\\n4-Must see Tourist attractions or your own personal favorite, I can then research from suggestions\\nTIA This is my First time List , No particular order\\nTimes Square\\nCentral park\\nStaten Island Ferry\\nRoof top skyview (Could be top Rock, Emprie State, Hudson Yards or WTC)\\nThe High Line\\nMuseum of Natural History and/or Met Museum of Art\\nBrooklyn Bridge park (Dumbo)\\nGrand Central\\nRockfeller Center\\nStatue of Liberty/Ellis Island For a 3 day weekend, your list has a lot of stuff that takes lots of time. - Statue of Liberty, Met Museum, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park. Such is the danger of not planning ahead. I\\'m at a loss to give you any other help as you needed to plan this weekend way before the day before. If by Statue of Liberty, you mean you want to set foot on Liberty Island, you\\'re probably too late to get tickets as they sell out incredibly fast. You can view the Statue from the Staten Island Ferry & it\\'s free but there is no narration as the Ferry is not meant as a tourist attraction but transportation for locals. You could do Times Square & Rockefeller Center in one day & also do Top of the Rock at the same time. 1-SHOPPING My daughter\\'s only interest is shopping :)\\n--- SOHO\\n2-COOLEST HOTEL (Views, Area, etc.)\\n--- The coolest views will likely not be in Manhattan. More on the Brooklyn, Williamsburg side.\\nFor example, I like the rooftop of 1 Brooklyn Bridge Hotel. Also the press lounge has a good view.\\nIf you want to stay hip, the standard meatpacking or the gansvoort might be nice.\\n3-Best Pizza Place My husband is a foodie guy\\n--- I like \"prince street pizza\". But coming originally from Europe, I have to say that NY Pizza is overrated.\\n4-Place that are a must see besides the Statue of Liberty\\nWould propose to browse through Tripadvisor\\'s things to see section for that quite broad question For the quintessential NY style slice, try Joe\\'s. Numerous locations, but the Carmine Street location is iconic.\\nTry Neapolitan as well, my favorite, Luzzo\\'s on 1st Avenue in the East Village. Hi all! We booked the Marriott Marquis but the bar and dining options are still closed. Are there any hotels in TS or Midtown with bars or restaurants open? We can walk to places, but the convenience of having a bar or dining onsite would be great. There are so many great food options right outside of TS. Bars also.\\nI get the appeal of eating on site. But if visiting NYC, surely that won\\'t be an option more than once. The sanctuary hotel times square says their rooftop bar and restaurant are open but I would verify that independently. I agree with ter. So many restaurants/bars nearby, I wouldn\\'t care if my hotel had them. My first trip to NYC, the first morning, we had breakfast at the hotel. Discovered so many options after that, we never ate at our hotel again, that trip and the many that followed. The only time we went to a hotel bar, was when we stayed at the Kimberly and visited their rooftop bar.\\nBut: locals question - looks like many bars/restaurants are now open for indoor dining. Any reason why aren\\'t the hotel restaurants/bars open? hotel restaurants and bars are usually more expensive and no better than options 1-2 blocks away. I think that Marriott has used the recent quietness to update some facilities\\nI also don\\'t think their bars/restaurants attract many non-guests except those willing to pay a premium for a revolving bar.\\nI suspect until occupancy rates reach a certain level it may not make economic sense to reopen dining. Also, if there is a hotel restaurant that you do like - you could always travel to eat there one day.\\nMy take is that staying in an area where there are many restaurants within an easy, short walk from the hotel is important to me. If the hotel restaurant is one of them, fine. If not, then fine too since there are many other options to choose from. This, (and closeness to public transport) is key for me when choosing where to stay and what I research when looking for hotels. And then I pick a hotel within my budget in such an area. I personally prefer other areas than the ones you mention for these reasons but there are places to eat in those too. Hells Kitchen has some good restaurants and this is near Times Square, for example. Also:\\nI can understand wanting to have someplace to have dinner near the hotel, after a long day of sightseeing. Some hotels do have restaurants that are very good options. But as long as you know you have a few places that fits your food tastes within a short walk, you\\'ll be fine (imo). Even though I tend to be \\'all over the place\\' when it comes to both sightseeing and dining (food is important to me when traveling) - hence the need for me to be near public transport and preferably many such options - I know that there are some evenings when I want to stay near the hotel for a good meal if the day has been very intense sightseeing wise. Take a look at the Renaissance Midtown. They just re-opened their on-site restaurant Versa. It is a nice setup, with a roof that is open during good weather. We\\'ve stayed there a few times and enjoy having a drink at the open air bar during the summer months. The M Social ( formerly the Novotel) is due to open tomorrow. You might check them. They,re also offering intro specials if you join their frequent guest program.\\nhttps://www.millenniumhotels.com/en/new-york/m-social-hotel-times-square-new-york/ Which are the best car or limo services to use getting from the Newark airport into NYC? Dial 7 and Carmel are both good options. Thank you! I appreciate your help. What and where does one get the best sandwich close to Empire State Building? What kind of sandwich? What do you mean by best? To me the \"best Sammy\" will always be Sammy Davis Jr. We dont call it a Sammy around here, Nor do we call it a Hoagie either sandwich is not a big deal here in the city There’s a branch of the Italian Panini shop Pisillo on 25th street. That may work for you https://www.pisillopanini.com/ ***We dont call it a Sammy around here, Nor do we call it a Hoagie either***\\nThat\\'s right, it\\'s either a sandwich, hero, or sub. Springerandy it could be a panini, or a torta too.\\nBut I agree there\\'s no such thing as a \"sammy\" there.\\nEdited: 4:47 pm, May 24, 2021 At Le Pain Quotidian (like other French restaurants), they\\'re \"tartines\\' (open faced sandwiches.) There is a LPQ at Sixth Ave and 40th St that is open. https://www.lepainquotidien.com/us/en/locations/bryant_park/70-w-40th-st?utm_source=google&utm_medium=business-listing&utm_campaign=&y_source=1_Nzg1ODYwNi03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24uZ29vZ2xlX3dlYnNpdGVfb3ZlcnJpZGU%3D It\\'s like fingernails on a chalkboard to me when someone calls sandwiches that. Sorry, OP! No great recommendations. I kinda agree with #4. Sandwiches are not a big deal in NYC, with the exception of what you get in the jewish delis. They are easy to find and are fine, but over the years I have found them to be somewhat of a disappointment compared to what I can get in new england or compared to the cheese steaks in philly. Hello,\\nI\\'m finalizing my itinerary for an upcoming trip In mid-June and would love any feedback!! Thank you in advance.\\nSunday: arrive at Penn Station at 2:00, walk 30 min. to hotel (The Benjamin or Shelbourne Affinity - can\\'t decide as reviews on both are mixed), check into hotel and then take metro to One World Trade Center (not open the remainder of days I have in NYC). VIP tour at 5 and then dinner in East Village\\nMonday: 10:00 @ 9/11 Museum, afternoon at Met (only open Monday during my visit), and Central Park\\nTuesday: 10-4: walking tour (Little Italy, Chinatown, Chelsea, Wall St., Financial Dist., High Line Park, Greenwich, etc.), afterwards, play it by ear (have reservation for Little Island at 5)\\nWednesday: morning: Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, afternoon/evening: walk across Brooklyn Bridge\\nThursday: pick up rental car in the morning and drive to Boston\\nI didn\\'t list the other sites we\\'ll see \\'along the way\\': ESB, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Chrysler Building, etc.\\nOne major flaw I see is 4 days in a row going to the same area.. One tweak I\\'m considering is moving SOL to the afternoon on Monday - that would mean we won\\'t be able to visit the Met as it\\'s closed on Tuesday and Wednesday. And, that would put Central Park and Brooklyn on the same day (I\\'ve lived in NYC, so I know that\\'s not ideal either)\\nAny advice? And please, weigh in on the hotels if you have an opinion - I\\'m running out of time to make up my mind. One more thing, I\\'m traveling with my 2 daughters - 15 and 17.\\nThanks so much for any help - I really appreciate it! You need tickets for SOL(StatueCruises.com) and Ellis Island. it’s best to go in the morning. Look at what is available and how it fits with your plans before moving stuff around. Since you have a lot of downtown activities planned, have you looked into getting a hotel in the Financial District or possibly Tribeca? That would put you within walking distance of several of the things you plan on doing, and you have lots of subway lines nearby for the rest.\\nETA: If it were me, I would want to visit Statue of Liberty first thing one of the mornings.\\nEdited: 11:11 am, May 25, 2021 Also, two museums in one day is a lot - or it would be for me. You know your stamina best, but I know I tend to get museumed out and wouldn\\'t appreciate the second one if having spent a few hours at the first - no matter which order. And I\\'m a museum-person who likes those. I\\'m with Maxi. Given your itinerary, it makes no sense to stay in midtown, imo. The Residence inn Downtown has suites, if that,s what you want. The 9/11 Museum is pretty upsetting. Doing that first thing in the morning could put a damper on the day. I\\'d give that up before giving up the Met. If that,s not an option, switch and do the Met first and then 9/11.\\nIf, for some reason you have to pick between the 2 hotels you list, the Benjamin is a more upscale hotel but the Shelburne is more recently updated. The Conrad is also a suite hotel in the financial district. Thanks so much - making notes on all your suggestions and will be researching further! It sounds like it\\'s advisable to do SOL in the morning, so I\\'ll stick to that - I\\'m checking tickets daily and all times are available - even if I\\'m looking this week. I don\\'t want to book too early in case something happens (learned that lesson the hard way last summer!). I\\'ll check out the hotels, but I\\'m guessing it will be hard to beat the deals I got when I booked back in January - less than $1,000 for 4 nights and that includes all taxes & resort fees - it won\\'t hurt to check, though! Just checked the Residence Inn downtown and I could get a room for only $200 more/stay - and that\\'s for a studio apartment. Given the above itinerary, would recommend booking it over The Benjamin? Is it lively enough at night for teenagers without having to take the metro? I was thinking that if I stayed in midtown, and started the day downtown, then at least I\\'d finish in an area I know my kids would enjoy walking around (i.e. Times Square, Rockefeller Center, etc) I know they\\'d also enjoy the East Village, but not sure how walkable that is from the Residence Inn. Thoughts? Thanks in advance!! Personally, I would not book my hotel based on what you plan to do. I would book my hotel based on my budget and travel dates.\\nEven with most of your time spend downtown, that would not be my first consideration.\\nMid June is a great time to be in NYC. Unless your daughters absolutely want to see/do those activities, I would try to branch out.\\nIs the walking tour an actual \"tour\" or are you planning to do that on your own? Thanks ter.. I keep going back and forth .. I think I’d prefer midtown - but now I don’t know where - there are so many places in my budget (4 nights for $250-$300 per night which includes all taxes and resort fees) most preferable to me is a bed for each of us. I have Shelborne Affinia apartment booked (2 Q and sofa bed) and I have The Benjamin booked - 1 king/sofa bed/roll away bed.. now I’m looking at other options. Such a tough decision as neither hotel that I’ve booked has stellar recent reviews - thanks again Remember, mid June....you are going to want to be out and about. Yes...a hotel is important and being comfortable is key, but it really is a short trip.\\nYou will probably have a stop at the hotel between daytime activities and evening dinner/activities. As long as it fits your budget and is near a subway/train station(no metro in NYC), you will be fine. For myself, I don\\'t get hung up on resort fees, parking fees etc. I just figure out if the total net cost is within my budget & go from there. Thanks. Yes it’s just frustrating as it’s a huge bait and switch… something looks affordable and then add in a week of $40 fees is crazy! ** I don\\'t get hung up on resort fees, parking fees etc. I just figure out if the total net cost is within my budget & go from there.**\\n+1 Agree with the others. Total cost matters most. $200 room costs more than $150 room + $35 fee. The resort fees are listed before you finalize your booking so not bait and switch. When you see any prices you know that isn\\'t the final price since you have to at least add in the taxes and necessary fees. If you get hung up on avoiding resort fees you could miss some great hotels that fit your budget just fine. I agree its frustrating whatwhat. It makes searching in budget more time consuming. When I see a hotel in my budget with guest number needed before looking further at location, amenities or anything else- I click to see the final price. It’s absolutely necessary to know the taxes and Resort Fees if applicable in selecting a place.\\nSome resort fees are ridiculously high.\\nAfter looking for a while you can make notes of which hotels have the fee.\\nThere are sites that list resort fees and the thread by Littlebiffone is helpful as well. http://www.resortfeechecker.com/ Resort fees in the city? Hey, it\\'s not Punta Cana... Hotels without resort fees sometimes have added charges for WiFi, fitness room, pool, or other amenities. The important thing to do is to see what’s included in your room and what’s not, with/without resort fees. Some hotels include parking, WiFi, continental breakfast etc., the prices are included within the resort fees and you pay for them if you use them or not, with no surprises and no additional costs at check out. I have never seen the show, but read this article recently and the pics are very cool.\\nAs someone who has been going to CI for many years, NO, it does not bring back memories that far back. I do remember my mom first taking us there with our cousins when I was 7, 8 or 9.\\nMy friends and I would then jump the turnstile and ride out there in our early teens. We would ride the Cyclone, the Hell Hole and then play video games and try to win at those games that grabbed these old school foldable Ferrari sunglasses.\\nAs I hit my teenage years, Ci was one of the many spots to head to in the summer(Village, 42nd, etc were some others.) My friends and I would head out there on a Fri/Sat night and just hang out.\\nI later dated a young lady who lived in CI. She worked one of the booths in the summer and I would pick her up and walk her home. Nathan\\'s was our go to when I got off the train and called her and asked her if she and her mom wanted me to pick something up.\\nThe Mermaid Parade was also a great memory. The after parties on the boardwalk, and later, at the Art Walls were the best.\\nRuby\\'s is a home away from home(a few years ago.) Great place to sit on the boardwalk with a cold brew and just take in everything.\\nCI is coming back as is NYC. Great so see these pics!\\nhttps://www.brooklynpaper.com/see-it-marvelous-mrs-maisel-films-in-coney-island/ We are planning to be in NYC end of June for 6 days. We would love recommendations on an itineraries, given current COVID conditions. We are eager to see iconic sights safely and enjoy walking. Any tips on which activities need to be booked early would be appreciated. Also any recommendations on where to stay would also be appreciated. Finally should we be concerned about walking around by ourselves at night? To get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport and 4) hotel budget.\\nRE sights - depends on what you want to see - you\\'ll likely need to pre-book timed tickets for many things\\nRE safety - also depends somewhat on your plans\\nIs this a first visit? There is so much to see & do in NYC that a one size fits all itinerary is not possible. I would suggest getting ahold of a guidebook, make a draft itinerary & post it here so that we can help tweak it. I would suggest since you mentioned iconic sights, that if the Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island are on your must do list that you get tickets ASAP as this is arguably the most popular of sights & tickets go quickly, Buy tickets from Statue Cruises only as they are the official seller of tickets.\\nAs for safety, the best recommendation is that you walk with confidence & know where you are going so that you\\'re not targeted as an easy mark. You\\'re from LA, follow the same rules in NYC as you would follow in LA for safety. Pre-Covid, I didn\\'t think twice about taking a subway at 1 or even 2 in the morning. With less people on the subway, I haven\\'t done it past 10:30/11 - then again, I haven\\'t been out late either, since everything closed early. Otherwise, I haven\\'t changed my habits, I often walk home (alone) from a restaurant dinner at 10, even if it\\'s an hour+ walk (gotta burn those calories!). Since you will be walking so much as a tourist, and don\\'t necessarily know where you\\'re going, I would say take a cab or Uber at night, but otherwise, you\\'re fine. Don\\'t keep your eyes on your phones the whole time, look around and know where you are, and who is around you. Stay aware. The area around Port Authority bus terminal (8th Ave. & 42 st,) has seen a surge in crime. Personally, I would avoid staying in that area, but I never really liked it around there anyway.\\nAnother poster recently mentioned a special intro rate for the M Social hotel. It\\'s post #5 in this thread\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13553027-Hotel_location_advice-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nIf the hotel will be open by the time you visit, you might consider that. Otherwise it would help to know what your taste in hotels is and what specific interests you have apart from “typical tourist attractions,” as well as the budget info etc.\\nIf you plan on going TO the Statue of Liberty, that is best prebooked.\\nStatuecruises.com\\nIf you just want to pass close by, the are lots of cruises. The Classic Harbor Line is a forum favorite with smaller boats, some with drinks and music.\\nSail-nyc.com\\nMany of the museums were requiring reservations. I don\\'t know which still are. Booking an observatory is a good idea, but it,s best to wait until you know the weather. Visit the websites of museums or other sites you want to visit to check current requirements for visits. This past week, we booked MOMA and Guggenheim, not sure about others.\\nif you enjoy sailing, you might check out a sailboat ride, we did it this week and it was delightful and we were able to be under sail almost the entire time of the 2 hours https://sail-nyc.com/browse-by-boat/schooner-adirondack/ The M Social Hotel that NYWhiz mentions above is scheduled to open on Thursday May 27. If this were my first trip, i would make sure to see:\\nStatue of Liberty (statuecruises.com)\\n911 Memorial and Museum\\nEmpire State Building\\nMetropolitan\\nNatural History Museum\\nCentral Park (look at a map and see what you\\'d like to see in the park)\\nTimes Square Surely you have some attractions/places/etc selected for a trip to one of the great world cities....right?\\nI mean, you are coming in a few weeks. Helping to organize an itinerary is one thing. Planning/building one is another.\\nDo you have a list of attractions? Many consider Madison Sq Garden iconic. Many consider Central Park iconic. Many consider spending a day shopping at Macy\\'s sorta iconic...or a can\\'t miss when visiting nYc. Many consider visiting Coney Island iconic.\\nJust this 4 examples show how endless the opportunities are in NYC.\\nStart building a \"must see\" and \"would like to see\" list. Re-post and you will get some solid feedback. My wife has been to New York City many times. Shopping at Macy’s Manhattan and Bloomingdale’s will always be on her to do list. ^\\nExactly.\\nSome would not miss an opportunity to do that. Some would not bother. Our family of 6- 2 adults 4 kids are flying into LaGuardia in a few weeks. Staying in midtown-South for the week. We are first timers and I need suggestions on getting to our hotel!\\nI had noticed the train/subway doesn’t leave out straight from the airport and saw you’d have to take the bus to the first subway entrance or uber to an entrance.\\nAlso, my hubby is very reluctant to take the subway at least to and from the airport with our luggage because he has read several articles of an uptick of crime and is afraid we will be targeted while carrying around our luggage.\\nI plan to get us all cards to ride around for the week and he’s fine with that too, but to and from the airport he is very leery.\\nCan y’all provide feedback on our options and if there are reasonable alternatives? Also, how long is the ride from the airport to manhattan?\\nThanks in advance! The bus to subway option is cheap and pretty straightforward https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/public-transportation\\nYour whole group will probably not fit in a single Yellow cab or a standard car service vehicle.\\nYou could book a larger capacity car service and I vehicle at a premium price. Car service vehicles are not permitted to do terminal curbside pick ups. You must meet them at the designated meeting area https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides\\nI\\'d probably split up into two groups and take cabs from the official Yellow cab dispatcher line https://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/by-taxi Ignore any touts offering (illegal) rides\\nThe time needed varies by method and time of arrival\\nEdited: 9:25 am, May 24, 2021 P.S. this video might help you understand and decide about the transit option https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U77L8hTNF58\\nBe aware the video was made while LGA was in the midst of construction of the new terminal B - but the general guidance is still accurate:;\\nBuy Metrocards before going to bus stop > get SBS proof of payment receipt before boarding bus > transfer to subway at Jackson Heights (Which subway line to transfer to depends on hotel location) No one is going to mess with you because of your luggage. You will blend right in with all the locals who routinely use public transit to and from the airport. From your lodging thread your kids are 11 > 13 except for a 3 year old and you are planning to bring a jogging stroller?\\nFor that reason I\\'m inclined to agree the transit option to/from LGA may be a bit challenging (but doable if one of you can wrangle the youngest and the others handle the luggage)\\nPlus IMO arriving by Yellow cab is a classic NYC experience\\nBe aware that few subway stations have elevators and typically 2 to 4 flights of stairs. You can check the \"accessible trip\" option on the MTA trip planner to help you choose routes http://tripplanner.mta.info/MyTrip/ui_web/customplanner/TripPlanner.aspx Strollers must be folded on city buses. Do not block movement of other passenger to the doors or aisles on the train (try to position yourselves towards the end of the train car you ride in)\\nEdited: 11:33 am, May 24, 2021 How old are your kids - old enough to help with luggage and know not to wander off? Most taxis don\\'t hold 6, and car apps also have limits. I would order a car service from Carmel or Dial 7 for your ride from LaGuardia. Sometimes getting off a flight with luggage and a bunch of kids is not an opportune time to figure out public transportation for the first time. Going back to the airport, you may have already gotten used to it and will feel differently about taking public transportation. Thanks for the replies so far. Stairs are no biggie for us. The 3 older kids are well behaved and self sufficient. Our 3 year old does listen well and shouldn’t be an issue.\\nHow long is the subway ride from Queens to midtown south?\\nI know subway will be the cheapest option- I just wonder how much taxi service would be at least to get there and back to the hotel.\\nOn our last night we are transitioning to a hotel right by LaGuardia because we have a super early flight so we will have to head that way to check in the day before.\\nI’m trying to nip the transportation issue now so I am squared away before we go! There is no set fare for cabs to and from LaGuardia. It will vary based on traffic conditions.\\nYou can try playing with costs on your own Uber app at different times of day, plugging in your hotel address and your terminal at LaGuardia. I use the Citymapper transportation app and I find it extremely useful. Define midtown south.\\nThe time needed varies by subway route (local or express) Use the trip planner linked above to get an idea of options and timing\\nYou can also get price quotes from the car services websites (Dial 7, Carmel, etc.)\\nI am unsure about the utility of moving hotels for your last night.\\nNone of the hotels are on the airport proper or convenient to the Q70 bus. If you need to take a car service or cabs early AM traffic is usually very light for a quick ride from Manhattan Agree, if it’s early enough, LaGuardia can be 25 minutes away by cab, it’s not so far that I think the time spent on your last night moving hotels is worth it. (Or at least, it wouldn’t be to me.). And a local hotel would probably require a taxi anyhow.\\nGo to the app recommended and plug in the locations to give you better time estimates. I appreciate your attention to detail, especially moving around such a large family. But you may be overthinking this. Here is the high level itinerary that I put together for our June 12th-15th trip. 2 adults and 2 14 year olds. Looking for feedback and thoughts and if there is anything else we should squeeze in!! We are staying at Hotel Edison. Would love feedback on unique restaurant reservations also.\\nSaturday - Arrive at hotel around noon. Check bags and walk to Patzeria Perfect Pizza for lunch. Hoping The Ride will be open by then or potentially just exploring the area. Go back to hotel to check in bags and then visit Empire State Building. Dinner then back to hotel.\\nSunday - 9/11 Memorial and Museum, Lunch at Shake Shack, Explore Central Park, Dinner, Harbor Lights Circle Line Tour\\nMon - Visit Biggie Smalls Mural, Coney Island with lunch at Nathans, Hotel to Rest, Dinner, Ghost of Greenwich Walking Tour\\nTues - Intrepid Space OR Metropolitan of Art, Lunch, The Edge, Dinner\\nWed - 6 am flight home :( You are up ad down and all over town. You need to get a flat map of Manhattan and group activities near each other. It\\'s doable, but just a waste of time traveling .\\nFor example, you should do the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the same day as Central Park, the museum is on the east side of the Park.\\nYou can do the Intrepid before the Circle Line.\\nOn Sunday, there is more to see downtown in the Financial District beyond the 9/11 Memorial. I would try to go to Federal Hall, your 14 year olds will get a good dose of American history that is interesting. The website says that it is still closed, but there is a new exhibit there, it\\'s open (check the calendar part, it is being updated with new exhibits even if the home page isn\\'t updated).\\nI would walk the Highline after the Edge. It\\'s pretty. And consider Little Island. The 9/11 Museum is intense and may not be suitable for everyone It requires timed tickets. The Memorial is open and free.\\nCheck https://downtownny.com/ for other things to see & do nearby The Met Museum is currently closed on Tues. and Weds. Yes, better grouping is required. As is, your Sunday is far too much for one day. The 9/11 Museum is emotionally intense and deserves at least 3 hours. I would also caution that it may very well be too much for a younger teenager, but only you know your kids.\\nDefinitely agree with the Intrepid before the Circle Line.\\nIn your other thread, I provided this great link for Downtown information:\\nhttps://downtownny.com/explore/\\nFederal Hall is a great visit and if they\\'re doing their free tours, it is very informative.\\nYou could walk the Brooklyn Bridge or do so many other things, depends on your interest. I know many have said that the 911 museum can be too intense for that age kids. Our 8th graders in town go for a NYC trip and that is on their itinerary. We are a small town so everyone knows everyone and there hasn\\'t been one complaint about that. Just thought i\\'d throw that out there. Per the National 9/11 Museum\\'s website, the suggested minimum age for kids is 10. I have actually talked to several people about the 9/11 museum who know my kids and got their feedback on the intensity. They all felt that it wouldn\\'t be too much and while emotional...would be something that they should see.\\nThank you for the feedback - I was trying to do one big thing each morning and one in the afternoon/evenings not really thinking about where things are located. I will look at everything again and try to make some modifications. One more thing - I had a friend suggest that I visit Canal Street for black market purses. Is the area safe? dont buy the black market purses, they are illegal\\nThe Biggie Smalls mural isnt really near anything. Id skip that unless you really realy want to see it, it wil waste about an hour for a 5 minute attration\\nAlso its about an hour each way from Midtown to Coney Island, Im not saying you shoudnt go there, but it will take you an hour each way BTW I think there are 2 Biggie Smalls Mural, I went to one and it seems there was another one somewhere else And not just at Nathan\\'s. Maybe have a hot dog for old time\\'s sake and end with some cotton candy but there\\'s a lot more out there.\\nPollo milanesa cemita for one.\\nGreat article from Eater: https://ny.eater.com/2021/5/24/22447594/best-food-restaurants-coney-island I always enjoy reading about Robert Sietsema\\'s adventures . . . but was distressed to learn from this that Totonno\\'s may be closed?!? Hope it\\'s just a temporary thing.\\nI gotta say, that cemita looks daunting. According to their website, Totonno\\'s only opens Thursday thru to Sunday, noon to 8.00pm.\\nThat cemita does look big, Robert said it was big and they finished half of it, but that was after they\\'d also sampled lots of other foods. I\\'d give it a red hot go! Lol. I am about to fly from Newark\\'s Terminal A via JetBlue Airways to the West Coast.\\nCurious, if anyone have flown out of this terminal recently. Are there long security lines in the morning? I have TSA Pre-Check.\\nThank you You should repost on the Newark NJ forum. Terminal A is a pod design and you will only have access to your airlines pod post security. The last time I flew out of A was American and I remember it being a very narrow single line with maybe 2 or 3 actual detectors.\\nEdited: 3:47 pm, May 25, 2021 The Newark Airport website gives real time security wait times.\\nhttps://newarkairport.com/\\nOf course if you\\'re leaving tomorrow that won\\'t be helpful. Otherwise take a look in the morning. I need BEST itinerary suggestions , 2 days in NY city June 25-27, staying with relatives in Hempstead Long Island. I will be driving the entire time, my mom cant do stairs and much walking, I will need parking for a SUV. I need help creating an itinerary please, thanks\\nEdited: 9:30 am, May 25, 2021 I was thinking of doing Natural science museum , going to central park , china town and maybe statue of liberty. I might be too ambitions with parking concerns and proximity to sites, advice please. Thanks\\nEdited: 9:39 am, May 25, 2021 You might want to see if your relatives in Hempstead can assist you with renting a mobility scooter for your mom. We\\'ve had to rent them twice in recent years for elderly/injured houseguests. (In Manhattan, we rented from Big Apple Mobility; they drop off and pick up, and the scooters fit into the trunks of cabs and backs of SUVs).\\nYou don\\'t say how many kids and what ages exactly, but with small kids and a mobility-challenged grandmother -- and a car -- I wouldn\\'t try to be too ambitions. Here are a couple of ideas:\\nDay 1\\nPark at the American Museum of Natural History -- it has an airport-style parking garage, big vehicles are fine. and there are elevators. For your visit to AMNH, right now timed tickets purchased in advance are still requited. If your mom doesn\\'t have a scooter, you can borrow a wheelchair while at AMNH.\\nAMNH is right on Central Park, so you can explore there and then come back to AMNH for your car. (The garage is open later than the museum). Lots of restaurants on the Upper West Side when a meal is needed. Central Park might be hard for your mom without a scooter, though. :(\\nDay 2\\nConsider taking a Classic Harbor Line cruise from Chelsea Piers. Small, comfortable boats -- your mom can sit the whole time and have great views, including the Statue of Liberty up close. The boat\\'s cabins are also safe for small children, great views through the big windows while sitting on a banquette. (I have 4 kids aged 2, 3, 5, and 5). You can take a 90-minute harbor cruise or a 3-hour cruise around Manhattan -- lots of options; see the website:\\nhttps://sail-nyc.com\\nChelsea Piers has a large parking lot right next to the boat\\'s boarding dock, and your SUV will not be a problem there.\\nGood luck! :) Driving from place to place in Manhattan will waste time and increase your parking hassles & expenses\\nI\\'d plot your must sees on a map and then find one garage for each day (check icon parking Spot Hero or Best Parking)\\nThen use the transit system or cabs to get from place to place as needed.\\nCheck the \"accessible trip\" option on the trip planner to find the best routes https://new.mta.info/ The bus system is fully accessible so it will be of more use than the subway\\nIf you want to visit Liberty & Ellis Islands buy timed tickets from Statue Cruises ASAP\\nSounds as if you should plan one day downtown and another uptown. If you want to go to the Statue of Liberty , Drive to Liberty State Park in NJm there is a parking lot there Downtown there is a free ADA accessible bus around the more popular sights https://downtownny.com/about-us/services/downtown-connection-bus/\\nIf you don\\'t go to the SOL consider a ride on the (free) Staten Island ferry for memorable statue, harbor and skyline views\\nEdited: 10:49 am, May 25, 2021 You do not say why your relative is in a wherlchair (and I am NOT asking for personal info) but does she have the stamina to handle some of what you are proposing?\\nGoing to the Statue of Liberty is a time consuming, somewhat mentally strenuous endeavor involving airport style security the ferry rides and such.\\nI like Frangipani’s boat ride idea. That would likely give you a good view of SOL.\\nBut if your kids are young, will they be ok being in one place for a long period of time? All kids are different. You don’t mention their ages. My kids are grown but at age 5 one would have loved the boat ride, the other would have been bored.\\nEdited: 10:52 am, May 25, 2021 Thank you so very much, this information is extremely helpful My mom has really bad knees and walking for more than 10 mins is near impossible, the children are under 10. How many are you? The typical Yellow cab holds 4 only a few hold 5. But \"an additional passenger must be accepted if such passenger is under the age of seven (7) and is held on the lap of an adult passenger seated in the rear.\" https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/passenger-frequently-asked-questions.page The trunks are plenty roomy for a folded wheelchair Since this will be the hardest on your mom, what are her priorities? If she has any must-see items, then the itinerary should be built around that. I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this, because I would never otherwise suggest it, but maybe a bus tour (HOHO) would be good to give your family the highlights, but just stay on the bus the whole time.\\nI agree that moving the car from place to place will run up HUNDREDS of dollars in charges. Get in early, there are usually \"arrive by 9 or 10, leave by 6\" type specials in many garages. Otherwise, you\\'ll end up with $40 to $60 charges at each garage. We have reservations for timed entry at noon on Saturday. but....here\\'s where the confusion is... It\\'s my 2 kids (both students) and myself. So I reserved for the NJ/NY/CT Student timed entry pay what you wish. But i\\'m not a student.\\n1. Do i make a separate timed entry reservation for myself?\\n2. Neither of them can find their school i.d.\\'s! How much of a problem will that be?\\nThanks in advance for any suggestions/guidance. You should contact the museum for answers to such specific questions\\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/contact\\nOne of the regulars on this forum is a volunteer at the Met. She may comment if she sees your post. The museum is currently closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays I\\'ve had burgers at 4 of the places on this list -- Brooklyn Ice House, Superiority Burger, Shake Shack, and 5 Napkin -- all were great:\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/best-burgers-nyc?cid=email~emailname%3DNEW%20YORK%20EN_NEWSLETTER_20210520~jobid%3DDM1970~crmid%3Deb208486-3ebb-43fa-a555-937d649044b1&deliveryName=DM1970 Well, I can vouch for #17. Burgers are not something I\\'ve had in NYC, the only one has been at Five Napkin over 10 years ago.\\nBut there\\'s a few on that list that I like the look of. Pat La Frieda\\'s is one. Red Hook Tavern\\'s is another. And maybe the Black Label at Minetta Tavern.\\nHere\\'s a clickable link.\\n(Edit. Just remembered I had a quick Shake Shack burger once).\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/best-burgers-nyc\\nEdited: 7:01 pm, May 21, 2021 The Mr and I had the the Black Label at Minetta Tavern. It was an excellent burger and we loved the old school vibe. Honestly, those lists are nice - but highly depend on the individual taste. Smokey, juicy, toasty, etc.\\nMinetta is nice. Also black burger, etc. But even good upscale restaurants serve quite good ones.\\nRe Shake Shack - I have to say that the burger quality significantly decreased over the last few months. I\\'m now hungry and craving a burger.\\nAnd it\\'s not even 8am here. People have been going to #12 for years. It\\'s a little known pub known to locals in the Queens area. This voluntary group has been around for years and are now back doing what they do, showing visitors to NYC around their own city.\\nIt\\'s a free service and they\\'re not official tour guides, just locals who are passionate about their city and want to show you around a neighbourhood or two. It\\'s like walking and riding with a new friend.\\nThey\\'ll show you how to ride the subway and buses if needed, and show you some sights in your chosen neighbourhood.\\nIt\\'s best to request a Greeter on your first full day in the city so you can learn the ropes of the subway and buses and feel comfortable, then you can get around confidently after that on your own.\\nAlthough it\\'s a free service it\\'s suggested a donation is made when applying, and no payment or tipping is required on the day to the Greeter (but a drink or lunch or coffee would always be welcome).\\nhttps://www.bigapplegreeter.org/\\nTip: if you\\'re not sure about which neighbourhood to see, you can select Greeter\\'s Choice and be surprised. This is also a way to help ensure you get a Greeter.\\nAnd some FAQS: https://www.bigapplegreeter.org/volunteer-faqs\\nEdited: 6:42 pm, May 23, 2021 And more FAQS: https://www.bigapplegreeter.org/visitor-faqs How wonderful!\\nI had a fabulous experience with a Big Apple Greeter on my first visit to NYC. I had a Greeter on my first visit too. It was invaluable to me with the subway help. I felt so confident after that. We went to Harlem as well as Brooklyn Heights using the subway and a bus. I was surprised that we went to two areas because I had assumed it would only be one. Licensed NYC tourist guides are back too. Actually they\\'ve never left. Many pivoted to virtual during the pandemic and you can preview some of them at www.nyadventureclub.com . You can find more about licensed guides here. www.touryourowncity.com Good to know ztaks. It’s all good. https://www.broadway.com/buzz/200777/a-complete-guide-to-broadways-reopening/\\nHere\\'s a list from Broadway.com of known Broadway show reopening or opening dates. Just a warning, if you do decide to book tickets, please do not do so via broadway.com as they charge very high fees. I would suggest going through playbill.com, on the theater\\'s website or directly on telecharge.com.\\nI do have a question: is this list subject to change? there are only musicals on it except for Birthday Candles (on my wish list) in March 2022.\\nEdited: 11:13 am, May 15, 2021 The list is subject to change\\nAlso be aware the ticket prices are very high, They will likely have to lower them as international tourists likely wont be welcome back in the Fall. They are going to have to rely on locals to buy ticketes and after the initial opening days, the prices will have to plunge Trouble in Mind is also a straight play. I do remember seeing a little part of Six during an online gala of some type and I remember that this owuld be something I would go see. Six is great, we saw it in Cambridge, but it is VERY short, so plan an early dinner afterwards. Since I don\\'t know when the borders will reopen between Canada and the US and I am waiting for that before purchasing any Broadway ticket. Just playing it safe. They are also making a more liberal refund policy\\nUnfortunatly there are people who might test postive, but arent sick (Asymptomatic) with a pair of $400 orchestra tickets to Hamilton who will go anyway if the tickets arent refundable (Some might go even if they are) Yes, the list will I\\'m sure change. Also note the period from just after Labor Day to just before Columbus Day is usually slower, with many discounts -- though probably not for shows like Hamilton or Lion King -- so if you are thinking of going then I would not rush out to buy now.\\nI did not post the list as an endorsement of that site or any show, but just to give people an idea of what\\'s on.\\nI think plays, many of which (unlike musicals) are more dependent on local audiences, will generally be slower to return.\\n. Hello, I looked at prices for big name musicals in the last week of December and they seem to be a tad high - around $200pp.\\nGiven that the availability seems a bit low, should I assume that the prices are going to remain that way (supply vs demand etc) or can I follow the tips on this page:\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/cheap-broadway-tickets\\nTrying to understand if I should just go ahead and book the tickets to the shows I want right now (given that they seem to be fully refundable up to the day through broadway.com) or wait until I\\'m in Manhattan at Christmas and try to buy them on the day?\\nThanks. No one can say what demand for Broadway tickets will be at Christmas, but in a normal year, tickets are in high demand over the holidays and performances are also reduced (no show Christmas Eve, only some shows play Christmas Day). The only thing you gain by waiting is flexibility, you won\\'t get tickets more cheaply,if you can get them at all. I rarely wait until I am in NYC to buy my Broadway tickets, and for my Christmas trip I never wait until I arrive. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 1:00 pm, September 06, 2021 Take the Air train to Path to World Trade Center (detailed instructions on the first link on the right hand side of this page, how to travel to manhattan from all airports). Walk through the Oculus, the whole length of it from the PATH to the entry to subways, follow the corridor, there are signs to the 4-5 Fulton Stop, take uptown to 14th at union station and walk from there. You can\\'t get on the PATH from the AirTrain. You\\'d first have to take the AirTrain to the Newark Airport rail station, then a New Jersey Transit train one stop to Newark (NOT New York) Penn Station, then a PATH train to the World Trade Center, and then the 4 or 5 uptown subway to 14th Street/Union Square. That’s why I said look at the detailed instructions. A lot is effort went in to drafting them.\\nEdited: 3:53 pm, May 22, 2021 I know the OP said no taxi/Uber, and as a transit booster (and a cheapskate), I respect that. HOWEVER, as a veteran of this route (except I continue on to Brooklyn rather than the EV), I’d suggest at least considering a cab for the short trip from the terminal to Newark Penn. No need to wait for the Airtrain, make the rounds of the various stops, then wait again for a NJT train (which are not super-frequent); depending on how many of you there are, the cab fare is barely more than the train ticket(s) and possibly even less.\\nAnyhow, that’s the little “hack” I discovered after a particularly frustrating Airtrain-NJT-PATH journey, and I’ve now done it several times.\\nThere’s also a public bus that will take you from the terminal to Newark Penn, but I’ve never used it and don’t know the logistics. Linda, I know you’re a light traveler, admirably. Like you, I find the waits in between connections annoying and a waste of time. But what I don’t like is schlepping bags up and down stairs. Does the cab to Penn Newark add to or eliminate some of that schlepping? Escalators from terminals to the air train are pretty good, I find the connections required, even though there are several, are fairly intuitive, even if time consuming, so once I decide on public transportation, I do it the whole way, and don’t even think about it. But if I have a big bag, I uber or cab the whole way. I never do a hybrid of public/car to Newark. Curious if you would make a different choice if you had a suitcase that was heavy and large enough that it needed to be checked.\\nCab for me is about 45 minutes. The PATH route takes about an hour and five minutes.\\nOn Friday I’m taking the PATH because I think traffic with be a b—-h.\\nParadoxically, I fly home into LGA, and always take a cab.\\nEdited: 5:29 pm, May 22, 2021 I’d say the cab to Newark Penn eliminates some of the schlepping; it certainly doesn’t add to it. Finding a cab is easier than finding the Airtrain (not that finding the Airtrain is hard), and IIRC, getting from the NJT platform to the PATH platform can be kind of a pain, especially if you’re loaded down. (That said, it’s been a long time since I’ve done this.)\\nUnless it’s very early or very late, I pretty much always use public transit to get to whichever airport, even when my rolling suitcase is overstuffed, I’m weighed down with a heavy backpack, and I’m bringing the tripod for my birding scope. Oh, and add in a shopping bag full of snacks & miscellany if the trip is to pick up a rental car. (I’m not always such a light packer!)\\nThat’s just my quirk, I guess. Yeah, I got back to LGA 11:40PM - cab all the way, no other consideration. ;)\\nOP, here is a link to the detailed instructions referred to above (from the Top Questions), scroll down for information about Newark Airport. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13187699-How_do_I_get_from_the_airport_JFK_LGA_EWR_to_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nIf you choose one of the options that puts you into Penn Station, you could take the subway C train to 14th Street, change to the L train to Union Square. I think the Path to WTC option is better as it\\'s one less subway change. Here is a video about the air train in Newark. I used it shortly before the pandemic and found the whole process incredibly simple and everything was clearly marked.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMHrmbXGAVU My next in my series of Upper Manhattan and Da Bronx Trip Report\\nMy first Stop was Hamilton Grange, This was the Summer home of Alexander Hamilton, Its the only home of Hamilton that remains. It is located in St Nicholas Park, Itself an Interesting Park as its sort of on a cliff. You have to climb up a hill to see the house. right now the House was closed. Im not sure when it will re-open. Obviously its gotten popular since Hamilton the Musical Came out\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPO28UWNaho/\\nRight behind the Hamilton Grange is City College. Its one of the oldest Colleges in NYC and dates from 1847, It used to be known as the Free Academy\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPO3V0gtZus/\\nMy Next stop was the Little Red Lighthouse under the Great Gray Bridge, Made famous from a childrens book. This has to be by far the hardest NYC landmark to find, I had tried to figure out how to get there from Google Maps and when I got there it wasnt correct. Took me like 20 Mins to figure out how to get there, but it was worth it. This has to be one of the most picturesque places in NYC and almost nobody knows about it, There is a steep cliff you have to climb up and down to get to it. But if you can do the walk and can find it, A big treasure awaits. If you want to go to a place in NYC nobody else has this is it.\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPOSKsFNHeA/\\nMy Last stop was the Bronx Victory Memorial In Pelham Bay park, I missed this a few weeks ago and stoped by it on the way home. It probably would be more famous if it was located somewhere else and not in the Bronx\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPO36-rtwsJ/ I used to pass the Bronx Memorial daily on the bus to work for many years. It was heavily vandalized and covered with graffiti, but then restored and the figure regilt. The grid of trees that may still survive was relocated from the Grand Concourse when the subway was built.\\nThere is actually a video on how to get to the Little Red Lighthouse and the route seems a bit scary and desolate.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tUKPe3F9pg Great to follow your exploring\\nIMO the City College campus is well worth a look as it has a variety of traditional and modern buildings https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/about/campusmap\\nThere are some good places for a meal/snack to the west of the campus along Amsterdam or Broadway\\nThere is also a cluster of brownstones just north of Hamilton Grange\\nRiverbank state park nearby on the Hudson river https://parks.ny.gov/parks/93 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverbank_State_Park\\nEdited: 8:03 am, May 24, 2021 I found the video on how to get to the Lighthouse\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tUKPe3F9pg&ab_channel=The80sQuadrantThe80sQuadrant\\nI had mostly followed this route except I made a wrong turn and made about a 10 minute out of the way .detour.\\nThe Lighthouse is near Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters so you could combine a trip to both of them\\nHamilton Grange and City College are not that far from the Jumeal Mansion/Sylvan Lane and the High Bridge , so you could combine those areas I\\'ve seen the Little Red Lighthouse from the water, on a boat tour of lighthouses organized by the National Lighthouse Museum on Staten Island (next to the Staten Island Ferry terminal in St. George.) I imagine they will continue to have those tours from time to time again in the future.\\nEdited: 11:08 am, May 24, 2021 You could see the Lighthouse from the Circle line, but you don\\'t get the right shot angle So interesting. Someday I will go see the Lighthouse..... For those that dont know the Lighthouse has a Classic Childrens book about it. I know many here like to read about NYC\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/2jj5pber I never read the lighthouse book, but it was read to me by the school librarian in 1954. This 1942 book was already popular by then. We visited Hamilton Grange when we were in NYC in 2019. I wish we had known about, (and been able to find), The Little Red Lighthouse. I have a particular affinity for lighthouses.\\nThanks for sharing your pics. They were great! I actually know of at least 6 Lighthouses in NYC\\nThe Statue of Liberty is Actually a Lighthouse\\nThe Little Red Lighthouse in Upper Manhattan\\nThere is a Lighthouse by the Throggs Neck Bridge in the Long Island City near Queens and the Bronx called Stepping Stones Lighthouse. You can see it from the Throogs Neck Bridge\\nThere is a Lighthouse at the Tip of Roosevelt Island on the North End. You can see it on Roosevelt Island if you take the Bus or walk to the North End of the Island from the Tram\\nThere is the Coney Island Lighthouse in Seagate, you can see this from the Rockaway Ferry (Seagate is a private community and outsiders cannot enter)\\nThere is also a Fake Lighthouse on Breezy Point in Rockaway (It looks like a lighthouse, but was used as a Decoy during WW2) you can also see this from the Rockaway Ferry, Breezy Point is also a private community and no outsiders We are traveling from E 45th St in Manhattan to 1 Oak St Brooklyn. This is the Skyline Drive in. From what I can tell we will get off the subway at Greenpoint Ave and need to walk about 10 minutes to our destination. Is this a safe area to walk? We will arrive around 6:30 pm and be leaving around 11pm. Deadly dangerous place. Just up the road people are throwing axes. Around the corner others are getting stabbed with needles. No need to worry. You will be in hipster central. First of all let me say I am so happy and grateful to see this site returning to a TRAVEL forum instead of the Covid information and Political Debate site it became. I always knew my favorite city would return and am happy to see it awakening.\\nI have started planning for the weekend before Thanksgiving, one of my two typical yearly visits that didn’t happen in 2020. I have booked a cancellable reservation at one of my favorite hotels, the Solita Soho. Location, location, location. Hopefully the Landmark Coffee Shop across the street has survived for breakfast. I have not booked a flight yet, chiefly because there’s a good chance I will have moved before then. I still have a credit with United from my aborted flight in May of 2020 but it’s good for another year still so not tied to it. I should be certain enough by the end of June to decide where to fly from.\\nI look forward to seeing all my favorite haunts and friends there, we’ll all be a couple of years older and wiser. Also keeping my fingers crossed to see American Utopia again, hopefully Broadway will be flying high again. Please keep the lights on for me. Glad to hear this! I’m excited that travel is becoming a possibility again. My brother and sister-in-law from Chicago are also thinking about visiting in November...they’re Drive-By Truckers groupies & the Truckers are spending a week at Brooklyn Bowl in Williamsburg in the first part of the month.\\nTravel, concerts, visiting family: it all seems so...normal. ***I’m excited that travel is becoming a possibility again***\\nOutside of last March, April, and possibly May, many people never stopped traveling. NYC is eager for your return Scott! I cannot wait to get back to New York from the UK Greates city and people in the world A big shout out of ABSOLUTELY to your first paragraph, Scott! I haven’t looked at the forum in a couple of weeks, but what a pleasant surprise to turn up today and see pages af travel topics.\\nI don’t think I’ll be able to join the party in November despite finding some great hotel rates. Looking forward to hearing about your adventures! The city has become extremely active Scott. I think it will be even more active once we get into June and as we move through the summer. Maybe October for us. But that will all depend on Canada and its Border Re-entry Protocols. Would be rather shocking if the canadian border doesn\\'t open up by october It is \"sort of open\" as people can come and go. It is the return to Canada and all the quarantine regulations,\\nNothing is stopping me from leaving, question is \"to where\" except for probably the US. I just don\\'t want to go through the required \"hotel quarantine\". The loophole is if by entering Canada via the land border. A hassle AFAIC. I agree with you Scott. The forum is back to normal. It\\'s so nice to read about people\\'s trip plans again.\\nEnjoy your planning Scott!\\nEdited: 12:35 pm, May 24, 2021 Saturday we are spending at museum of natural history. Sunday at met and Central Park, and at little island . Need recs for Monday- will be a bit museumed out… me and 11 year old daughter Hudson River Greenway, Hudson Yards, High Line, Little Island (if you can get tickets), and so on.\\nWalk across the Brooklyn Bridge, go to Governors Island, etc.\\nhttps://littleisland.org/\\nIf you like walking, here is a great site for self guided walking tours:\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html Do you know of any historical new Amsterdam walks? The tours seem to not run on mondays. I don’t mind paying or doing a self guided one Where are you staying? There could be something nearby that will be easy to get to.\\nBesides museums what do you like doing?\\nFor outdoor stuff, there\\'s also the Statue of Liberty, 9/11 Memorial, Wall Street etc. These are all downtown in an area that\\'s very different from the UWS and UES. It would be a good change and see another part of Manhattan.\\nOr you could plan an easy day doing something in the morning then having a nice afternoon tea together? You\\'re welcome.\\nIf a tour is available on the weekend, you could always switch your days around to accommodate the walking tour.\\nAlso, be flexible with weather, you might want to switch things around if it rains on a day where you had outdoor activities planned, etc. Would recommend exploring downtown things like financial district, union square, washington square park, the village, the high line, herald square, chinatown, koreatown etc, etc . many many choices with different neighborhoods to explore. Unfortunately the timed entries at the museums meant I had to prepay them and the met is not open Monday so if it is really rainy I can move museum of nh to Monday probably.\\nI did spend every weekend in ny growing up but never as a tourist. I was mostly in midtown and Lincoln center though, Carnegie hall area. Bummed that Carnegie deli is closed!!\\nWe did Staten Island ferry last trip, I would do Statue of Liberty if we can go to the crown! So will wait for next trip.\\nI don’t know if a paid view is worth it- Empire State Building, top of the rock, one world or the Hudson one. The yoga there looks amazing…\\nWe are going in less than two weeks. My daughter wants a beautiful Michelin star lunch but I’m trying to keep this budget 😆 Oh and I’m staying at Hyatt place near herald square. Yay for no resort fees!! You\\'ll be very close to the Empire State Building. That\\'s a very iconic thing to see and go to the top. The city views are amazing. And your daughter might get a kick out of seeing the life size King Kong breaking into the building. You had me scared there for a sec as I plan on visiting the Met on a Monday. From my confirmation email: Open Thursday–Monday: 10am–5pm NEW YORK—Mayor Bill de Blasio today signed an Executive Order eliminating the 5.875% hotel room occupancy tax rate for a three-month period, from June 1, 2021 to August 31, 2021. The relief provided by the tax rate reduction is designed to help accelerate the recovery of the hotel industry, which has been particularly hit hard by the pandemic. This executive action will help hotels keep their doors open, retain jobs, and gain a more stable footing as the city continues its path toward a full recovery.\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/375-21/recovery-all-us-mayor-de-blasio-relief-new-york-city-s-hotel-industry Some years back, NYC imposed a considerably higher hotel tax. This was rolled back when the number of conventions declined. Reducing it now might encourage tourists to return. Anyone know if it will still be eliminated with a reservation already made for that time frame? I booked in March for dates in mid-June. I couldn’t find info from the article so was curious! Most billing systems are set up to charge your invoice with the \"as incurred\" taxes. Local and state taxes can be quite variable, so I always consider the taxes quoted on any kind of reservation as an estimate at the time of booking - not necessarily what will be incurred at the time of payment.\\nBut yes, good news indeed for my end of June weekend booking! We (my sister and myself) have an upcoming visit to NYC planned in late June. Until this past week I thought we had our hotel issue resolved but now Wyndham Resorts has stepped up and really screwed us and I am looking at other options. We were scheduled via a time share trip my sister booked via Wyndham and this past week they switched us from the New Yorker Hotel to a hotel I refuse to stay in due to its location and massive amounts of horrible reviews. So now I am looking at other options but have never really looked for a hotel in NYC.\\nBoth my sister and myself have health and mobility issues so I am trying to find a hotel that does not require alot of walking from public transportation as that is what made the New Yorker a good option for us as we will be coming into the city via the NJ transit train into Penn Station. Any suggestions for avenues to ID some hotels would be great. I have already ID\\'s one hotel called the Stewart which is in that area and would not require to much wallking with luggage in tow to get to it. Since you mention mobility issues, would you enjoy an area with lots of restaurants nearby so you easily can find a lot of places within an easy, short walk, after a long day of sightseeing? I know I do, and I have some mobility issues. But then again, food is important to me when traveling, perhaps less so for you. I can\\'t remember how long your stay is, but staying further from Penn Station might make sense for a place with a more residential feel. You can easily grab a cab from Penn Station when you arrive, if you\\'re willing to stay elsewhere.\\nTribeca is a good area, in my opinion. Lots and lots of restaurants. You can easily have breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout your stay in a new place. Very close to several subway stations. Which ones will depend on which hotel you choose. Also several bus lines that serve the area. I like the local buses when I want to rest my feet for a few blocks without having to go down the stairs in a subway station.\\nThe Roxy Hotel Tribeca is close to Franklin Street subway station for the 1 subway line and Canal Street Station for the A, C and E.\\nThe Frederick hotel is close to Chambers street station (right outside the door) for the 1, 2 and 3. The next Chambers street station for the A and C is about a 2 min walk from the hotel. A bit further, 5 - 7 minutes or so, you have two subway stations, one for the R and W and one for 4, 5 and 6. By using one of those four stations, you can easily get to the Upper West Side (American Museum of Natural History), Greenwich Village, Upper East Side (for the Met Museum), the sights in Midtown as well as down to Battery Park for the ferries to Statue of Liberty. Yes, I was going to suggest Stewart, directly across the street from the Penn Station 7th Ave entrance. About a block further east Is the Martinique, though I believe it is currently closed.\\nAbout 3 blocks south of Penn Station 7th Ave entrance, on W 28 between 6th and 7th Aves, there are several newish sliver hotels like Hilton Garden Inn. They usually describe themselves as being in Chelsea but are really in midtown south and are very convenient for Penn Station. There is a local 1 subway stop at 28 and 7th and downtown buses run on 7th, with uptown buses on 6th. 28th St is also home to what\\'s left of NY\\'s flower market and can be busy and congested, esp. in morning and early afternoon.\\nEdited: 2:58 pm, May 23, 2021 Another way to look for hotels is via something like booking.com and use their Property Accessibility and Room Accessibility filters. You select whether you want wheelchair accessibility and shower grab rails for example. You can also use neighbourhood filters to narrow down on the area you prefer to stay.\\nCheck reviews, and also check where the subway stations are in regards to any hotels you like by using google maps.\\nYou could then compare the rates directly with the hotel\\'s offers on their website. Budget generally rules hotel decisions. It would help us help you to know your dates and budget. ( hotel prices fluctuate by date).\\nThe area around Penn station is not the most attractive. It seems a shame to select a hotel location just because that,s where you\\'re arriving. A taxi to a nicer area might make more sense. Another poster recently mentioned the M Social ahotel is running a special promotion. The details are listed in post #5 here\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13553027-Hotel_location_advice-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThe location is more attractive than around Penn Station. HELP! Going to NYC March 2022; would like 2 sleeping areas, perhaps a sleeper sofa and separate bedroom? Any thoughts? With all the hotels in NYC it\\'s crazy trying to go through each one to find that time of suite. thanks The Residence Inn Downtown/World Trade Center has rooms that have separate bedroom, the sitting area with pull out sofa and small kitchen. The Avalon has a one bedroom suite with a king bed and a sofa in the liv room.\\nLots of hotels offer suites, but which one depends greatly on your budget. In addition, prices vary by date, plus all suites may not be available on your dates.\\nhttps://www.suiteness.com/suites/united-states/new-york/new-york/hotels\\nI suggest looking this website for suites. Do the proper research via the hotels website as well , although you may think that is “crazy”. Finding something that fits for you will take effort on your part. Hotel chains to look at:\\nHyatt House\\nHomewood Suites\\nResidence Inn\\nStaybridge Suites\\nEmbassy Suites\\nWe found that the Arthouse has some interesting suite configurations at a reasonable price in a great area. Radio City Apartments have one bedroom and two bedroom suites. The Affinia hotels are another option to look into. There are three in Manhattan.\\nEdited: 6:17 pm, May 23, 2021 The.

We have been to nyc plenty of times but never stayed around Greenwich and our next trip, we want to stay in the village but don’t know where to stay - our budget is $200-$250 per night - any help would be great!\\nWould love to be in the centre of things in restaurants and bars So you know, “Greenwich” is a city in Connecticut. “Greenwich Village” is where Washington Square Park is.\\nHave you looked into the Washington Square Hotel? It is very nice and is historic. Washington Square Hotel has been mentioned. It\\'s the closest one, if my memory serves me correctly.\\nThe Marlton is close too. This one has, as far as I can recall, fairly small rooms.\\nWalker Greenwich Village is within easy walking distance too.\\nThere are some hotels in East Village, a lovely area in itself. Moxy East Village and The Standard East Village comes to mind. You can walk to Washington Square Park from there. Check Google maps if they\\'re close enough for your liking. Lots of restaurants and bars in this area too.\\nEdited: 1:12 pm, May 23, 2021 Washington Square hotel is a good choice, It has rooms overlooking the park.\\nIf you look on the hotels official site, you can choose this room.\\nThe Marlton Hotel Also in Greenwich Village -from my research I’ve learned the rooms are quite small here. This hotel will be more expensive than the Washington Square hotel but depending on your dates it could work\\nhttps://marltonhotel.com/\\nEdited to add Cross posted with The intrepid Maxi.\\nEdited: 1:14 pm, May 23, 2021 Thanks a million for your active responses! Appreciate that\\nGo figure - my partner decided to drop that he stayed in the Washington park hotel before and didn’t like it .. SIGHHHH AND EVIL STARE!\\nIs there any other hotels that are worth looking at? Bar in the hotel preferable but not a deal breaker I\\'m thinking that both the Moxy and the Standard that I mentioned in my above post have very different looks than the Washington Squre Hotel. A new-er, more boutiqey feel imo. The Standard tends to be pricier though. About 10 minutes walk to the park. Pay attention to the layout of the bathroom in the Moxy, since you\\'re sharing a room\\nEdited: 1:26 pm, May 23, 2021 Thanks Maxi - just a side point, love the swedes! A great bunch!!\\nWe looked at the standard, seems nice! We have booked Moxy and Kixby - thats the style we like What are your exact dates of travel (hotel rates vary daily) & what is your desired bedding configuration? The location of the Kixby (near the Empire State. building ) does not put you in a great location for restaurants and bars. Which Moxy did you book? There are several now in NYC.\\nEdited: 1:04 am, May 24, 2021 The Mercer is not super far away... how about that?\\nhttp://www.mercerhotel.com Hi my husband and I are from New Jersey so we have been to NYC a few times already.\\nWe are in our early 40’s and For our 17 year anniversary we are going to do one night in New York City at the Marriott Marquis on August 7.\\nI have never been to central park so I’m interested in possibly going there and I would like to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Are either of these walking distance from our hotel?\\nIf not what’s the most convenient way to get there not necessarily cheapest way I’m looking for convenience and easy ? So if it’s not walkable I would assume Uber or taxi. Not interested in trying to figure out how to work the subway unless it really is easier then I’m thinking it would be.\\nAlso any recommendations for dinner nice but not over about $60 per person.\\nThank you in advance Depends on how much walking you are comfortable with, but it certainly is walkable. Its about a 15 minute walk to central park. Roughly a half hour to the MET which is on the eastern side of central park. Thank you for the response\\nThat is comfortable walking distance to me I guess depending on weather that day It,s possible to walk to the south end of Central Park. You can see the distance and time to walk on google maps.\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/3cydab79\\nYou could also take a taxi or Uber and go further north into the park. The Metropolitan Museum backs on to the east side of the park. Assuming you plan to do the park on one day and the museum on another (a better plan since both involve a lot of walking) taking a taxi or Uber from the hotel to the museum is a good idea, especially in August heat. They have been asking people to reserve in advance for the museum. If you can do the museum on a Sunday, early when they open is usually a good, less crowded time to go. In fact Sunday mornings tend to be less crowded everywhere.\\nAs for a dinner idea, if the $60/person is meant to include tax, tip and drinks, it,s not a lot by MYC standards, but certainly doable. Since choices are so varied, it would help to know what kind of foods you like (think about what you can\\'t or don,t get at home that you might like to try. A lot of ethnic cuisine is inexpensive Contents and Cichetti offer incredibly good value. Small charming local places in Greenwich village. http://cotenna.com/wp/ Oops. Just noticed autocorrect thought it knew the name of the restaurant better than I do. It’s Contenna. I feel the most \"scenic\" way to walk to Central Park from your hotel would be; Through Rock Center, then up 5th ave, then enter Central Park by the Plaza hotel, go past the Zoo & the clock, walk up the Mall to Bethesda fountain, go around the Loeb Boat House and up to Greywacke arch & then take a right towards the museum.\\nI also would suggest giving yourself a lot of time to enjoy the walk.\\nAlso, the Loeb Boat House would be an easy place to have lunch or an early dinner. Additionally renting a row boat at the boat house is suprisingly affordable.\\nIf, instead, you want to take an cab/uber from your hotel to another nieghborhood for dinner then I personally would recommend Gigino Wagner Park for dinner as it has a nice view of the Statue of Liberty.\\nWhatever you decide, Happy planning & (most importantly) Have Fun!\\nEdited: 9:56 am, May 23, 2021 Thank you all I think I would like ideas for Italian places to eat. I’m thinking we will walk to the sites and take an Uber back. We will be visiting NYC in early July for a few days before flying to Anguilla. I’m fully vaccinated but Anguilla requires that my 11 year old daughter (who is too young to be vaccinated) be given a pCR COVID test prior to our arrival. I don’t even know where to begin to look for this. Perhaps an urgent care or pharmacy? I’m hoping to secure an appointment before we arrive. Does anyone have any recommendations? We are staying in the Upper West Side, but happy to travel, of course. Thanks! Any CityMD location (you can check their website) offers free COVID testing. I looked at the CityMD websites and found nothing about free COVID PCR testing and also nothing regarding free services or costs of anything at all, but there were plenty of explanations about how to pay, where to pay and coverage by health insurance.\\nCan anyone tell us more? You need to submit your insurance information. “Free testing” is a bit of a misnomer because insurance actually pays. But they don’t require any co-pay as long as you have insurance. The CityMD PCR testing is for free, but takes 4-7 days.\\nI assume you need the test for a return trip, so check out some of the rapid PRC testing stations in the city I reserved tickets at both museums but I was wondering if we are allowed to leave to get lunch and come back or if we have to stay put there? I found this on the AMNH page:\\n\"\"*Eating is prohibited in Museum galleries. Because dining onsite is currently unavailable, visitors may leave and return using the same timed-entry on the same day.\"\"\\nhttps://www.amnh.org/plan-your-visit/code-of-conduct-2020?utm_source=order-confirmation&utm_medium=body\\nI\\'m not sure about the Met. That’s good to know. I know the met opened two cafes but I’d rather have the option to go elsewhere As far as I know, the Met gives you a sticker to wear that allows you entry into the galleries. The sticker is dated and should be good for the whole day. The Upper East Side is not the cheapest place to eat near the museum. \". The Upper East Side is not the cheapest place to eat near the museum.\" Yes it is not cheap immediately around the museum but simply walk 3-4 blocks across and you can find restaurant choices that are more reasonably priced in Yorkville. Timed tickets (they are free) are required from noon to 8 p.m. for entry to the park built on concrete pilings in the Hudson at W. 14th St. So if you are eager to visit soon, you may have to go at no-timed-ticket hours: before noon and after 8 p.m.:\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/first-look-little-island-nyc/?utm_source=TPG%20Curated%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2373776&utm_usr=9e594564580372016592cac97c9beb137cdcdbf814ce05cfdb43095b9c0df7f1&utm_msg=7b4a3faa49ca426281ac1a67b0e8de89&utm_date=2021-05-23 They\\'ve extended the times requiring reservations.\\nThey sent out an email: \"Starting today, May 22, we\\'re extending our timed entry reservation hours from 12 pm until 10 pm daily.\"\\nAccording to the website: \"timed entry reservations will be offered every half-hour starting at 12:00 through the remainder of the day.\"\\nhttps://littleisland.org/timed-entry-reservations I\\'ll be in New York Memorial Day weekend. I\\'ll also be taking my son to Nickelodeon Universe in Jersey. Is it best to rent a car or use Lyft or Uber? Trying to be time efficient and economical. Where exactly in NYC are you starting from? https://www.americandream.com/transportation#\\nCan\\'t see how renting a car would be a good idea and a lyft from NYC would be rather pricey. Suggest you look at public transportation. Maybe a ferry/short lyft ride Like time Square area. The link is #2 has all the information you need. Either take a train from Penn Station to Secaucus Junction and then car service or take a bus from the Port Authority.\\nRenting a car is not a wise choice. The distance from time Square to the park in Jersey was not too far. Like 10 minute so I was thinking a Lyft would be cool. All other activities, eating site seeing in New York I thought an Lyft would be cool too or not? Going with a friend and she rented a car. After talking to others who\\'ve been to NYC it doesn\\'t sound like a car is a good idea. But she still wants to rent it. I have a reservation for a car but really thinking of ditching that idea. Just checked lyft estimates and it was like $80. Strongly recommend looking at transit. Ferry seems pretty fast with a cheap lyft ride from ferry drop off point. Depending what time you go, you could have terrible traffic in and out of the Lincoln Tunnel. Some people don\\'t mind traffic, some people go nuts with it. Plus, the signage when you get out of the tunnel is sort of designed for people who already know where they\\'re going, you may find it confusing. (If you\\'re in the wrong lane coming out of the tunnel, you need to cut across a few lanes really quickly, plus, GPS says things like \"stay right then go left...\" It helps if you know where you\\'re going in advance, I grew up driving those roads and laugh over what the WAZE instructions are.)\\nIf it were me, I would take a ferry to a Lyft, or the train to a Lyft. Bus to a second bus is not fun, especially if your connections don\\'t work.\\nWith two of you who would have to pay train/bus fares anyhow, if you don\\'t mind the additional expense, go ahead, take a Lyft. It\\'s vacation, do what\\'s easy for you. You won\\'t need a car in the city that is for sure. There is no TIME Square in NYC.\\nThere is a Times Square, the name is based on the newspaper.\\nTaking Public Transport doesn\\'t seem too difficult with direct buses from Port Authority (according to google maps).\\nFar far far cheaper too.\\nM You cannot park a car in Manhattan (except on Sundays) on the Street (and even then its limited and not for the faint hearted) , they do not ticket they TOW. Parking lots cost between $20-$50 (depending on location and events in the city, when there is an event parking costs more, pricing is dynamic)\\nAlso the Lincoln Tunnel (Or the Holland Tunnel) is a $12 toll After our circle line tour of NYC I would like to go for coffee and great desserts. We will be staying in midtown but leaving the piers near the Intrepid. Don\\'t care how far it is...we can uber....just want a great dessert\\nAnd, we want to be able to sit at a table\\nEdited: 1:42 pm, May 16, 2021 Do you have specific preferences for type of coffee and / or desserts? No preferences\\nDo love German and austrian food but we are ok with recommendations Bibble & Sip on 51 st at 8 avenue\\nhttps://www.bibbleandsip.com/ Any interest in Hudson Yard and the High Line afterwards?\\nI mention this because I frequent LaBergamote on 9th Ave in Chelsea and they have great pastries. I have not tried their coffee, but they have numerous tea options, so I would assume they have coffee as well.\\nhttps://www.labergamotenyc.com\\nYou could easily walk from the Intrepid to Hudson yards, then the High Line, something like this:\\nhttps://goo.gl/maps/ZMxrH8JZDnwbtL9r5\\nThey also have a location in midtown west which would work, it really depends on what you\\'re doing afterwards and which direction you\\'re going. There are also many other places as well, it might help to know better where you\\'re going after the dessert break. I had thought about Eataly as well (Flatirn)..........can we get sit down dessert and coffee there or is everything to go? We are looking at possibly going to the NY Historical Museum after this, if that helps Alice\\'s Tea Cup on Upper West Side. Don\\'t know what their coffees are like but they\\'re good for pastries anyhow. It\\'s within walking distance of the New York Historical Society.\\nEdited: 2:25 pm, May 16, 2021 Ferrara’s Bakery & Cafe on Grand Street in ‘Little Italy’ — Coffees Espressos and Cappuccino, Italian pastries, cannoli, cookies, gelato and cakes by the slice ... Prosecco, Sambuca, Campari, wine or maybe even a cocktail! If you don\\'t go to a place like Alice\\'s Tea Cup, on UWS near the museum, then I suggest staying on the far west side near the pier. A couple years ago I had coffee and something sweet and delicious on W 42 near maybe 11th, but for the life of me can\\'t remember name of place or exact location. For the best specifically Austrian pastries & coffee, check out Cafe Sabarsky on 5th Ave.\\nNote this place is in the Neue Gallery which is closed until 6/10.\\nEdited: 5:46 pm, May 16, 2021 I will be visiting NYC with my wife next month for our anniversary and I was looking for a good place to eat for our anniversary dinner. My preferences are a dinner with multiple courses or a tasting menu with several items (doesn\\'t have to be if it\\'s a good place with an a la carte menu). I should also mention my wife and I don\\'t like fish too much. Anywhere with a nice view or just a beautiful dining area is a bonus. My budget is $150 per person before tax and drinks.\\nCan you help me out with some recommendations? Rivercafe.com\\nhas been one of my favorite special occasion places with a great view of the East River and Manhattan skyline, very good food and nice service. It\\'s $155/person for 3 courses.\\nTemple Court on Ten at the top of the Beekman hotel is another option but their 3 course dinner menu is somewhat limited.\\nhttps://www.templecourtnyc.com/menus-temple-court/\\nBoth of these are only serving Wed-Sunday. Many restaurants have menus with \"small plates\" that encourage ordering multiple items to share, which allows you to create your own \"tasting menu.\" If you like Indian food, a new upscale restaurant called Sona has lots of delicious smaller plates. Wayan also has lots of small plates to choose from.\\nLlama San also has small plates but also has a set 3 course menu.\\nLe Coucou is \"temporarily closed,\" unfortunately, that would be great for you. I would keep checking for when they re-open. Same with The Grill.\\nGramercy Tavern may appeal to you, the food is stellar.\\nWhile some of the big name restaurants have \"temporarily closed,\" there are still thousands of great restaurants. If you are amenable to creating your own \"tasting menu\" (and can mention food preferences, you will get more suggestions. Risa\\'s suggestion about sharing some smaller plates could be a great idea.\\nI tend to enjoy tasting menus a lot, in a creative restaurant - there are many in NYC - this can be fun and I have got to try things I\\'ve enjoyed a lot that I would never have thought about ordering myself a la carte. The drawback could be that it is quite likely that at least one dish is fish which you prefer less. So someplace where you can pick and choose a bit might work really well. So many good places!\\nManhatta has great views, I haven\\'t been though since I thought their menu was a bit too limited for my taste, but you could check to see if it fits your tastes - since it ticks the \\'view\\' box.\\nThe following won\\'t tick the view box:\\nBoulud Sud is one of my favorites, and they used to have a really varied menu and a high level of service. Don\\'t know if they have reopened yet or not? It\\'s from the same chef, David Boulud, whose signature restaurant David has 2* (it\\'s a great option since they have or at least used to have an option where you could pick a certain number of dishes for the table but everyone could within that course limit pick their own dishes). The latter is probably above budget though, it\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve been.\\nABC Cocina if you like Mexican flavors. Typically very creative dishes. Unfortunately, Manhatta is still closed. While I think the restaurant \"scene\" is thriving in what is the \"middle market\"* in NYC, for some, the Covid restrictions have been unworkable. I expect that these will re-open soon, but depending on the deals they\\'ve made with their landlords, or their various loans, or other external considerations, it may not be until fall for some of the high end restaurants that are \"temporarily closed.\"\\n*What is high end in other parts of the country is sort of normal in Manhattan. A $100pp bill (including tax and tip) is fairly normal. There are hundreds of restaurants that are open in that $15-25 for \"small plate\", $25-40/entree price range. For a very romantic vibe, Frenchette could be a good choice but that has no view or tasting menu\\'s. The tables in the back room are very nice.\\nThey used to have big vases of flowers and candles and low lighting. Not sure about now. Whiz ..you mention the River Cafe ...will never forget our Christmas lunch with you and Mr Whiz ....fabulous food, great service and that view....and YOU.\\nIf I ever get to travel OS again and return to NYC I will try to organise a TA Forum catch up in the bar there...maybe on their gorgeous deck if I return in the warmer months. - For our anniversary we have had the tasting menu at Amma - many a time. Enjoyable every time: AMMA https://www.ammanyc.com/\\n- For a restaurant that does not have tasting menu. But, we found romantic and cozy; located in a townhouse: Jojo https://www.jojorestaurantnyc.com/ Hello all,\\nWe need to drop off our 12 year old at a summer camp in upstate NY in July. But would like to do a family trip around there for a week. I was thinking of flying into Washington DC, then go to Manhattan, then Boston and then drive to Camp. But that doesn\\'t seem that exciting. It is so predictable.\\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to how we can make this trip a bit more fun for 9 and 12 year olds?\\nWe live in Los Angeles. Can you say a bit more about what your kids like? If you fly into Dulles, for example, you\\'re right next to the air and space museum Annex which includes a space shuttle. Would that be of interest? If you have 7 days total I\\'d only do two of those cities. Fly into NYC, drive to Boston, then out to camp. Otherwise you\\'re not going to have time to see much in any of the cities.\\nOr skip the cities entirely and do a beach and an amusement park and a couple Hall of Fames, if you are into that. We have already been to NYC, but the kids have never been to Washington or Boston. We don’t know the area at all. Which beaches or parks would you recommend there? Thank you. The kids have seen lots of that here is Los Angeles. So maybe not? 🤷🏻\\u200d♀️ Without knowing what they would find fun or their interests, it,s hard to respond. 3 cities in a week sounds too much to me. You might want to post on the roadtrip forum. Agreed that those 3 cities would be a bit much for a week\\'s visit.\\n\"But that doesn\\'t seem that exciting. It is so predictable.\"\\nWhat are the kids and your interests, that would make the trip exciting and non-predictable? Get the kids involved and have them do some research. You mentioned beaches and parks, sounds like a road trip is in order.\\nMaybe skip Washington DC and focus on NY and MA. Take in some city sights, but hit the road and take in those beaches and parks. I live just outside DC & love it here. But - I get out of town for the summer. Given the timing of your trip, I agree that NYC & Boston would be a good combination. Post of the Boston forum for sure, but look at possible whale watching cruises, or heading out to an island in Boston Harbor.... I would probably fly into Boston and concentrate on Massachusetts and NY State. Lots to see in Boston (including the incredible Museum of Science), the Freedom Trail, Plimouth Plantation, a Boston Red Sox game at Fenway. Heading west, if you have sports fans you can stop at the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield. Jiminy Peak, the ski area in western Massachusetts, has all kinds of summer mountain activities, including a ropes course and mountain coaster.\\nCooperstown and the Baseball Hall of Fame was another great suggestion, as well as Howes Caverns that is not too far away. If the camp is in the Adirondacks, there is a lot of kid-friendly activities in that area during the summer too.\\nI agree that I would not visit Washington in the heat of summer. Where in upstate New York? New York state is rather large. I agree with others that doing these three cities in one week is not really feasible. Since you have already been to NYC I would skip it. While DC is a good destination for children of that age I would advise skipping it as well, since it does not pair well with Boston in your limited time.\\nInstead I would fly to Boston and spend the week touring Boston, Mass, and parts of upstate NY. Maybe head up to Cape Ann. Check out sturbridge village. If they are fans of basketball then you can hit the basketball hall of fame in Springfield. If they like baseball there is the baseball hall of fame that was mentioned above. If some of this stuff is not appealing you could look at heading up to Arcadia National park in Maine. There are many options for kids all over the region and it will really depend on the particular interests of the family.\\nEdited: 3:33 pm, May 18, 2021 When it opens in October, the Summit observation deck in One Vanderbilt will be competing with those in the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Hudson Yards, and One World Trade Center, And there\\'s yet another forthcoming deck: It will be in the Chrysler Building.\\nhttps://thepointsguy.com/news/summit-one-vanderbilt-observation-deck/?utm_source=TPG%20Daily%20Newsletter&utm_campaign=&utm_usr=&utm_msg=&utm_date=2021-05-20&utm_medium=email\\nhttps://summitov.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=reimagineprelaunch&utm_content=ad3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkZiFBhD9ARIsAGxFX8Cfy6B3Vx3KNgBEFweXettB9GuWtxXiNaEZf4gNMqh\\nhttps://ny.curbed.com/2020/5/20/21264740/chrysler-building-new-observation-deck They all sort of are similar, I would recommend Top of the Rock over the rest. the reason there are so many of them is because its very profitable. The Empire State Building is a public corporation and their finances are public. In their financial Statement they state they make more money from the Observation Deck than they do for all the rent collected in the rest of the Building They are on opposite sides of GCT, which makes them handy for folks who are staying near GCT and can\\'t get to one of the other ones.\\nAlso the One Vanderbilt one has \"immersive\" experiences like a see through floor that may help you better understand what it would be like to fall down on Madison Avenue from that height. They also have food by Danny Meyer\\'s group, which would be a plus for me if I were inclined to hang out at observation decks.\\nThe Chrysler one sounds like it involves a rebirth of something that used to be there -- the Cloud Club. It\\'s also a way to get into that building, which is otherwise difficult to do unless you have business there.\\nNow, if they would just revive the Copter Club on the former Pan Am building, scene of one of the great NY disasters of the 70s, and offer a viewing platform pass to all three, 42d St might have a new claim to fame. Grandrue, was that the private club on top of the PanAm/MetLife Building? I was there a few times a long time ago. Great views, but I remember thinking the best part about it was that it’s the only building where you have zero chance of seeing the monstrosity that is the PanAm building. Something to add to my next trip. Empire State - Check\\nTop of the Rock - Check\\nOne World Observatory - Check\\nOne Vanderbilt - On the list.\\nIt opens just before I (hopefully), land in NYC for what is my (i think). 30th trip to NYC in 20 years. (i honestly have lost count).\\nM #3. Yes, that was the Copter Club, which was also used as a lounge for Pan Am copter passengers. The Cloud Club, a two or three level place in the Chrysler Building, was either a private club or just a very exclusive hangout in the 30s. I understand one if its early regulars was Juan Trippe, founder of Pan Am, so I suppose the idea for the Copter Club may have been influenced by his experience at the Cloud Club. http://gothamist-client.prod.nypr.digital/news/in-1977-five-were-killed-in-helicopter-accident-atop-midtowns-pan-am-building\\nThis article has a photo of the roof of the Pan Am building following the 1977 incident that killed 5. You can see the top of the Chrysler building looming over it in the background. I don\\'t think the Cloud Club survived until 1977, but if it had its members might have had quite a view of this.\\nEdited: 6:09 pm, May 20, 2021 There was previously an \"observation deck\" of sorts at the roof garden of the Amsterdam Theatre on 42nd St. This was a glass walkway where the showgirls would cavort and men would pay extra for tables underneath. The Vanderbilt deck is supposed to be the highest in MIdtown, though it is likely it will be surpassed in the not distant future. The higher you go, the windier it gets making outdoor spaces impractical at a point. Grand Central has its famous glass walkways in its large windows, but these are no longer open to the public. Pan Am!\\nI flew that airline a few times many years ago.\\nI collect unique luggage tags. I must have 35 on my main carry on bag. Several years ago, there was a Flight 001 store up the block from my home. When they were closing down, they had sales on everything. I scored some very cool/vintage like PanAm luggage tags.\\nI always get comments on them when I am waiting to exit a plane. Good morning ,\\nI am driving through New York City this summer on my way to Maine with my family (3 teenage sons ). We are planning on spending about 1-2 days in the NYC- not a lot of time but wanted to see a few things. Any thoughts on:\\n1. Worth going to a Mets game?\\n2. Best Statue of Liberty/Ellis island Tour?\\n3 . To see 9/11 is it with buying a package your deal or just gonna on own ?\\nAny information is greatly appreciated .\\nThanks ;) Also, teenage sons very into sneakers. Are there any cool sneaker stores? 1. \"Worth it\" questions are best decided amongst yourselves - ask your sons if they want to go to a Mets game.\\n2. Boats from statuecruises.com is the only way to get onto Liberty Island/Ellis Island\\n3. You can walk around the memorials for free and there are people around that you can talk to/ask questions of. The museum requires a timed ticket but you don\\'t need a guide in my opinion. If you like baseball its worth going to a Mets game, if You hate baseball than no.. There are MANY cool sneaker stores in Soho. Many of them have lines to get into when they drop new merchandise. Some of them are quite expensive. (I never understood the allure of $500 sneakers). I would plan some time for shopping and walking around the stores in Soho.\\nTotally agree that no one can decide what is “worth it” to YOU. Citifield is a nice stadium.\\nEdited: 12:02 pm, May 20, 2021 Citifield is nice. Not as nice as PNC Park, which is among the very best of the newer stadiums, so you may be spoiled by your local venue. If the schedule appeals to you, you\\'ll have fun at Citifield. https://flightclub.com/\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d2277004-Reviews-Flight_Club-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThis store is a must for a sneakerhead : Flight Club @ 812 Broadway near Union Square Park, Manhattan. If you like baseball, then go to a game, you have two local teams, but it depends on if they\\'re playing at home while you\\'re here.\\nStatue Cruises is the official vendor for the Statue of Liberty, do not buy from anywhere else:\\nhttps://www.cityexperiences.com/new-york/city-cruises/statue/statue-liberty-and-ellis-island-tickets/\\nThe 9/11 Museum is self guided, I do not believe a tour is needed. The Museum is emotionally intense and deserves 3 hours or so. The 9/11 Memorial is an outdoor plaza with waterfalls where the two towers stood. You can walk around and reflect, but also self guided. I agree with everyone who said that if the family wants to go to a Mets game, go. No one on this board can advise if it is \"worth\" it...and I\\'m a HUGE Mets fan.\\nSneakers? There are so many...but I will mention a few in the city.\\n-Flight Club has been mentioned.\\n-Extra Butter(Orchard St.)\\n-Kith\\n-Some of the major department stores have solid selections: Nordstron on 57th, Saks. and both Bloomingdales(Lex and SOHO) come to mind.\\n-There are several Foot Locker stores in the city. The one on 34th Street isn\\'t bad. I used to live within walking distance of Yankee Stadium and now within walking distance of Citi Field and have yet to set foot in either---baseball is not my thing. However, there are thousands who would disagree with me. From what I gather, the Mets have the nicer venue. There are promotions at some Mets games with bobbleheads of players and other trinkets. Occasionally, there are fireworks nights that I can enjoy from Flushing after the game. You might want to check the dates if any of these are happening. Citi Field can be easily reached by the #7 train towards Flushing in about 30 mins. from Grand Central. The LIRR Port Washington trains stop at the stadium taking about 20 mins. from Penn Station. These are less frequent and more expensive than the subway and little is actually gained time-wise unless you need to get to Penn Station. The #7 train is elevated in Queens and provides some interesting views, especially near Manhattan. There is parking at Citi Field, but I cannot comment on availability or cost.\\nThis website might help you with sneakers. I am aware of limited editions of models that are very costly.\\nhttps://www.highsnobiety.com/p/sneaker-stores-new-york-city/ The Adidas Originals store and the \"regular\" Adidas stores would be worth a visit if you had more time. Hello Everyone!\\nI have plans to be in Manhattan in about 10 days and was planning to use the subway to get around. Several friends have strongly tried to dissuade me from that idea. I am a senior lady, will be traveling alone, and will be there for a week staying in a hotel near Times Square. I have no mobility problems but don\\'t think I\\'m in good enough shape to walk miles & miles day in & day out. I\\'d like to get some feedback from people moving around the city right now. Thanks! Use the subway. I ride it daily and see people of all ages right by my side.\\nLoad up your Metrocard and enjoy NYC! The hardest part of the subway is the stairs - I can walk five miles around the city all day and have no problems, but a flight of subway stairs can leave me winded sometimes, especially if you\\'re not used to it (I\\'m out of practice after not using the subway most of this year). I\\'m sure you can manage on the subway, but give yourself time when you go up the stairs when exiting.\\nI agree, people of all ages take the subway all of the time. Don\\'t be distracted by people rushing by.\\nSince a picture is worth a thousand words, I\\'ll say that yours leads me to believe that you can handle the subway. Last Saturday at the Union Sq station.......an older woman started wheeling her shopping cart down the stairs. I happen to be standing right at the bottom. I walked up, grabbed the cart...which was heavier than I expected...and carried it down for her.\\nShe thanked me and went on her way...as did I. Happens every day. She didn\\'t have a care in the world and probably does this several times a week.\\nOk..she is a local and probably has been riding the subway for many years. But there is no reason that you can\\'t do the same. Ask for directions if you are unsure. Be confident...you see a seat...go for it! Getting off and the car is full car? Say...EXCUSE ME!\\nThe subway is a NYC experience and you will be a pro after 10 days! “Several friends have strongly tried to dissuade me from that idea”\\nWhat are your friends reasons for strongly trying to dissuade you?\\nKnowing this may help locals to answer this question more thoroughly. Subway is fine. especially during the day. Plenty of people using it, but still you should be able to find a seat outside of peak times. If you have issues with balance just hold the rails on the steps. I took several different train rides this week alone.\\nEdited: 9:54 pm, May 07, 2021 I will be honest, I have not been on the Subway Since Feb 2020 and have no plans to take it any time soon.\\nI have been on a Bus and Commuter train once since then\\nNormally I wouldnt have a problem with the Subway Subway crime has been at the top of the news cycle here for some time. There have been numerous unprovoked attacks and many people do not feel safe, see this recent rider survey:\\nhttps://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/04/13/mta-survey-finds-subway-riders-feeling-less-safe-from-upticks-in-crime-not-covid-19-violations\\nThere have been numerous battles going on between the governor and the mayor, the governor made some comments about not letting his daughter ride the subway.\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/05/03/cuomo-not-telling-my-child-to-ride-the-subway-in-slamming-mta-safety/\\nI think it\\'s important to know what\\'s going on so that you can be aware.\\nMy best advice, try for yourself. I would recommend taking a subway trip to your first destination that you have in mind, see how you feel. That\\'s really the best test. Keep your belongs close to you, watch your back, and just mind your own business. While I dont usually agree with Soringer, I have not taken the subway because of the homeless and the crime. I was in a station once in Jamaica, usually a very busy station and I saw more homeless than passengers.\\nOP should take a bus for now To answer #4 question as to the reasons my friends give me ... they are many.\\nI am old: I will be alone; It is dangerous; There is danger of catching Covid; There is danger of being mugged; There are too many stairs; They are empty; They are crowded; They are dirty; It\\'s not business as usual ... yadda, yadda, yadda ... You get the drift.\\nThanks to those who have taken the time to post some great answers; informative, funny & reasuring. I\\'m feeling a bit more confident, Although, I\\'d like to get a few more answers ... and find out why Howard has no plans to ride any time soon ... I agree that the only reason to avoid the subway is the stairs. This is a lonshot !! We got to Macys before opening time so went for a walk around the area and found a coffee shop, it sold the best coffee i had ever tasted!! I dont remember where it was or what its called, all i remember is they served tje coffee in bowls Anyone have any likely candidates? Thanks. The only place I can think of in midtown that served coffee in bowls was Le Pain Quotidien BUT the nearest location to Macy,s was actually across from Bryant Park on 40th st. & 6th Ave. More importantly, the chain declared bankruptcy and most locations have closed (although another co. Has bought them Nd will reopen some). If you were served coffee in a bowl, you were in a French-style cafe. Maybe the quite good Maison Kayser, 3 blocks up Broadway from Macy\\'s at 38th St. and other locations in NYC. But it too closed in bankruptcy. According to news reports, some Maison Kaysers may also reopen as Le Pain Quotidiens This is from a TV show, it is set in DC but filmed mostly in the Brooklyn NY area. It looks like a beautiful place to go for a walk or bike ride next time I take the train up there. I was thinking it looks like the underside of a larger arch bridge spanning a river, but that\\'s only my best guess.\\nSorry you\\'ll have to click the link because we can\\'t post images here.

I believe it also appeared in the \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" film as well. The bridge was constructed as part of the original Penn Station project that allowed PRR trains to reach areas to the north by using tunnels under the East River, then the bridge from Queens to the Bronx. The bridge crossed a notorious patch of water that once had slightly submerged rock ledges and still strong currents because of the 3+ hour difference in the tide between Long Island Sound and the East Side in Manhattan. The Hell Gate originally carried 4 tracks, two for passengers and two for freight, but two were removed with the decline of the Brooklyn docks. It is still considered the strongest major bridge span in the world.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58jLwiBYI20 It\\'s underneath the railroad viaduct for the Hell Gate bridge https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Gate_Bridge used by Amtrak and some freight trains (The viaducts for the road traffic that cross the island via the Triboro/RFK bridge is adjacent, newer and less photogenic)\\nRandall\\'s Island is a park with a variety of facilities / activities https://randallsisland.org/\\nI\\'ve seen it used in a variety of TV shows (Blue Bloods, the various Law & Orders, etc.)\\nEdited: 6:57 am, May 21, 2021 You can also see it in Astoria Park\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPIe8gkN2DC/\\nThere is a bike Path in Astoria Park, just not right under the Bridge (Its called the Hellgate Bridge) There is now a Citibike station by the Icahn stadium on Randall\\'s Island https://www.citibikenyc.com/\\nYou can access the island by bus from Manhattan (M35 from 125th street) or by foot via bridges from Manhattan or Queens (and I think the Bronx). The walkway over the Triboro has stairs. Not sure about the other ones\\nEdited: 7:35 am, May 21, 2021 I’ve never visited the big apple before. Our hotel will be in Newark shut s short walk from the Newark Penn station. Will we be able to get to places like top of the rock, Times Square, and Central Park from that terminal? Will the subway rides be long from there to Manhattan? Will the subway be expensive for a family of five? Where can I go to get the most current public transit routes and schedule?\\nOne more question. Which entrance is best at Central Park to be closest to good portrait background spots? I’m a photographer and plan to take some pictures of my family there. I would not stay in the area near Newark Penn Station, Even at the Hilton there, Trust me on this one.\\nIts not hard to get to NYC from there, but Newark is kind of Sketchy Trains from Newark Penn Station bring you to New York Penn Station, which is where you get the subway or bus. Some destinations may require a transfer.NY City Transit publishes a free subway map, which you can get for free at major transit hubs. I assume it is also available online. They also publish separate bus maps for each of the 5 boroughs, including Manhattan. Is there a reason you are staying in Newark when it seems like you want to spend your time in Manhattan? The NYC subway system does not go to New Jersey https://new.mta.info/maps\\nFrom Newark you must either take an NJ Transit train or a PATH train into Manhattan\\nThen either walk or take the subway wherever you want to go\\nEdited: 6:19 pm, May 18, 2021 I got the closet hotel that would allow me to fit a family of 5 with my points redemption. It’s only for 3 nights. I don’t mind getting on the train at Newark Penn Station and then getting on another train in Penn Station. It’s just for 3 days then we head up to Niagara. So really we’re planning to leave the hotel 3 times for 3 trips to NYC. I am not an expert on this, but if a PATH station is near the hotel, check to see what it costs these days, as it could be a bit less than the train. I\\'m not too sure I would feel very comfortable riding PATH later at night, but I\\'m not a regular rider.\\nBoth Amtrak and NJ Transit stop at Newark Penn Station. I don\\'t know if Amtrak even allows people to get on for the short journey to NY Penn, but if they do it likely costs more, so if you do use the train I suggest taking one of the NJ Transit trains, of which there are many. Make sure to do the math on how much it will cost to commute back and forth to/from NJ, which will be on top of what it costs per ride on the NYC transit system and the travel time involved. Getting from Newark Penn Station to Manhattan isnt a big deal, the problem is newark isnt a good area , and the area around the train station is an area I would avoid , especially at night, ive been there a few times and there are very sketcky people there What brand do you have points with? Surely we could help you find something better. Staying in Manhattan will enhance the trip immeasurably.\\nI full agree about not staying in Newark, you pay for what you get. First Question:\\nMy flight got changed for my departure and I\\'ll have to be at the JFK no later than 6:15am (little over 2 hours before my flight). Originally it was at 11:30am and that gave me lots of time.\\nWith this new time, my hotel is in Chinatown near Grand St Stn & Bowery Stn. I know the J is supposed to be pretty slow and that early in the morning (5am or earlier) it might not be the best to ride with my backpack.\\nWould the E Train be fine that early (since I will already be on it regardless) or would it just be better getting off the E Train at Penn Station and taking the LIRR to the Air Trans at Jamaica?\\nSecond question:\\nPlanning on changing trains and seeing parts of The Evergreens Cemetery on my way to Rockaway Beach.\\nI know all about Broadway Junction and it\\'s reputation, but in the daytime in 2021 (as I know crime has increased during Covid) is Broadway Junction (despite having the Transit police Station there) in and out of the station and going to The Evergreens still not advisable, or would it be generally fine in the day?\\nSame with switching to the S at Broad Channel Stn in the day? I assume all the fear of these two areas and stations is generally for the night and may be very much over exaggerated, but just wanting some good local knowledge opinions? Most people who ride the Subway early in the Morning (after 6am) are just workers, I wouldn\\'t worry about it that much.\\nI would say the E and J would be the same as far as crime, I live near the E train and honestly I have not taken the Subway since Feb 2020.\\nBroad Channel is very Safe, Its one of the safest Parts of the Subway, If you are worried about the Subway take the Ferry to Rockaway Beach, Its a very nice ride I can\\'t really answer the first question, as I have no experience taking the E to JFK. My main hesitation in taking the train (in my case, it would be the A) would be service issues, not fear of crime. A flight that early is one of the few times I\\'d lean toward taking a cab or car service.\\nAs for your question about Evergreens Cemetery . . . I\\'ve never visited the cemetery itself, but I do go to nearby Highland Park and the Ridgewood Reservoir, which has me transferring to the J at Broadway Junction and going another stop or two, to either Van Siclen or Cleveland. It\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve been there, but I\\'d have no qualms walking from either of those two stations (in fact, once you hit the hill that goes up to the park, it\\'s very pretty, with big, beautiful houses). So if you don\\'t mind walking - and I know from your posts that you\\'re a big walker! - that would be an option to consider, even though it\\'s farther from the cemetery than Broadway Junction (I confess, I don\\'t know where the cemetery entrances are, exactly, or if access is limited, as it is in some cemeteries).\\nThat said, it\\'s not as though the area around Broadway Junction is a war zone or anything. I wouldn\\'t hang out there aimlessly at night, but if it were the best station for me to get to where I needed to go, I wouldn\\'t hesitate to use it. (I\\'d definitely walk quickly and purposefully, though.) Under Normal Circumstances the E train is Packed during the Morning Rush hour, there might not be room for your luggage on it OP is talking about taking the E train and being at JFK by 6:15am so there is really no chance of them being in a packed train as they won\\'t be on it during rush hour. With a flight on the line I wouldn\\'t be relying on subway service before 6am. The overnight service can be drastically reduced in frequency and you never know what delays could pop up. Better to take LIRR because it has a set schedule and is less prone to delays. there are alot of people who have to be at work early 6am is Rush Hour on the E train Coming from Manhattan before 6am is rush hour on the E train? I don\\'t really take trains that early but I have certainly been on the E many times a little bit later at like 7:30-8am going from Manhattan towards Queens and the train was not at all crowded. Pretty sure any rush hour traffic is going the other direction during the morning. Thanks, for the airport I just figured since I would be already on the E, if I should just take it all the way to Jamaica without having to get off at Penn, and then on to the LIRR. However, looking at the schedules and such, the LIRR seems to be very frequent and as mentioned might just be easier to deal with for luggage and such. I\\'ll just maybe just do that then.\\nBroad Channel Station: Good to know @howardform, just read it seems to be a favorite of one of the most crime ridden stations and was just curious how bad it could be as it just seems pretty small. I\\'ll be taking the Q35 bus back anyways, I\\'m used to crime ridden areas, but just wasn\\'t sure about all the hype over this one station.\\nBroadway Junction: Thanks again @ Liinda E for your great inputs and especially around Van Siclen and Cleveland St. Just too bad the J doesn\\'t connect to the A on my way to Rockaway at all in that area other than Broadway Jct. And as I\\'ve probably mentioned before, I\\'ve walked around far too many bad areas in cities around the world for decades (used to spend years wandering the streets of Detroit in the late 80\\'s and early 90\\'s) not to mention some dangerous areas in other countries, so I guess this wouldn\\'t be anything unusual for me. I was more thinking I guess with reports that crime was starting to get out of control again during Covid and there was a lack of MTA Police presence compared to before and such. The cemetery is close to the station so as long as you know exactly where you are going and don\\'t start wandering aimlessly through the area then it seems more of a matter of your risk tolerance. A lot of the incidents I hear about from there involve people who could have avoided the situation if they only kept moving instead of getting in arguments with other people. Would never recommend the area to people at night though and even during the daytime things still happen just with less frequency. I cant Belive Broad Channel is Dangerous, you must have it confused with somewhere else, Its like a Fishing Villlage in the Middle of Queens, hardly anyone goes there (Because of its remoteness, not because of safety) People who live there sort of don\\'t live, generations live there. If you want to experience Old timer New Yorkers, Go there Broad Channel Station has some crime issues. It doesn\\'t really have to do with the area around it though. It is because the station is a transfer point. Lot of the crime going on doesn\\'t even start in the station. It happens on the trains and people jump off at the station. Hello,\\nMy 17 year old and I are flying into Newark the afternoon of May 21. Planning to stay near Lincoln Center on Friday night, hopefully have a night out in the city as well as see Fordham\\'s Lincoln campus Friday night and Saturday. Then head to the Bronx to see the Rose Hill campus. We are leaving Rose Hill the afternoon of the 24th to drive up to Syracuse.\\nFull disclosure: Kid wants Rose Hill for his University and college experience. Would like the visit to reflect that reality that he would live, if possible.\\nMy questions:\\nIdeally we need to say in a place with two beds. 17 year old son doesn\\'t really want to share a bed with mom. Affordable Air BNBs seem to only be studios (of course). Looks like Hell\\'s Kitchen is a good walking distance to Lincoln Center, and good food options. Sound like a good bet? If so, and affordable boutique hotels to recommend? Also open to other neighborhood suggestions as well as larger hotels if anyone has good recommendations. This is a non-planned trip so hoping to keep our lodging reasonable. $150-$200/ night (MAX)\\nDitto on The Bronx for places to stay. However, looks like most places to stay are a fairly good distance from the Rose Hill campus. Am I researching wrong? Any suggestions greatly appreciated.\\nIs there a good area with car rental options in The Bronx? Or should we head out to La Guardia?\\nFinally, It\\'s been years since I\\'ve been to NYC and we are really really looking forward to some good food. Zero experience in the Bronx. Any recommendations, especially near campus? Some info here from a recent thread:\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13522784-Around_Fordham_Campus-New_York_City_New_York.html#replies Most AirBnB style rentals are illegal\\nThere is a Fordham station on the Metro North commuter trains http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/mnrmap.htm You might be able to take a train to a town with a hotel and a car rental agency - perhaps White Plains (which I think has both) \" Would like the visit to reflect that reality that he would live, if possible.\" Is he planning on living on campus? If so, you aren\\'t going to be able to reflect that reality. You will get a decent idea of Lincoln Center because it is an urban campus where the dorms are basically apartments. Rose Hill is a completely different experience. There is absolutely no reason to stay in the Bronx, because living on campus is nothing like living off-campus in the bronx. Just stay in Manhattan and take the metro north train up to Fordham from grand central. It is a 20 minute ride and the station is right next to one of the entrances to the campus.\\nDirectly across from the Rose Hill campus is the NY Botanical Gardens. Also, extremely close by is the Bronx Zoo. For food in that area of the Bronx Little, Italy is a few blocks away and is where most the students will go for their shopping, eating and night life if they don\\'t want to head into the city. Not sure what is happening with the pandemic but there is an intercampus transit system. If you are staying near the lincoln center campus I would ask if you are able to use their transit system. They usually have vans that go back and forth between the campuses for students and staff and they may grant you access. The Fordham “campus” at Lincoln Center is basically two city blocks. It will take ten minutes to see from the outside. Are you able to go into classes? Are you meeting someone there who will take you into the buildings?\\nIt is exactly across the street from Lincoln Center. You can go see the Fountain, or if tours have started again, perhaps you want a tour of Lincoln center, if you’re interested. Some restaurants around that neighborhood are fun, maybe Rosa Mexicana or Cafe Fiorello.\\nI believe there is a shuttle that runs between the two campuses but you may want to check if it’s running now, and if it’s available to you or only matriculated students.\\nDepending on what else you want to do, I don’t know if changing hotels makes sense. It depends on what else you want to do in NYC. So you\\'re planning to drive up to Syracuse on Monday the 24th or Tuesday the 25th?\\nI agree staying in Manhattan would be more fun, but a possible reason to stay north of the city is to avoid some traffic on the way north.\\nWhite Plains (or Tarrytown ) is a good place to cross the Hudson river and head that direction\\nEdited: 10:01 pm, May 11, 2021 They are going to have to deal with the traffic one way or another. Best to just spend as much time as possible in the city to get a feel for it. Yes, heading to Syracuse on the 24th. What about staying in Harlem? Any thoughts on that? Looks like a nice in between / a bit further north. Risa - Thank you this is helpful and hadn\\'t thought about that. It definitely makes more sense to stay in the city. Any thoughts on staying in Harlem? Just stay one place in Manhattan. Don\\'t stay in Harlem. It is not going to save you any significant time and it will likely waste time for you. If driving once you get to the edges of Manhattan its more higher speed roads vs icity streets with constant lights. red259- thank you so much. This is really helpful and hadn\\'t thought of this. I do think we will stay in the city with a couple day trips to The Bronx. Wondering though - when I plug everything in for a transit ride from downtown to The Bronx, I come up with a 52 minute commute. I\\'ll be coming south on 95 and want to find a place to park my car for a night or two while my two teens and I stay in Manhattan. This would probably be July 24 and 25, or possibly just the 24th. We would then be heading south on 95 toward Washington DC.\\nI\\'ll be driving a fairly small SUV with a luggage carrier on the roof that gives the vehicle a height of just under 7 feet. Some parking garages don\\'t allow for this height, but some do.\\nI\\'d like to park where there is public transit that can take us into Manhattan, or that will take us to a subway station that can get us to Manhattan. I\\'d like to avoid driving to our hotel both because I am concerned about finding appropriate parking and because I don\\'t feel particularly comfortable driving in the city. Stamford, CT or New Rochelle, NY Find a garage in Manhattan that will accommodate the height. For a short trip, far easier to be in the city. Stay somewhere on the west side with easy access to the Holland or Lincoln Tunnels, this way it\\'s easy to get back on I95 heading south. I agree with 2 . I belive Stamford only has garages, plus is a decent sized city with city traffic. Plus you will be going a decent way Northeast just to head southwest again. Plus IMO DC harder to drive in than NYC.\\nEdited: 10:06 pm, May 18, 2021 You got a suggestion of a garage in Manhattan on your other thread\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13551915-Hotel_with_non_garage_parking_near_public_transportation-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nThere\\'s a garage at the Port Imperial ferry terminal in Weehawken,NJ. I don\\'t know if it will take your vehicle. You can then take the ferry to Manhattan, a fun way to arrive. The parking that was suggested on the other thread sounded good but I looked it up and the website says it\\'s currently closed.\\nThe ferry does sound like a fun option! Port Imperial would work, but considering your route, I still suggest just finding something in Manhattan as I suggested earlier. You were asked in the other thread as to where you were staying so an outside lot would be reachable. That still might be your most convenient option Staying in Stamford allows you to bypass NYC, you take the Tappan Zee Bridge to the Garden State Parkway (Which allows trailers) and then get back on the NJ turnpike , which I think is exit 11 Secaucus Junction has an open air lot and is a 10 minute train ride to Penn Station. It is right off the NJ Turnpike. Whether or not this is convenient depends on where you are staying. I find Northern NJ driving to be just as bad or worse than driving in Manhattan.\\nWhen I went to Manhattan last month, I used the BestParking app to find parking close to the Lincoln tunnel. I would identify a couple of garages near where you are staying that can accommodate your vehicle and make a reservation through an app when you get there. A lot of garages have lifts that stack the cars to fit more in, and all will valet your car. I agree parking someplace like Stamford makes less geographic sense for your southbound onward travel\\nIf you like the idea of avoiding the city by using the Tappan Zee (Cuomo) bridge look at someplace more directly north such as White Plains or Tarrytown\\nMetro North map http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/mnrmap.htm If you click on the town names on the map it will give you parking info. Contact the parking operators to inquire about height limits and security\\nOne potential concern with any of the station parking, especially if you have to use a surface lot, is what overnight security they may have\\nI think you\\'re much more likely to find 24/7 attended parking in Manhattan\\nDepending on your hotel location you can probably do minimal driving in Manhattan and the expense of MN tickets is probably better spent on Manhattan parking\\nEdited: 9:09 am, May 19, 2021 Does a hotel in the Central Park/Rockefeller Center area make sense for our (tentative) itinerary? Or should we look elsewhere? Any suggestions on specific hotels? We\\'re a family of 5 (3 adults, 2 kids). In the past we\\'ve tended to prefer 4-star properties. We\\'d get two rooms.\\nOur tentative itinerary:\\nSunday - arrive mid-day and go to the Museum of Natural History (tickets obtained). After dinner 1 adult and kids will explore Times Square while the other 2 adults go to the Friends Experience (tickets obtained).\\nMonday - Start the day at the Met, then walk through Central Park until we get to the Zoo. Top of the Rock in the late afternoon.\\nTuesday - Statue of Liberty (ferry tickets obtained). Brooklyn Bridge Park in the afternoon, walk back to Manhattan across the bridge.\\nWednesday - Leave by train after breakfast Location is not that important as long as you\\'re near a subway station - preferably one that serves several lines.\\nIn order to give you good recommendations we need exact dates of travel (hotes rates vary daily), budget including 15% taxes & bedding configuration The things you plan are in different areas so while the location you mention is fine, the upper west side near the Museums would also be fine.the Beacon hotel and the Arthouse are both fine but more 3-3.5*.\\nIn midtown near Rockefeller Center, Lotte Palace, Conrad Midtown, the Warwick, the Intercontinental Berkshire. The Marriott Essex House on Central Park South would also work. The location is important to us. I\\'m looking at hotels near subway stations, but there are many too choose from. We\\'d prefer to be central to our interests (shortening the travel time each day), than convenient to one site and longer travel times on other days. I\\'m not familiar enough with the subway system to know if that would happen in the upper west side versus other areas?\\nWe\\'ll be in NYC from 6/20-6/23. We will be booking two rooms; 1 adult 2 kids in one room (two beds needed); 2 adults in another room (1 queen or king bed). The budget is somewhat flexible but around $200 per room/per night would work. On the UWS you would be further from your Tuesday plans than if you stay in midtown but you’d be walking distance to both museums a d Central Park.\\nAs for subway stations, if you map any hotel on Google maps, subway stations are indicated by blue “M”. You can also get subway directions there. Go to\\nMaps.google.com\\nType the trip from point a to b there (ie Beacon Hotel, NY to Statue of Liberty ferry) click the train icon at the\\ntop and you get subway directions. The default setting (car) is driving. The person icon shows you a walking route and each gives estimated time to travel.\\nI haven\\'t checked prices on any of these. In normal times, $200 for a 4* hotel would be low, but post pandemic it might work. The new M Social Hotel Times Square (formerly Novotel New York) is opening somewhat imminently and offering outstanding \"Opening Special Rates.\" For the best value you must join the Millennium Hotels and Resorts loyalty program before booking. It\\'s free quick and easy to join online. Hotel is on W. 52nd Street at Broadway between Times Square and Central Park. Several subway stops nearby. For your dates the opening special rates are well below your budget. Cancellation policy is 24 hours before arrival. Even with the mandatory daily resort fee ($25) this is an exceptional value. Also be mindful of the hotels that have the resort fee as well in case that is an issue. The Beacon Hotel, on the Upper West Side, is located just a block or two away from a major subway stop at Broadway and 72d St. Both the local 1 train and the 2 and 3 express trains stop there. On an express train it is only 1 stop to Times Square. You can walk to the Museum of Natural History. You can also walk thru the park to the Met or, if you prefer, take the 79th st. crosstown bus through the park. Am not sure where Friends thing is, I think near Union Square. You can get there starting with the subway by the hotel and transferring to something that will get you closer at 42d St, 14th st, or a couple other places. Any of those Broadway subway lines will get you downtown for the statue ferry, Brooklyn Bridge, etc. On the UWS, there are buses on Broadway going both uptown and downtown. There are crosstown buses on W65/66, W72 and W79, though only the ones on W66 and W79 will take you straight thru the park to the east side.\\nThere is a good free subway map you can get at major subway and train stations, There are also bus maps for each of the five boroughs, including Manhattan, though these are not always as available as the subway map. These should also be available online. My husband and I are visiting family in Rockland County and would like to stay in NYC for one night. We are going to a Yankees game. The next day, we are leaving in the afternoon. We just want to visit central park and maybe the history museum. Not sure. Hotel suggestions for June 29? Cheaper on the west side? Trying to keep cost around 150-200 and low cost parking since we\\'ll have a car. Thanks guys! Seems like the ideal place to stay would be either UWS or the northern portion in Hell\\'s Kitchen (in the 50s). Park would be right there. Natural History museum is there and for the yankee game you can take the D train from Columbus circle up to Yankee stadium, which would only be four stops. Plenty of restaurant options in area as well Thank you! Best food suggestions near there? No Chinese, no seafood ( I live in FL and have tons of delicious seafood options). Maybe for breakfast or lunch? The upper west side would be ideal.\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nArthouse Hotel\\nNot sure they fit the budget. Those hotels may have deals with local garages.\\nBestparking.com\\nSpothero.com\\nare websites to check parking near any hotel. Your awesome! Thanks. Have a great Summer 👍 For your June 29 date, the new M Social Times Square Hotel (formerly Novotel New York) is offering an outstanding \"Opening Special\" deal. The hotel is scheduled to open imminently. It\\'s located north of Times Square and an easy walk (7 short blocks) to the south end of Central Park. To get the deal you must join the Millennium Hotels and Resorts loyalty program before booking. It\\'s free, quick and easy to join online. You can get a room with a king or 2 double beds for $89. $130 total including taxes and the daily mandatory resort fee. View rooms are priced slightly higher. Still well below your budget. Surprisingly the deal also includes complimentary parking. This is an exceptional value. The deal was so good, I booked 2 nights. $253 for 2 nights, free drinks and free parking. Thanks! Happy Summer. We are taking our 9 year old son next month. This is his first trip to NYC. We plan on visiting the Natural History Museum and Empire State building. Besides that I know he\\'ll want to check out fun parks, playgrounds, any fountains where he can splash around. We plan on walking a lot and eating so much pizza and dessert. We\\'ll mostly be doing outside activities. Where to stay is the big question. I need some hotel experts.\\nOur dates are June 15-20th. Two adults one child. Would like a place that\\'s a bit bigger ( by NYC standards ), maybe a small suite with a mini refrigerator. Our price range around $450 with tax a night. I was thinking The Maritime in Chelsea. I also have Hyatt points as well but I am not sure if Hotel 50 Bowery or The Beekman are a good location. I keep looking in the Chelsea are. Anyone have any suggestions? Thank you If it were me I would look on the upper west side for places to stay. Chelsea is ok, but there are more playgrounds in central park or riverside drive plus the natural museum of history is on the UWS plus easy access to transit. I see the Conrad both downtown and Midtown are showing good prices on Expedia for your dates. They are both close to a lot of the cooler playgrounds also check out Timeout kids NY website they have lists of the best playgrounds and good events calendars.\\nTry Industry Kitchen pizza if you stay downtown. Also the area has Brookfield place & free kayaks along the Hudson and mini golf on the pier.\\nHappy planning & (most importantly) Have Fun!\\nEdited: 6:19 pm, May 18, 2021 Upper west Side. Not only are there neighborhood playgrounds but you are a few very short blocks from Central Park. Here\\'s a handy guide to the playgrounds https://mommypoppins.com/new-york-city-kids/parks-playgrounds/central-parks-top-playgrounds-ranked\\nAs much as I like Chelsea, UWS with a 9yo will be a lot better.\\nWe liked the Arthouse hotel- lots of interesting room and suite options and many are generously sized. I agree on the Upper West Side and suggest you check out the Hotel Beacon. I agree 100% with the Upper West Side recommendations. The AMNH is a must... Before COVID, I would enjoy casually dropping in for short visits along with our time in Central Park. Central Park is a wonderland to explore. If possible, attend a show at the Swedish marionette theater, explore Belvedere Castle, the turtle pond, rent a rowboat, rent a remote-controlled boat at the boat pond, visit the central park zoo and also pop into the met to see the Egyptian pyramids. (Back in my day the museums were pay-as-you-wish, so it was cost-effective to casually and quickly visit, now you must pay full price and schedule a time to visit). There was also a fun splash fountain tucked behind the museum that my son loved for cooling off on hot humid days. Lastly, be sure to look for fireflies in the park at dusk... a magical experience! The park has so many fabulous playgrounds... It is relaxing and a great place to enjoy the city and feel like a local.\\nPre-Covid, the Empire state building is a nightmare to visit (Exhausting and over-priced). I would skip this and instead take the circle line sunset cruise to enjoy the skyline from the water. Visit the John J Harvey fireboat and read the book in advance.\\nMy son also loved the transit museum in Brooklyn and the Intrepid Air & Space Museum.\\nHave a fabulous trip!\\nIt is a bit expensive, but the Park Hyatt is a great spot if you can swing it. We also stayed at the Hyatt House in Chelsea (a great hotel with nice sized rooms, but I really don\\'t like staying in midtown) The Maritime is a trendy hotel with relatively small rooms. The Beekman in the financial district is not a bad idea. There are lots of parks down there and near ferries. On the upper west side\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nhas suites with kitchenettes. There is a great Playground on the East Side of Central park, Just north of the Childrens Zoo The Arthur Ross terrace at the AMNH has a fountain you can play in If you want to stay in Chelsea, stay in Chelsea. Its not like people who are in Chelsea don\\'t have kids. When we were there, my son loved going to the Clement Moore Park on West 22nd. We often spent time there on weekend mornings and would go to Empire Diner for brunch across the street afterwards. Super convenient. The secret garden park on West 17th was also a fun spot.\\nETA: Also Chelsea piers is right by. Lots to do there. At least there used to be in the pre-pandemic days. Spent a huge amount of time there with the kids.\\nEdited: 7:58 am, May 19, 2021 We are planning to visit from the UK end of July if the borders open and have got listed the below playgrounds as my children will be 6 and 7 at the time.\\nCentral Park\\nPier 25 for mini golf\\nProspect park in Brooklyn including lakeside activities\\nPier 6 in Brooklyn and then walking back to Pier 1\\nPier 51 for children\\'s water park\\nMaybe a day trip to Coney Island, Governors park or visiting the Brooklyn Children\\'s museum\\nHope this helps The American Museum of Natural History announced that its Gems and Minerals Galleries will reopen on June 12th. This was my favorite place in the museum when it was a room with one entrance that invited you to explore the various levels via ramps and steps. From the few images provided, it seems the space has been made into a corridor with the exhibits along the sides. This seems less interesting to me, though one would have to actually see it. At one time the museum had a beautiful seashell exhibit that has completely vanished.\\nEdited: 3:31 pm, May 19, 2021 The Hall of Minerals and Gems remains in the same location in the museum. For now, the only entrance/exit for the hall is still at the dead end after walking through the halls of Human Origins and Meteorites. When the Gilder Center is completed (supposed to be next year), it\\'s my understanding that Minerals and Gems will finally be walk-through, with new second entrance/exit into the Gilder Center. The Gilder Center will include a museum entrance at Columbus and 79th -- so it will be much easier to reach Minerals and Gems at that point, and I imagine the hall will get a lot more visitors. (For better or for worse, depending on your perspective).\\nThe newly updated Minerals and Gems definitely has a sleek 21st Century look. Previously the hall had a look very specific to the time of its last renovation in the 1970s. When I was training to be a guide at AMNH in 2012, the curator of the hall half-jokingly appealed to us to try to find someone to remodel it. Museum volunteers called Minerals and Gems \"the cat house\" because it was entirely covered in shag carpeting with lots of levels and platforms -- it looked like something for your kitten to romp about on. ;-)\\nLoved the old hall, though -- it was dark and dated, but it had its charm. I\\'m sure they\\'ve gotten rid of the giant jade slide in the new design...there was always a guard standing near it to make sure it wasn\\'t used by a visitor for its initial intended purpose...even 50 years ago, I think it took about 5 minutes after opening to realize a slide in the hall was a bad idea!!\\nEdited: 4:38 pm, May 19, 2021 The Drama Book Shop is officially opening on June 10th, 2021 at 266 W. 39th Street\\nA shopping reservation is required: https://www.dramabookshop.com/\\nWill definitely be on my list for my next trip Planning to return in June 2022. I have already reserved a terrace room at the Artezen at a cancellable rate. Husband is not so sure of the choice now as the terraces look really enclosed with no view. So looking at other choices now.. On my list I am now looking at the following\\nMarriott Downtown - rooms recently renovated with views over the Hudson or Harbour\\nAndaz Wall Street - large rooms but not sure if any have views and maybe a bit out of the way?\\nConrad - looks lovely but again rooms don\\'t seem to have views.\\nThe Millennium Hilton has stunning views but reviews of old rooms and cleanliness not up to scratch has put me off.\\nHas anyone visited the above would love to know others thoughts or if there are other options in the area to consider. I’ve never been to any of the rooms, so not going to comment specifically.\\nBut just some info about Fidi: the area was the first part of Manhattan that was settled, long before there were zoning rules and things like setback requirements. So many of the buildings are close together and some of the streets are narrow. So while there “should” be good views because it is the tip of manhattan, close to the rivers, the views are often blocked.\\nAlso, the Andaz is down Wall St from the Stock Exchange, not far from a 2-3 Wall St train stop, and not far from other trains. Not out of the way at all. Also close to the ferry stop at Pier 11. Easiest way to get an answer for a question like this re: views is to look at recent youtube videos of those hotel rooms by guests. Will usually show you the types of views you can see out the window. I don\\'t really stay in hotel rooms in NYC, but in general I like the Andaz brand a lot which is like a trendy mid-level hyatt hotel, not sure the Andaz is really setup for the best views though. Conrad is more of a top end luxury brand for Hilton (more comparable with Hyatt\\'s Park Hyatt brand), so it is a different vibe. I stay with both brands and find the Conrad is good if you want more guest services where the Andaz brand is good if you want more style but don\\'t really desire a full service hotel staff. I think the Conrad probably has great views of the hudson but the reason for that is because it is over by the hudson and therefore not super close to mass transit. Marriott seems to have decent views and appears to be a bit closer to transit. The service at the Marriott brand is typically less extensive than that you get at a Conrad. Hi - we have stayed at these two Hilton properties in the area.... Millennium Hilton opposite the WTC/Oculus and at the Hampton Inn on 32 Pearl St.\\nYour views on the Millennium are spot on - tired and dated.... but good location. But we stayed here for one night only....\\nHowever, our stay at the Hampton Inn was very good - if you do not mind the location - almost at the southern tip of Manhattan... but just a 5min walk from the charging bull statue and NYSE.\\nOur review of the Hampton Inn is here.... our stay was in Jan 01-07 2020:\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/ybz33rxm Alfie - continuing my above post..... my son stayed at the Conrad in Oct 2020 for a week - after his wedding and invited us to his room for the evening on one of the days. The room was in front of the Irish Hunger Memorial.... so had a nice view of the Hudson river and Newport City skyline. However, the views were not fully \\'\\'clear\\'\\' - interrupted by the building in front of the hotel that also houses the Battery Park Library.\\nSee below - the room was on the left side of the atrium.... so views not fully clear.\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/yjnah7jd\\nhttps://tinyurl.com/ye995cm5\\nHope this helps..... The Conrad has rooms with views of the Statue of Liberty. They list view rooms right on their website\\nhttps://www.conradnewyork.com/stay/hudson-river-view-with-sofa-bed.html We stay at the Millennium on a regular basis and we stay at the Conrad when we get free rooms. In fact we will be at the Conrad for Memorial Day weekend.\\nI really don\\'t care about views, I like them if we get them from the room, but we don\\'t seek them out. I prefer more space over views.\\nWe stay at the Millennium probably six times a year and have stayed there four times since September 2020. You are correct that it is a little dated. It was totally refurbished after 9/11 and that make most of the hotel 20 years old. Not ancient, but the rooms are hit and miss. Out of the four times we have stayed in the past year, I would say one of them was very bad and the rest were fine. The rooms themselves are nothing special but almost every room has a great view.\\nThe Conrad is entirely different level, both in service and price. It is all suites and it is in great shape. We have only stayed there once and we were on a low floor so the view wasn\\'t much. But the service was great, we were assigned a concierge and she followed up on everything.\\nAgain, I have never felt the need for a terrace or a balcony when I have been in NYC. In Puerto Rico it is essential, but in NYC it is a waste. Thankyou all for your thoughts - will take the time to look at each one. My last trip to NY was in November of 2019 and I stayed at the Millenium Hilton then. Yes rooms were nice but not fancy but then neither am I. My view from the 25th floor was spectacular, I would stay there again. I am a frequent business traveller and I have stayed at the Marriott Financial a bunch of times. I like the hotel for it\\'s good service and the valets works hard to get you where you need to go. They can arrange trips to any of the local airports.\\nThe hotel rooms are nice and I generally get upgraded to a King room with a view of the SOL...these rooms are slightly larger than the standard kings at this property. Service is very good and I always appreciate the Starbucks in the lobby area. The concierge lounge here is very nice but I don\\'t think any of these are open yet. The adjacent restaurant is OK for BK but not my favorite hotel restaurant for sure...service there is always slow\\nYou can easily walk to the Towers Memorial from here as well as Battery Park, and other locations in the financial district. It\\'s an easy walk to Eataly which I love to bring home some treats at the end of my trips. I can\\'t comment on views, I normally don\\'t seek those out when booking hotel rooms. At least it\\'s not a top priority for me - other things are. Financial District is in general a great area to stay in. Lots of subway lines (important for me) with easy access to anything I could think of doing when in town.\\nIf you do figure out that some hotels have views that appeal to you, I would contact the hotel directly before booking a room to ask how you can secure such a room. I figure sometimes it could be that some rooms in the same category has views and others not. There\\'s a good chance I\\'ll be wanting to attempt to catch the 5 at Pelham Pkwy (not the rush hour 2-5 line) and that seems to be no problem during the weekdays, but on the weekends I\\'m just seeing \"Shuttle Train Service\" and that it looks like it might not even operate between Dyer/233rd and Bowling Green.\\nSo I\\'m a bit confused if the actual stations such as Morris Park, Pelham Pkwy are actually going to be closed or not? If so I could always walk to the 2-5 line, but just want to verify if on weekends how that 5 line between E-180th to Dyer works? Check out the \"MTA Weekender\". Service changes happen just about every weekend throughout the system. What happens this weekend may not happen when you visit.\\nYou can also use this:\\nhttps://new.mta.info/planned-service-changes/subway I am not that familiar with that line but my recollection is that it does not run as regularly as the 6 or 4, the other trains on the Lexington Av line in Manhattan. Whenever I have waited in midtown Manhattan for a train to Brooklyn Atlantic Av it\\'s always been a 4 that has come, not a 5. So it\\'s possible that shuttle operates regularly during the periods the 5 isn\\'t running or isn\\'t running its full route, not because those stations are closed. But I\\'m really not sure. There is a number you can call at NYC Transit when you can\\'t get the info you need from their website. I think the 5 runs differently late nights and weekends https://new.mta.info/document/9446\\nYou\\'ll probably have to make a transfer\\nCheck the trip planner for the date you plan to travel https://new.mta.info/ Are you visiting someone in the Bronx? Are you trying to go to a certain place there? If you are visiting someone then you are much better off asking them about the situation with the local subway stations as it doesn\\'t seem like it is always open and you may need to go to alternative stations and walk to your destination depending on the time of day or if it is a weekend. If you’re talking specifically this weekend, a quick translation of the service advisory is:\\nThe 5 isn’t running at all.\\nIf you’re traveling between Dyer and E 180th, there is a bus alternative instead. So if you arrived at Pelham Parkway, instead of going up, there would be some sort of bus stop on the street level (you’d have to check the MTA website for precisely where the pick up point would be , but they’re usually marked with yellow posted signage—\\nalso the staircase would typically be chained of with corresponding service advisory signage as well) . That bus would take you as far as E 180th. From there, you would be able to transfer to a 2 train , which could take you all the way through Manhattan via the westside , or if you were trying to get to a 5 station along the east side, you would transfer from the 2 train at Grand Concourse to catch the 4 train instead Sounds like AMS has nailed it. They have been doing a huge amount of work on the subways, not all of which is announced as far ahead as one would like, plus the info on the MTA website is not always as clear as one would like. `My grandparents used to live in Pelham parkway so I am very familiar with the area\\nThere are 2 Pelham parkway stations one on the 2 Line and one on the 5 Line\\nThe one on the 2 Line operates 24/7. The on on the Dyre Ave Line (The 5 train) runs a shuttle between 180th St and Dyre Ave Late Night. During that time the trains run, but you have to switch to the 2 train at 180th St.\\nIf you can , go to the Pelham Parkway station on the 2 Line (White Plains road), the stations are about a mile apart or less Yes that\\'s what I was thinking was what AMS stated. I was trying to see the closures, but seems it\\'t not just a maintenance thing, but more of a standard \"it just doesn\\'t run on the weekends\" thing. yes the other Pelham Pkwy one would be the one I would use (the Western one on the 2) and no issues with doing that at all.\\nI guess it\\'s more like a limited service train much like the W line and such I suppose which also I think doesn\\'t run on the weekends.\\nGood to know, I won\\'t bother walking to the Eastern Pelham Pkwy station then and will just use the one next to the park...

You could do the Brooklyn Bridge (after sitting in the train all that time) and maybe have dinner in Brooklyn. OR head to Greenwich Village, walk Perry St. and have dinner in the area. I\\'d try to book a dinner reservation once you decide what you want to do.\\nI have no problem with your itinerary but might change the order some. Look at a map. Maybe start at Chelsea Market (breakfast?) or the south end of the High Line ( helsea Market is in the middle) and walk north toward Hudson Yards. Also think about whether you will make purchases at Macy\\'s in which case do it toward the end of the day so you,re not carrying bags. You may not be able to bring bags up Top do the Rock. Macy,s is near Penn station. If you don\\'t have much luggage, maybe stop at Macy,s when you arrive (or when you\\'re leaving).\\nI think your feet will be tired on day 4 between Met and the park\\nI hope you\\'ve already booked your SOL/Ellis Island tickets. If not, do ASAP.\\nThink about some dining choices and do a bit of research.\\nAs to best observation deck, haven\\'t been to them all, but I do like TOTR. You could also take the free Staten Island Ferry on the first evening for those iconic views of Lower Manhattan. Works well both in daylight and in the evenings - especially if it\\'s a clear day.\\nOr take the subway to Times Square the first evening to see the lights then and free up one other everning for other activites. Perhaps spend that freed up time in a nice area such asGreenwich Village (hang out in Washington Square Park - it can appeal to all ages) or East Village.\\nI like TOTR for the views of Central Park and Empire State Building - I find the actualy ESB more interesting than the views from ESB and you can get great photo shots of ESB from TOTR.\\nEdited: 10:31 am, May 06, 2021 Also, you could take the subway to Brooklyn instead of walking the bridge both ways. Walk the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, spend some time in Brooklyn Bridge park and DUMBO and then walk the bridge back to Manhattan. Look pretty good - but not sure you\\'ve listed items in the order you intend to do them\\nIf you walk the Highline S to N you will end up closer to Macy\\'s\\nThe Strand is south of the ESB. If you have the time you could walk down 5th and Broadway and take in Madison Square park and Union Square between the two\\nOn you arrival evening you might consider a ride on the Staten Island ferry to take in the harbor/SOL/skyline views https://www.siferry.com/schedules.html\\nhttps://downtownny.com/ is a useful resource\\nBuy the earliest available SOL/Ellis tickets from Statue Cruises ASAP You need to reserve tickets ahead of time for the Met; not sure you\\'ll be able to get those.\\nLove your itinerary. I\\'m taking my two teens the same weekend and you\\'ve given me some new ideas. thanks!!! Thanks everyone for the feedback! That\\'s a great idea to plan something concrete for our arrival night. I also appreciate the tips for doing the Brooklyn Bridge.\\nTo answer some questions:\\nNo, I didn\\'t necessarily put each days spots in order of how we\\'ll do them. I just tried to group things by geographic area. I\\'ll go back and take a look at my maps and put together an itinerary in order.\\nWe will have all day Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Is there a better day to do the Met or Highline? As of this moment, I still have my choice of reservations for all of these activities for all our available days. Or does it really not matter because everything will be busy enough? Be flexible in terms of weather. If it rains, you would want to go to the MET and switch outdoor plans to the next day for example. Skip the 9/11 museum unless you want to be really depressed. It is like reliving the day. My opinion, I realize. Evening one. Head down to Perry St and eat dinner in the Village perhaps. Have your daughters keep their eyes on TONY next week. They will always list some interesting things to do for the wknd and especially for the holiday wknds.\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork Ok, Here is another Off-beat NYC travel report, All these places are really in Brooklyn , USA. The house are mostly located in the Flatlands/Marine Park Section and its very interesting to see an old dutch farmhouse located on a Brooklyn Street, they are clearly out of place\\nThe first stop was the The Stoothoof Baxter-Kouwenhaven House Dates which dates from 1747,\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CO84Zd_tLVL/\\nMy next stop was the Hendrick Lot house , Unlike most of the houses here, this one is a museum, but it closed now due to covid, It dates from 1720\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CO-JLoctG-x/\\nMy Next house was the Wycoff Bennet House from 1766, This house went up for sale last summer at $3.2 Million, Its only had 3 owners. The city had tried to buy it before, but seems to have low balled the owners. I do not know if its still for sale, but if you want a Dutch Farmhouse in NYC, and you have $3.2 Million, here is your chance\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CO_vRuyNlYI/\\nThe Van Nuyse-Magaw House dates from early 1800\\'s Its unusual in that almost all the houses on this block are McMansions and here you have the Dutch Farmhouse, You can see the house is facing the wrong way, Its facing the house next door as opposed to facing the street. Obviosuly the house is older than the Street\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPA8Ml2t5r6/\\nMy next stop was The Joost Van Nuyse House or Ditmas Cole house in Flatlands/Marine Park Brooklyn, Dates from 1744 and was enlarged between 1793 and 1806\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPBjQzmNqrd/\\nThese first 6 houses are just on regular streets, You see a normal block in Brooklyn and all of a sudden you see this Dutch Farmhouse and an Oddly looking property. The Wycoff- Bennet has a huge land area for Brooklyn\\nMy next stop was the Lefferts Homestead from 1766 in prospect Park, Unfortunatly this house is under rehabiltation, so My photo isnt that good. Its right next to the Prospect Park Zoo and across the street from Brooklyn Botanical Gardens.\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPBkU4NNPkh/\\nMy Last Stop was a more traditional tourist spot, Domino Park in Williamsburg. I think some old Domino Sugar Factory was converted to a Park. For those who think NYC is dead, this place was packed full of People. You can get awesome views of the NYC skyline from here\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CPBkrOxNVYd/\\nand\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/oGVI6wj BTW if you are curious how I found these places, Along with the Old houses in the Other Boroughs, I googles them and curbed NYC came up or Untapped NYC came up and it listed these places.\\nThere are 2 other old homes that have since been moved into the Brooklyn Museum. I have been there before, but didnt take any photos, I will next time I go there Thank you for going to the trouble of posting, and also for braving the park full of kids (anyone under 30) in pursuit of photos of Domino Park. And yes, it was a former Domino\\'s sugar factory. Fun report! I’ve passed some of those old farmhouses in my wanderings around the borough, always meaning to look up their history but never actually doing so.\\nEdited: 4:46 pm, May 18, 2021 Linda E, I think you\\'ve metioned you live in Park Slope area. I am guessing you have passed the Lefferts Homestead many times before, Its not in it original location, It was moved there to preserve it. The other houses are in their original locations\\nIt was orginally by Flatbush Ave and Maple Ave. In the Lefferts Gardens Historic Distric\\nEdited: 5:38 pm, May 18, 2021 Greetings All - My first post in over a year and I am so excited to be vaxed and traveling again. Will be staying in FiDi and have Yankees tix for this Friday night. Regarding transportation, from Google Streetview near the stadium it looks like there are 2 MTA options, subway and an above ground option. Which is the elevated line that might offer some views? Thanks The other option you mention is a Metro North train.\\nIf it were me, I\\'d just take the subway since you can take the 4 train from the Financial District without having to make any changes.\\nI hope someone else comments on the views, I can\\'t remember what they are like for the subway ride. So the thing about the #4 elevated subway line by the stadium is that the tunnel portal is basically right at the stadium. Neither the #4 or the D train will offer any length of above ground views at all. If you\\'re downtown when heading out, take the #4 (Bowling Green, Wall Street, or Fulton St), don\\'t think twice about it. If you happen to be elsewhere in the city when heading up to the stadium you can consider the D if it\\'s convenient.\\nThere\\'s the Metro-North train from Grand Central stopping at the stadium which is above ground starting around 96th St in Manhattan which is an alternative with some views, but I wouldn\\'t bother as the cheaper and more frequent #4 is right at Grand Central as well. Thank you for the advice!\\n---- and Go White Sox! haha Easiest is just taking the 4 train. I think the OP is mixing up the 7 train to Citifeld (Mets) vs the 4 train to Yankee Stadium. The 7 train to Citifield give a great view of Queens and of Approaching Citifiled (There is sort of an excitement when you first see it in the distanace)\\nthe 4 or D train to Yankee Stadium missed that , the D train is underground and the 4 train just comes outside right by Yankee Stadium I have taken that Metro North train multiple times over the last 3 months(not for a Yankee game.) The views are nothing special because you are only going 2 stops.\\nI would also take the subway. Cheaper and more frequent. Have booked a surprise trip for my husband\\'s 60th birthday (not intending telling him until we arrive at airport!!) end of March 22. Have already booked flights and hotel (Hampton Inn Manhattan/Times Square).\\nWould appreciate advice with itinerary.\\nDay 1 - Arrive hotel early evening so thinking of walking around Times Square.\\nDay 2 - 911 Memorial and Museum then subway to Brooklyn Bridge High Street and walk back over Brooklyn Bridge. Evening - Have booked tickets for Jersey Boys.\\nDay 3 - Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island, Macy\\'s. Evening Empire State Building.\\nDay 4 - Top of the Rock, Chrysler Building, St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral, Grand Central Station, KGB Espionage Museum, Chelsea Market. Evening Staten Island Ferry.\\nDay 5 - Roosevelt Tram, Central Park. Evening Billy Joel MSG (tickets already purchased).\\nDay 6 - Undecided, will have approx 5 hours before heading to airport. Any suggestions?\\nI am only considering booking the SOL/Ellis Island in advance, but is it advisable to book all?\\nTIA The Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island is arguably the most popular attraction in all of NYC. You need to purchase tickets ASAP from Statue Cruises - the only way to get to Liberty Island without paying 3rd party fees. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 4:57 pm, May 17, 2021 Yup, book the SOL tickets in advance. Having a fairly early morning slot is typically advisable, at least in prepandemic times. Lines and crowds pretty much always got a bit longer later on in the day even for people with tickets. Don\\'t miss the new-ish museum on Liberty Island when you\\'re there. Absolutely nothing wrong with what you have.\\nI just noted that you are walking the Bklyn Bridge, going up to the ESB, Top of the Rock and the Roosevelt tram. That is basically seeing NYC from up high on 4 consecutive days.\\nI might look to see more NYC from down below. I would spend a day checking out a neighborhood that isn\\'t a typical tourist attraction, but still has loads to do/see......Chinatown(Brooklyn or Queens)/Lower East Side/E Village/etc. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

My teen children and I will be stopping in NYC for one or two nights on our way home from a long road trip. We\\'ll have a luggage carrier on the roof that makes my car too tall for parking garages. I\\'m looking for a hotel in a safe area near public transportation, with parking other than garage. I don\\'t mind paying for a valet to park for me. I would prefer not to have to drive much into the city; somewhere on the edge of town with transportation we can utilize would be ideal. Any suggestions? I don\\'t really have a budget I need to keep to; I\\'ll pay what I have to to get what I need (although cheaper is always better, of course, haha). When I had a similar issue I parked here, Edison ParkFast at 451 9th Ave, New York, NY 10018, United States. It was very easy to get to, and is a secured open lot with 24 hours security. Not hotel affiliated, but was very easy to park and walk to our hotel, there are many to choose from within a 5 minute stroll.\\nEdited: 7:44 pm, May 17, 2021 This is a little out of the box, but there is a Holiday Inn by citifield in queens, It has outdoor Parking and is a 5 Min walk to the nearest Subway Station. According to the website its $22 to park there, Still plenty of outdoor lots in Manhattan, mostly west of 9th Avenue or south of Greenwich Village Few NYC hotels have their own garages (parking offered may be an arrangement with a third party location)\\nLook for parking via bestpparking.com, Icon parking, or spothero\\nCheck the height limitations for each place and be aware they may charge a premium in your case\\nI think there might be some hotels in Weehawken or Jersey City that might work (near the PATH train or a ferry) One option to consider is https://thehollandhotel.com/amenities-services/ in Jersey City. because they have a free surface parking lot for a variety of vehicle types. Not fancy but in convenient walking distance to the PATH train.\\nThe PATH train is similar to, but separate from, the NYC subway system and provides inexpensive 24/7 ($2.75/ride) access to Manhattan https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/schedules-maps.html\\nFor other across the Hudson river NJ locations there are ferries https://www.nywaterway.com/FerryTerminals.aspx and buses but they cost more and have shorter hours\\nEdited: 9:14 am, May 18, 2021 P.S. Depending on which direction for you are approaching from, be aware the passenger car only NYS parkway system has height restrictions due to low bridges https://www.dot.ny.gov/programs/brochures/parkway-brochure P.P.S I looked at your history and am under the impression you may be traveling with camping gear (?)\\nIf yes, you might also want to look at the campsites at https://www.libertyharborrv.com/rates/ which is within walking distance of the PATH train and a ferry There is a wellknown cluster of hotels in the Long Island City neighborhhood of Queens. A couple of them might have very limited parking at the hotel but if not there are certainly public outdoor lots within walking distance. Unload tour car, go park and leave it until your departure.\\nMost of these hotels are near subway stations that are only one or two stops from Midtown Manhattan.\\nEdited: 11:41 am, May 18, 2021 If you are traveling with a camper, you cannot bring it on the Parkways, If you do its a BIG ticket The La Quinta on Queens Blvd has a few parking spots and is convenient to the 7 train\\nhttps://www.wyndhamhotels.com/laquinta/long-island-city-new-york/la-quinta-inn-queens-new-york-city/overview\\n(If they are bringing camping equipment I think it may be tents, etc.)\\nEdited: 12:20 pm, May 18, 2021 We will be visiting NYC coming up next month. I have been to NYC numerous times but have never taken a cab. Given the present situation in the country and in NYC I had some questions should we choose to take one.\\n1. Is it correct that you just wave down those cabs that have their \"light\" on their roof sign?\\n2. I have heard you don\\'t tell the driver where you want to go till you are in the cab?\\n3. Can you give them name of where you want to go or do you need to give them an address. Example we want to take the tram over to Roosevelt Island so do I just say tram terminal or give them the exact address?\\n4. Can you pay via plastic or is cash acceptable?\\n5. What is a fair tip rate?\\n6. What is an acceptable distance? Like going from our hotel The New Yorker to Hudson Yards isn\\'t that far but if raining we may want to take a taxi. Fair tip: 20%\\nFor addresses, it\\'s best to be prepared with avenue / cross streets information. For example, the tramway plaza for the tram would be \"2nd avenue between 59 and 60 streets\". Sure, I think some landmarks be very well known, but the above method works well. In Manhattan anyhow. If you need to go somewhere in the other boroughs, I\\'m not sure of best strategy and I\\'ll leave that to others who knows this better - apart from in relation to taking a cab / car service to and from airports or Penn Station when arriving by train to any hotel I\\'ve stayed at, I\\'ve only taken a cab exactly twice in nine visits and those were in Manhattan. 1. 1. Light on means cab is available\\n2. If a cab is available they are required to take you to your destination within the city limits. Some try to refuse people going to certain places which is against the rules. I never tell a cab driver where I am going until I get in.\\n3. You should have an address. For a famous place like JFK, MET, Times Square etc you just say the name of the place and they know where to go. If you want to go to some small hotel don\\'t expect them to know the address based off the name alone.\\n4. They take cash and card\\n5. Cab tips 10-20% depending on the service. 15% is good for reasonable service On smaller fares I usually make sure to give a couple of dollars.\\n6. I believe there is a minimum charge you will pay no matter what, so if you want to take a cab a short distance then take the cab and don\\'t worry about the taxi. Don\\'t bank on the idea that you will easily find a cab in the rain. or in Times Square when shows let out. I don\\'t know, I think it\\'s rude to expect a taxi driver to take you a short distance, whatever the law is. They are trying to earn a living, it isn\\'t easy driving a cab. And I\\'ve had drivers refuse to take me some place after I was even inside as they thought it was too short (not in NYC, but another city). I would certainly never try to take a taxi for a distance of half a mile or less, that\\'s for sure. I\\'d have to have a good reason to take one only a mile, such as having a lot of luggage. Rain is not a good reason IMO. Take a raincoat and umbrella. Besides, driving someplace can take longer than walking, depending the streets and closures. NY hotel to Hudson yards is about a mile by car by only about a half mile walking. That distance is about $5 minimum taxi fare, more during rush hour or long waiting.\\nEdited: 6:16 pm, May 16, 2021 Taxi drivers love short trips. They get the basic drop rate then plus whatever else. No worries. You have it covered. Sometimes it is luckiest to try to grab a cab near where they let off passengers, such as in front of the Met. Uber, LYft also work in NYC When you are hailing a cab, think about the space where the cab\\'s going to pull into to pick you up. It makes getting in easier. If someone is already hailing a cab on a corner, then you want to not get in front of them, but rather move further along the traffic. That raised arm is the true signal that you want a cab. :). There aren\\'t as many cabs as normal times, but I think more and more are coming back to the City. Yes, the way rates work drivers are incentivized to take riders on short trips. Don\\'t worry about it. But do tip a couple of dollars at least even if 20%, which I think of as the normal tip, works out to be a smaller amount. Yup, cabs make more money on turnover because of the guaranteed minimum, which is higher than the mileage increases. No apologies for short rides necessary, especially if you\\'re taking a cab to a hotel or tourist spot where they are likely to pick up another fare quickly. I had a friend once who hated the cold (and she was from Denver!!). She would take a cab less than ten blocks quite often.\\nAs far as addresses: it used to be that you would give a street or intersection (like: 7th Av and 17th St, or 55th between 5th and 6th). Sometimes, a famous location (the Met, Madison Square Garden). A cab driver used to know best routes based on traffic patterns and times of day. Now, many cab drivers are using GPS, so an exact address helps them (and alleviates their need to actually think).\\nTrue story: I once got into a cab and said \"the Marriott Marquis please.\" Driver: \"where\\'s that?\" Me: \"Times Square.\" Driver: \"where\\'s that?\" Me: Please stop and let me out now. I rarely take taxis, but the reason you dont tell them where you are going until you get in is because they might rerfuse to take you,\\nIt is NOT rude at all to not to tell them, Its the LAW, they need to take you whever you want to go.\\nThis actually happend to me as I grabbed a cab to go to Brooklyn, The Taxi Driver refused to take me to Brooklyn, Luckily there was a Cop nearby and he told the cop that he refused to take me to Brooklyn, He got a $100 ticket and had to spend an afternoon at Taxi court (with lost pay)\\nThey dont like taking people to the outer Boroughs because they usually have to ride back empty (Could be 30 Mins or more without a paying customer)\\nAs someone who lives in Queens and has seen taxi drivers refuse to take me to the outer Bouroughs, I am very happy for Uber/Lyft. I have no sympathies for Taxi drivers and their medallions I personally like to use my cell phone to pay for my cab rides. I have the Arro app on my phone, pair it with the cab when I get it (there\\'s a number of the small tv screen) and it pays the ride with a 20% tip when I leave the cab. Easier than having to use a terminal to pay (and cleaner). Hello,\\nOn our flight home to California from Athens, Greece we change planes at JFK and have a two hour layover. Both flights via Delta. We have never had a layover flying internationally. I am guessing we will do customs upon our arrival at JFK. We only have two hours before our connecting flight departs. Is that enough time? How does it work? We don’t have to go through TSA security and everything again.... do we? Off the plane and follow everyone else to Immigration.\\nClear Immigration and off with everyone else to baggage claim.\\nAfter bag claim you go through Customs. Then drop your bags at bag recheck.\\nThen TSA security before being allowed to enter the terminal to get to your onward flight. If these flights are on a single ticket then Delta will \"protect\" you if you miss your second flight. That is, they\\'ll put you on the next available flight at no additional charge.\\nAssuming these are the best flights for you, or you\\'ve already purchased your tickets, this is a particularly good trip to buy trip insurance for. You want insurance that would cover you for any additional costs, such as a hotel, for missed connections Yes, once you land you\\'ll go through immigration, get your bags and go through customs. Then, after customs, drop your bags off on a conveyor belt (you don\\'t have to queue up with your airline again to re-check luggage), and go through TSA security to make it to your departure gate. Thank you to everyone for the information. Will two hours be enough time to do this and make our flight?\\nWe are on a single Delta tickets. There are 6 of us flying first class or Delta One so it might be hard to get another flight. “ Will two hours be enough time to do this and make our flight?”\\nProbably. You’ll be among the first off the inbound flight, so that gives you an edge.\\nJust don’t stop for the restroom or anything else until you’ve gone through TSA to your next gate area. Great. Thank you so much. We’re a bit nervous about the layover time. That makes me feel better. Those connection times appear to be common for Delta\\nOnce you\\'ve rechecked luggage and reenter the TSA if you need to get to their other terminal there is a jitney bus between T2 and T4 https://www.jfkairport.com/at-airport/connecting-flights I\\'ll be staying near Chinatown and we\\'ll I think we all know that\\'s probably the most expensive and most touristy area in town.\\nMy question is, how does the area in Sunset Park area compare to the Chinese area in Flushing? Would both be maybe worth a visit if one would have the time?\\nI\\'ve just loved going to the Chinese areas in cities around the world and in the US, I\\'d prefer areas that have a lot of \"non-Americanized\" Chinese options, which I\\'m sure in NYC all 3 of these have. My thing is, I\\'ll be seeing stuff not that far from Sunset Park as well as Flushing, but not directly in either. So are both areas worth the extra walking or subway stops to visit do you think or would one be more of a priortiy for me to see over another?\\nI\\'m just thinkin Flushing is probably larger, but maybe Sunset Park, might be more local and authentic that\\'s more over looked by tourists and better? I think both are great; since I live not too far away, I’m much more familiar with Sunset Park. In terms of population of Chinese origin, it’s actually the largest “Chinatown” in NYC. Totally non-touristy, lots of really good food, an interesting mix of small businesses. You can have your shoes or watch repaired by a guy on the street.\\nI also like strolling the residential streets between 8th Av (the main commercial strip) and 7th Av (which is becoming a secondary commercial strip)...or even walking all the way down to the neighborhood’s eponymous park. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 1:21 am, May 09, 2021 Thanks for that response. I do have a few things near Sunset Park to see and if possible I do want to hit that and Flushing. I think from the menu\\'s I\\'ve actually been able to see in NYC, Sunset Park seem to be more my style food (from the limited menus I\\'ve been able to find online), while Flushing seems to be more of the dumpling style places, which I think is better for more groups than single travelers. Though that\\'s just my online assumption.\\nIdeally I want to visit both, but if I\\'ve over planned all the stuff I \"want to see\" this trip, Sunset Park is a lot more accessible I think for me with my plans if it came down to one or another.\\nGood to know though that it\\'s really worth it to go there. I normally never hear much about Sunset Park and that\\'s why I needed a good \"local\" perspective to verify that for me, thank you... I grew up in Sunset/Boro Park so I will always favor the Brooklyn Chinatown.\\nLoads of restaurants, markets and things to see/do. You can couple that with a visit to Greenwood Cemetery, Industry City or a short walk down to 5th Avenue and experience some Spanish/Latin tastes.\\nhttps://www.green-wood.com\\nhttps://industrycity.com -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 1:21 am, May 09, 2021 ** I normally never hear much about Sunset Park **\\nSunset is VERY popular, but maybe not very touristy.\\n-The actual park(as Linda mentioned)\\n-Past Brooklyn Flea location\\n-Industry City\\n-Chinatown\\n-Greenwood Cemetery\\n-5th Ave\\n-Short walk to Park Slope Warlord, I don’t know your tastes, but would be happy to share some of my own SP favorites. I wouldn\\'t say that Manhattan\\'s chinatown is less authentic. In fact some of the restaurants in Manhattan\\'s chinatown are owned by the same people running restaurants in Flushing. Pre-pandemic I would go out to eat with friends from China in Manhattan\\'s chinatown if we didn\\'t feel like heading all all the way out to Flushing. The food in manhattan\\'s chinatown is far from Americanized. Heck in some of the places the servers didn\\'t even speak english. The other chinatowns may be larger but I don\\'t view them as somehow being more authentic than the one in manhattan. In Manhattan’s Chinatown, the rents of first-floor restaurants and gift shops subsidize upstairs rent-stabilized tenements full of chinese people. A lot of these businesses are run by people who struggle with english so weren\\'t able to figure out the emergency loan process. A lot of business they rely upon from all the office workers immediately south of them has dried up with the office employees telecommuting. Another major source of income is from tourism which has taken a major hit during the pandemic. Hopefully too many tourists don\\'t bypass Manhattan\\'s Chinatown trying to find the \"authentic\" chinatown experience, because it is killing the community that is very much authentic and in need. This isn\\'t like Little Italy where the italians are long gone. It is very much a legitimate community. I dont live far from Downtown Flushing, there arent any tourists there. You can combine with a visit to Flushing Meadow Park or a few other sites around that area.\\nIts real autentic there, Just dont be shocked to see a Pig hanging in the restaurant window -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 1:21 am, May 09, 2021 Where is a good place for fast result PCR test in New York city for travel ?

We\\'re starting to think about travel again and I thought I would check rates at the Westhouse but I can\\'t find anything. Their 800 number is not inservice. Are they still in business? No indication they,re closed on their website\\nhttps://www.westhousehotelnewyork.com/ Nywhiz: I agree the website looks \"normal\" but when you try to book it comes back \"no rooms available\". I\\'ve tried with various dates and room types but no luck. They do offer a click through to what they call \"partner hotels\" and they do offer rates at other properties. So that suggests they\\'re closed. You could try calling one of the sister hotels. That’s a good idea. I sent an email to Westhouse but if I don’t hear back soon, I’ll try one of the “sisters”. Hi all!\\nWe are in our 30s and arriving in NYC in mid June for 10 days.\\nExcept for rooftops and bars, any cool idea on how to spend the nights in the city these days?\\nThanks in advance,\\nTal Check City Winery and Pier 17 websites for music performances to see if anything interests you. (I suspect if ter sees this, he will have lots of other music suggestions, if that\\'s what you\\'re interested in.)\\nYou can take the Staten Island Ferry at night.\\nWhat do you like to do? You can probably go to sporting events also. From the faq...this is specific to under 21’s but lots of good ideas and links\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k9262285-From_infants_to_20_year_olds_things_to_do_at_night_in_NYC-New_York_City_New_York.html It would be helpful if you would define what \"cool ideas\" mean to you. This is one of the cooler live music calendars\\nhttps://www.ohmyrockness.com/\\nNot as many options as there were a couple years ago, but definitely more than last year.\\nHope this helps & have fun! Well, my first day back in NYC didn’t go as planned. While walking up towards Wash Sq (never made it) someone was coming up from the sidewalk under one of those hatch door grates that was in the middle of the sidewalk. I tripped and caught myself from completely falling and luckily no broken bones. I was all set to continue walking until I saw blood seeping from my jeans. I went back to the room assessed my injury bought some gauze tape Neosporin, cleaned it up and iced my shin. I thought maybe a surface vein had been nicked. Upon further inspection this morning it looks a bit deeper and bled some overnight. I think it’s best to go to an urgent care to get it looked at. I don’t care how far away the urgent care is I just would like the top urgent care location recommendation please. Thank you I\\'m so sorry!\\nThere a chain called CityMD that has numerous locations. I think this one is close to your hotel https://www.citymd.com/urgent-care-locations/ny/manhattan/financial-district/318\\nIt opens at 8.\\nYou might also ask the hotel desk Where exactly are you staying? There is also a CityMD on Fulton Street, near the Fulton Transit Hub. They’re our go-to place for things like this and they’ve always been good.\\nhttps://www.citymd.com/urgent-care-locations/ny/manhattan/fulton/057 In addition to the urgent care BatteryParkNYC mentioned, there’s another CityMD at 30 Broad St. Feel better!\\nEdited: 10:24 am, May 17, 2021 Thank you all! I walked around the corner to the CityMed Fulton and was in and out within 20 mins. Tetanus shot, wound cleaning, Streri-strip, gauze and compression bandaging. Good to go! I’ve been at Long Island City’s waterfront for a few hours and waiting for the ferry to Roosevelt Island on this beautiful day. Glad you’re ok. I sent a message to your inbox last time you were here...did you get it? Yikes, I do hope that\\'s all the medical attention you\\'ll need and that you\\'ll feel better and will be able to enjoy the rest of your stay. Trying to decide between these two hotels for a trip in September last week.\\nSofitel seems to be more luxury, smaller hotel, less busy area, good location oin 5th Avenue. But the rooms are older, don\\'t see anything about recent renovations?\\nMarriot Marquis though was renovated last year during Covid so the rooms are new. Reviews are hit and miss, service likely an issue when the hotel has so many rooms.\\nI have Gold status with Marriott too, nothing with Accor.\\nWhich one would you suggest? Or something else in same price range.\\n26th to 30th September, getting these from 1600 USD - 1800 USD for 4 nights. About 15 years ago, when it was new, Sofitel was consistently ranked #1 NYC hotel in Trip Advisor reviews. You should go through most recent reviews for it here, and on sites like booking.com, hotels.com, expedia, etc. to get clearer picture of what people think of its condition now. If you want to know if renovations are planned between now and September, you should ask hotel. It is in a good location, on a relatively quiet and interesting block of W 44 street between 5th and 6th Avenues. There are several historic private clubs and hotels on that block. It is a convenient location. The Marquis is about 35 years old and right on Times Square, so there will be a lot more people on the street -- also probably more people milling about in the hotel, as they do a lot of big business meetings in that hotel (though not so likely this year as many have been cancelled). It would help to know how many in your party, whether you\\'ve been here before, what\\'s important to you in a hotel (view? Space? Service?) and what plans you have. First timers are often told to stay near Times Square but this is not really necessary unless you plan on a lot of theater or have business in that area. Also, would you use Marriott points? Status doesn\\'t get you much in perks in NYC.\\nMarquis rooms are relatively large forNYC and have floor to ceiling windows...most rooms have views. The downside is it\\'s large and service is spotty. Just me and my wife. We have been to NYC before, I will be working 3 days of the 4 during 9 to 5 remotely from the hotel. We have been to Times Square, Statue of Liberty, One World Center, 9/11 Memorial, Central Park we have visited part of it.\\nThis time we will visit Central Park again and other areas.\\nI will not be using Marriott points. Do you know what your wife plans to do while you\\'re working? Might be helpful to stay near that. Also, you might want to consider a suite so you\\'d have 2 rooms. Btw, I\\'m not seeing the Sofitel for your dates at the price you mention. It\\'s much higher unless you have corporate rates. She will do window shopping, relax, chill, grab coffee, etc. We will be finishing a 3 week road trip and then be in NYC for 4 nights before we fly out back to India. We will grab lunches nearby and go out in evening/night time.\\nSingle room should be fine, but we need at least 300+ sq ft as we will have 4 bags minimum.\\nSofitel is 1875 USD for 4 nights through their website with free cancellation and 1613 USD non-refundable. Does that include taxes and fees?\\nI would not say there\\'s the best window shopping near either of those hotels. The rooms at the Affinia 50 are large. You can even get a 1 bedroom suite with terrace for about the same price as you quote for the Aofitel with all fees. They\\'re running a buy 3 nights get the fourth free on their website. It\\'s walking distance to Saks Fifth Ave., , Bloomingdales and other shops that are near those a d easy walk to the south end of Central Park.\\nIf you prefer something more modern and boutique-y, the Mondrian Park Ave. premier king room is 375 sf with a seating area and ~$1700 with taxes and resort fee. Includes buffet breakfast I believe. It\\'s in the area called Nomad just north of Madison Square Park.\\nAs a woman with interest in window shopping, strolling and poking around, either of these would preferable to me vs the 2 you picked. I would not stay in or near Times Square on this trip. There have been some incidents in the area around Port Authority which is a few blocks southwest of the Marriott. Between the 2 you picked, the room will be nicer at the Marriott but the Sofitel is a less frenetic location. I like Sofitel hotels for the most part. I would go with it unless a better hotel. Thanks, we are looking at the Mondrian too now. Kumar, they\\'re saying we will restrict incoming people from India starting May 4 because of the pandemic. Hopefully this will change before your trip, but just wanted to give you a heads up.\\nhttps://in.usembassy.gov/covid-19-information/\\nAs for hotel choice, the Mandarin Oriental is in a great location but VERY expensive (over $1000/night!). I think there are better choices that are not so pricey. The Dominick in Soho (good area for shops and restaurants) has large rooms, views and can be had for less than half the price.\\nEdited: 3:32 pm, May 01, 2021 Yea hopefully it will be back to normal by August.\\nI meant looking at Mondrian park Avenue hotel.\\nHow is the area around the Conrad? Completely subject to change as we go but have I got things in the right area at the right time?\\nDay 1 - arrive and check in @ Approx 2.30 pm. Freehand Hotel. Flatiron Building, Time Square and then either TOTR or ESB.\\nDay 2 - Grand central, Bryant Park and the Library, St Patrick’s Cathedral.\\nDay 3 - SOL in the morning and then 9/11 in the afternoon. Hopefully also, charging bull, sea glass carousel and ghostbusters building.\\nDay 4 - Central Park, cocktail at the Plaza, Trump Tower (likely just a walk past), the Met (family not keen but I’d like an hour or so) then either TOTR or ESB depending on what we saw day 1.\\nDay 5 - Jersey Gardens.\\nDay 6 - Wall Street, Stone Street, Brooklyn Bridge/DUMBO and Staten Island Ferry at night.\\nDay 7 - Intrepid and Helicopter (helicopter not 100% set on).\\nDay 8 - check out. Flight back to UK from Newark at 20.20. Plan to leave hotel at 16.30. Take the day as it comes but a good late lunch before we go. When is this for? Could sway you one way or the other for either TOTR or ESB on your first evening. You\\'d want to have TOTR for when you get at least some daylight views so you can see Central Park.\\nDay 2 is light. You could easily add something else to this day as well. If it were me, I would add hanging out in one of the lovely neighborhood areas that you don\\'t have included as it is now. Greenwich Village is a good choice for this, particularly on a nice day you could spend some time in Washington Square Park and walk around along the lovely streets in the area. There are other areas too.\\nIf the family isn\\'t keen on the Met museum, you could always split up and do different things for a bit of the day?\\nDay 3, are you doing the 9/11 museum or just the memorial?\\nEdited: 12:20 pm, May 16, 2021 Thank you. This is really helpful. I’ll look at day 2 and see what else we can add in.\\nDefinitely the memorial. I don’t want to do the museum so it may be, on this day, that we split up and I can head to the Met for a few hours myself. Or perhaps walk to the Oculus.\\nWe have jus rebooked our trip and are now 2-9 April 2022 which seems a lifetime away. The Oculus is right by the memorial, so that can easily be seen without a long walk. Just asked, since the 9/11 museum would be quite time consuming. If you want to see the memorial, but won\\'t visit the museum, then you could possibly add Wall Street and Stone Street parts to this day since it\\'s in the same general area. Depending on how tired you are, you could possibly walk the Brooklyn Bridge as well. You could decide this on the same day, when you know how worn out you are after the firts parts of the day - and leave the Brooklyn Bridge / DUMBO part to where you already have it. You could also add walking the Brooklyn Heights promenade to day 6 - particularly if you\\'ve already seen Wall Street / Ston Street and the Financial District area things on your intinerary.\\nThese changes could of course be done \\'on the day\\' on day 3 when you see and feel how much energy you have left. I\\'m not against splitting these things up. on two days like you have - interesting historic area with lots to see. But it could also be tweaked into one day, depending on your level of energy and stamina (I like keeping these things somewhat open ended myself since I know my own stamina varies from day to day). Forgot to add. I would keep the Met Museum for the day you have planned it, even if you do decide to split up and do different things. It makes sense location wise in combination with the other things you\\'ve planned for that day. Thanks again. This is great information. Day 2 is light, you can do more that day. April is a nice time for walking, here are some really good self guided walking tours, might help with planning:\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html\\nMost of us here will not recommend a helicopter ride for many reasons. That day 7 is light regardless. I recommend a Circle Line full island cruise. It couples well with the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and will give you a perspective from the water. I know the helicopter provides spectacular views, but a harbor cruise is really enjoyable on a nice day.\\nI would not recommend paying money to get transported to outlets in NJ, but that\\'s me. There is so much great shopping in the city, at any price point, and you can do that while out and about. Thank you and noted about the helicopter trip. Ditch the helicopter ride and Jersey Gardens. The rest sounds good. I personally would change the helicopter for a sunset cruise which has a pier next to the Intrepid. +1 for preferring a cruise over a helicopter ride. Much safer, and better value for (my) money. Circle Line Harbor line might be the best option, like Andy says, because of proximity to Intrepid where you\\'ve been before. A full island cruise is a good idea - you\\'ll see some things in the northern parts of Manhattan that you wouldn\\'t see ottherwise (most likely) with such a short visit.\\nIf you want lunch in between, finding someplace in Chelsea could be an option and then take Classic Harbor Line cruise from Chelsea piers instead. I really like their architecture cruises. Smaller boats too. But I\\'ve been taking cruises with both companies and both are fine. https://www.nycgo.com/articles/staycation-guides-staten-island\\nLots of good things mentioned in that. Staten Island is more than just a return trip on the ferry from Manhattan.\\nEmpire Outlets for shopping instead of leaving the city for others.\\nSnug Harbor and Alice Austen House for gardens and history.\\nBeaches and the Greenbelt for the outdoors.\\nThe bus and train network can get you around to most of these sights. I had done a few trip reports from Staten Island\\nthis is what I would recommend\\nFort Wadsworth/Alice Austen House (They are about a mile apart)\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBbwVEaFdu-/\\nSnug Harbor , That Article told people to walk from ferry terminal, while its possible, its 2.5 Miles\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBbxh28Fe2B/\\nRichmondtown 17th and 18th Century Buildings\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CMav2oyLPMU/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CMavZ8jrVmy/\\nConfernce House Park\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBcDXfXluTS/\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CBcDnMglpp9/ I\\'m waiting for the Seguine Mansion to reopen, then I\\'d like to take in some of the other highlights that Howard has chronicled.\\nAs Howard did these sites with a car, I think a lot of tourists skip them because it\\'s not as convenient when relying on public transportation. I have a car, so I\\'m not even considering using public transportation. I find the Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island fascinating - more haunting in its way than Brooklyn’s Green-Wood.\\nAlso, it’s impossible to overstate how great SI’s parks are...the one place in NYC where you can almost count on seeing deer (an interest of international visitors, don’t ask me why) and seals.\\nAlso also: Sri Lankan food! And lots of intriguing Mexican places I haven’t (yet) tried. I was surprised recently to see one offering “comida corrida,” something that I’d never seen in a NYC restaurant. In general visiting many sites in the outer boroughs requires using a bus , Uber or a car. Even the Unisphere in Queens is almost a mile from the nearest Subway Station, Brooklyn Bridge park in Dumbo isnt so close to the Subway either (Like a mile).\\neveryone thinks the subway goes everyone, It doesnt unfortunatly Yea not everywhere in the city is super convenient with mass transit. The other day I had to go out to Hunt\\'s Point and while I considered taking the subway and then a bus I ended up just taking a car. It was going to be quite a long ride with mass transit, although the traffic was miserable on the Bruckner.\\nEdited: 12:17 am, May 16, 2021 Nice pictures again Howard.\\nStaten Island is an underrated option for tourists. As many have said there’s a lot to see and a few good good spots.\\nEdited: 3:26 am, May 16, 2021 Id say 80-90% of tourists dont leave Manhattan except for Dumbo in Brooklyn (MAYBE Coney Island) , Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, Staten Island Ferry and Airport/Hotel in Queens (MAYBE a mets Game or US Open) and of those that only go to Manhattan, they rarely go above 86th St in Manhattan, Certainly missing Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters ***Id say 80-90% of tourists dont leave Manhattan except for Dumbo in Brooklyn (MAYBE Coney Island) , Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, Staten Island Ferry and Airport/Hotel in Queens (MAYBE a mets Game or US Open) and of those that only go to Manhattan, they rarely go above 86th St in Manhattan, Certainly missing Fort Tryon Park and the Cloisters***\\nI agree with you Howard, there is so much for tourists to see in Manhattan. We see it here when tourists come back multiple times, that\\'s when they typically want to start exploring other boroughs, etc. Yes, but even when they want to go to another borough it\\'s usually Brooklyn first then Queens and after that maybe the Bronx with Staten Island usually last.\\nThere\\'s a lot to see in all of the boroughs. Brooklyn and Queens are probably the easiest to get around. Just jump on the subway and most things are within reach. Bronx is OK depending on where you want to go, things like the Botanic Gardens and Wave Hill / Van Cortlandt House are not as straightforward. Staten Island is the hardest to get around if you don\\'t have a car. I have a new trip report to brooklyn, I just need a few days to Upload the pictures to Instagram (It can be a pain to do so)\\nBotanical Gardens in the Bronx is easy to get to via public transport, Metro North Goes there , its not a big deal.\\nVan Cortlant Park/House is also easy to get to, you just take the #1 train to the last stop, That is Van cortland Park, Wave Hill is a little tricker, but there normally is a shuttle from the Subway , but its not operating now due to covid Any recommendations for a food tour in Chinatown and Little Italy? Ziggy a regular poster did food tours before covid, Im not sure if he will be doing them again, but if he does, you want to join his tour Ziggy has a note on his site that he,s not doing tours this year.\\nEatingwithziggy.com\\nThe company that comes up most often on a current google search is Ahoy Food tours but I know nothing about them Maybe with the city opening up, He will change his mind, I have no idea if he just gave up the busienss due to no customers I had emailed with Ziggy. He said he has moved on with other opportunities, so most likely not doing tours again. I hope that if he changes his mind he posts here. Ziggy\\'s tours were good but he never did tours of Manhattan Chinatown and Little Italy. It\\'s a sad end of an era for Ziggy\\'s tours. Hopefully one day he\\'ll be back at it. And his food recommendations have been my favourites over the years. Follow him on social media as he\\'s still posting things.\\nFree Tours by Foot have several food tours, Chinatown and Little Italy is one. Note that they\\'re not technically \"free\", they\\'re name-your-own-price plus the cost of any food you buy.\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/new-york-tours/food-tours/free-chinatown-food-tour/ On my first trip to NYC, I fondly remember buying warm chopped coconut and cashews. On my second trip to NYC, I remember buying a simple but heavenly cup of coffee from a small cart on the way to a museum.\\nI am looking forward to buying maybe a halal chicken plate, or some Nigerian or Ethiopian food.\\nWhat was your favorite food cart experience? Need more material for the Blog? Good one Howard.\\nI do not eat from food carts. I find them disgusting and don\\'t believe they\\'re clean, how do the employees wash their hands, go to the bathroom, and so on.\\nAs far as the halal food carts, I don\\'t know if those are the same Halal Guys that is a national chain. They have a few brick and mortar locations here in the city. Maybe the street cart is alluring to tourists, I don\\'t know. Hi SpringerAndy, I’m not sure if they are the same as The Halal Guys. I thought they were and went to try them when they came to a nearby city and was so disappointed. The meat quality was so bad and the interest died down after a month or two. :( Hi Howard, again I’m not writing for a blog. There are far too many travel blogs out there and video blogs are more interesting nowadays. I plan to take video on my trip, but just to show loved ones that haven’t been to NYC. I might upload some of the videos to YouTube if the quality is good enough. I love food carts and get food from them & various outdoor vendors fairly often (so much so that the guy who sells tamales & champurrado out of picnic coolers by the church on the corner knows me). But I’m not sure I have a favorite experience. A few do stand out:\\nThe dosa guy on the south side of Washington Square...not sure if he’s still there, this is a memory from years ago. Some woman had an embarrassingly obvious crush on him and was always trying to help with his cart. He generally ignored her. It was a bit painful to watch, but also, I have to admit, funny. Who knew food carts had groupies?\\nGetting Filipino food from a food cart near NYU hospital while my husband had (minor) surgery. With so many Filipino health care workers in the area, I figured it would be good, and it was. The problem was that the intriguing soup/stew I ordered turned out to be enough to feed a family for several days, and so I had to carry the leftovers with me through the whole pick-up and discharge and taxi home process.\\nDiscovering that what I thought would be a simple agua fresca de melón from a stand in Sunset Park also involved melon granita for extra deliciousness.\\nThe kind & funny guys at the King of Falafel cart at Park and 53rd, always generous with samples when the line gets long, always kidding me:\\nMe - I’d like a falafel sandwich with tahini, a little hot sauce, and extra pickles, please.\\nGuy - Ok, one falafel with extra hot sauce and no pickles.\\nMe, panicked - No, I wanted...\\nGuy - cracks up\\nBTW, I don’t think you’ll find Ethiopian or Nigerian food carts - those aren’t big communities here, I’ve never seen carts featuring those cuisines. I\\'m not a huge fan of food carts, like Linda is (the undisputed expert on TA NYC forum), but the one I do really enjoy and rely on is Sam\\'s, a vegetarian falafel truck, in Zuccotti Park, weekdays only, until 4. I haven\\'t seen him in a looooong time, Covid related, I\\'m sure. Such a kind sweet man, and clean, to my eye. I hope he\\'s back soon. Also, I usually get the \"platter\" instead of the sandwich, it\\'s a dollar or two more, but lasts two meals. Comes with pita. I think the sandwich is $5 and the platter is $7. There are other falafel guys in that area, but if Sam isn\\'t there, I\\'m headed to Taim or Nish Nush. I am with Springer, The only think I will buy from a food cart is a SEALED can of Soda, I do not trust the hygine or food safety and frankly I am opposed to churro ladies for the same reason, you have no idea what the hygine of the kitches these items were made in Will visit in August and wondering which museums are reopened? Whitney? MoMA? Neue Gallery? Please and Thank you! All Museums are open, they have been open since last Sept Any news about museums returning to their old hours? It looks like a lot of museums have reduced hours or are closed on additional days. Whitney and MoMA are open. Neue reopens June 10. All require timed tickets purchased in advance. Check their websites and the websites of other museums and places you are interested in visiting As of now, many museums are open only on a timed-ticket/appointment basis. It\\'s best to check each individually to see what their rules are. This may change by August. You might want to keep checking the ones you wish to visit to see if timed tickets are required. Don\\'t count on all museums being open and you should book as the entires are timed. I recently looked up the National Museum of Mathematics and it is still closed. Museum of Natural History is open, but you must register for a time online. Others, like the Tenement Museum have more limited hours and has requirements for vaccination or a recent Covid test. Best bet is to keep watching the museum websites. Going to NYC week of Christmas. Lotte is a little more expensive. Which would we enjoy more....adult with two 17 year olds? Really want to enjoy the Christmas atmosphere. Thanks The Lotte Palace is noted for its elaborate Christmas decorations inside and outside. If you want atmosphere, it\\'s the hotel to book The Palace is also only a block or two from Rockefeller Center, the Christmas tree , and the Rockettes.\\nNote the Grand Hyatt is due to be torn down within a year or two. If they are giving you a quote for Christmas, then they must plan to be open then, at least for now, but that does add an element of uncertainty. My vote also would be for the Lotte Palace. While no definite date has been announced, several websites mention late 2022 or 2023 as the closing of the Grand Hyatt. This was one of several railroad hotels constructed in the early 20th century in connection with Grand Central Terminal. On Madison Ave., the Biltmore was replaced with an office building. Also, the Roosevelt recently closed prompted by new zoning in the area that allows larger buildings. There are lots of hotels in NYC. Why only these 2? If these are the only options, the Palace is the clear winner with big rooms, views on higher floors, great xmas decor and a wow lobby. Thanks. I booked the Lotte Palace! Re #4 Yes. Before the pandemic some sources said the Grand Hyatt might come down as early as late 2020, but the pandemic changed all that.\\nThe real estate sub. of the old New York Central Railroad developed and originally owned the Biltmore, the Roosevelt and the Commodore (what Grand Hyatt was called before covered in glass by a young Donald Trump), all to help promote their RR business. Likewise, I assume Hotel Pennsylvania was likely developed by old Pennsylvania Railroad to support its business out of Penn Station. I booked our hotel for our family of 4 at this hotel. It seems there are some fake good reviews on this website for the hotel but I booked based on location. I really wanted a more low key area and am having second thoughts. Our room rate was 200/night plus the daily resort fee. Can anyone recommend a good clean hotel in more of a neighborhood area with restaurants? It is our first time in NYC and we are not super touristy people - To get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport and 4) hotel budget. We are arriving at 9:30pm on 6/11 and thinking of staying 2 or 3 nights in NYC. We want to see the city, but we will be heading to Boston and Portland on this trip and I\\'m honestly not super excited about noisy and crowded New York with a family of 5 (ages 6, 16, 21, and two middle age parents). Is it crazy to think of getting from JFK to Midtown or that vicinity that late at night? Would it be better to stay close to the airport the first night and then book a hotel in the city the next night? Our budget is around 200 night because of all the extra fees.\\nEdited: 11:19 am, May 15, 2021 No, go to Manhattan. I suggest taking a taxi as well.\\nDon\\'t forget that the hotel tax adds nearly 15% to your nightly total as well.\\nStay longer, 3 to 4 nights if you can. Is the Park Central Hotel a decent hotel? Any suggestions on a hotel for 5 people? Ages 6, 16, 21, and two adults? There is a flat taxi fare from JFK to Manhattan --\\nI definitely think too you should just get into the city to get settled instead of staying out near the airport.\\nhttps://www.jfkairport.com/to-from-airport/taxi-car-and-van-service -\\nWhile NYC is getting more visitors and people are out and about, I don\\'t think we are going to have the sort of crowds yet that you may be thinking - Hard to know just now but, I would be surprised Your 21 year old is an adult, and your 16 year old probably is too as far as hotels are concerned. You will have difficulty finding one room that accommodates 4 adults and a child, especially for $200. I have never stopped at the park central hotel. From the reviews and ratings it looks a very decent hotel in a very nice part and busy part of Manhattan , near Central Park.\\nAs a McCat says # 5.Manhattan is not as busy as it used to be and that it’s hard to know what you will encounter.\\nNY destinations expert NYwhiz did mention on your other thread, how getting a room for five people isnt as easy as finding a room one for 2 . And especially to find one in within budget.\\nI suggest to you that if you are willing to pay the rate, even with the added resort fees @ Park Central you should keep it.\\nYou could continue looking but I would not cancel that reservation until I found something much better, In a more quiet location and that was cheaper.\\nIf I were in your situation, with 3 kids, I would budget a taxi ride on the late night nightarrival , get into the city, settle and stay in Manhattan the three nights.\\nI Know 4 people can ride in a taxi, 5 uses a Minivan. Look at the the link on Taxi info in post 5 .\\nEdited: 1:28 pm, May 15, 2021 The Park Central has been our hotel of choice for years when visiting New York City for business or pleasure; there are plenty of restaurants to choose from in the immediate area, and your walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, the theatre district and midtown attractions. Resort fees cover the costs of different amenities included in your stay — Fitness Roon, Pay Per View Movies, etc., some packages included WiFi or free bicycle rentals in Central Park. Will you be taking advantage of these? Only you can decide the worth for your stay. Discounts are also available through the concierge for different restaurants, museums and tours. Compare with what’s offered at other hotels and see what works for you! Also take a look at the Riu Plaza Times Square they have family rooms available to accommodate 5, and there fees include use of the Fitness Room, WiFi and Breakfast. I mentioned 2 hotels in your original thread, the Residence Inn Downtown and Sohotel.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13548035-Where_to_stay-New_York_City_New_York.html#109936471\\nThe Park Central imo is “ok” but that hefty $40/night resort fee plus tax makes it no bargain IMO. Make sure you,re comparing apples to apples on price. $200/night for 5 people is unrealistic given that not many hotels have 1 room that sleeps 5. The Courtyard Midtown East has rooms with 2 queen beds and a sofabed but may be more expensive.\\nEdited: 3:42 pm, May 15, 2021 I’ll be travelling back to UK in a couple of weeks and am completely confused by Foreign Office advice on the test needed in the USA 72 hours before boarding (the regulations after landing are clear - it costs a lot!).\\nCan anyone point me in the right direction on location and cost - thanks in advance. Long Island is pretty big. Could you be more specific as to where you are looking? Hi everyone!\\nMy wife and I have booked Thanksgiving (fingers crossed it happens) and we\\'re staying at The Archer. We normally stay more in Hells Kitchen but we love this area and the hotel looks awesome.\\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for somewhere to have breakfast that\\'s not too far from the hotel? Not after anything fancy; just in an out and full! With Covid and restaurants still closed or restricted, it\\'s a bit early to really know what will be open in November. Check back in 4-5 months and we\\'ll have a better idea what is still operating. So many places are gone. Try Pershing Square Cafe or if you want something on the go then the food hall in GCT is very good. Maison Kayser on W40th is currently closed, but if it\\'s open when you come, it\\'s a quick walk from your hotel and right by Bryant Park/NYPL. To the best of my knowledge, Maison Kayser filed for bankruptcy and all branches remain closed. Actually, a couple in my neighborhood seem to have recently transitioned from \"closed\" to \"for rent.\" Unlike the case with also bankrupt Pain Quotidien, where someone was found to take over some of the more profitable outlets, I don\\'t think anyone could be found to take over some or all of Maison Kayser, which is sad.\\nFor a real diner in the Bryant Park neighborhood, I think you should head west, like towards Seventh Av/Bway, to what remains of Garment District.\\nAlso, I would not recommend going to food hall of GCT over Thanksgiving weekend. Maybe week before or after.\\nHas Pershing Square reopened?\\nEdited: 7:09 pm, May 10, 2021 Maison Kayser went bankrupt. The NY locations are closed and were bought by a company that is going to convert at least some of them to Le Pain Quotidien -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

The location is across the street from Madison Square Garden and the entrance to Penn Station, one of the busiest travel hubs in New York. It is very close to several subways. It\\'s a couple of blocks from Macy\\'s. As far as restaurants go, Keen\\'s Steakhouse is nearby, and there used to be a lot of fast food and take out places nearby, but since the pandemic, I really don\\'t know how many are open/survived.\\nIt\\'s a very commercial area. It wouldn\\'t be my choice because it is (or at least it was, pre-pandemic) very noisy around there -- I prefer better proximity to a park and fewer retail establishments.\\nYou might want to invest in a good tourist\\'s map. One that I love is the Red Map:\\nhttps://redmaps.com/products/nyc-manhattan-neighborhood-travel-map Thanks a lot even after reading so many reviews I was a bit hesitant , thank you it helped a lot I stayed there with my husband and 2 children (10 & 7) pre covid (2018).\\nWe liked the location as it was very close to the subway. Definitely not the prettiest location but certainly convenient.\\nWe were on the 10th floor and used ear plugs so didn’t hear too much noise.\\nIf I were to go back I’d probably stay in a different location, simply to experience another location.\\nI’d definitely recommend the Stewart if the location was convenient for what you want to do though. Arriving at JFK. Would like to take a subway to RAdisson Hotel near 5th and 51st.\\nCan I do it with just one subway? How long will it take? https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13187699-How_do_I_get_from_the_airport_JFK_LGA_EWR_to_Manhattan-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nHow long the trip will take depends on a number of unpredictable circumstances.\\nEdited: 9:04 pm, May 15, 2021 Roughly 50 to 60 minutes. Take the air train to subway and then take E train to 53rd and Fifth. Be sure to take the AirTrain going to Jamaica and not the one to Howard Beach. On your return, you want to get off the E train at Sutphin Blvd./JFK for the AirTrain. Do not stay on the E train to the last stop, Jamaica Center. Hi, we lived in NY years ago, but will be taking the kids (7 & 9) for the first time this summer (I know not best timing but it is what it is). We are going to do all the corny touristy things. Had originally planned on staying in Times Square, but not since things aren\\'t fully open, not sure if that is the best right now? Thoughts, suggestions?\\n(FYI, we will be staying at a Marriott property, but are open to specific suggestions)\\nThanks! The Residence Inn Downtown / World Trade Center has good-sized rooms which might be nice for a family of your size. They have kitchenettes in all rooms too if you want to store some snacks and such. Near all the downtown touristy things. I wouldn’t stay in Times Square at the best of times, and definitely not with kids. The Residence Inn mentioned above is very good. We also like the Residence Inn Manhattan Times Square. It’s actually adjacent to Bryant Park. Both have great access to multiple subway routes. Courtyard Central Park and Residence Inn Central Park (both in the same building, the Residence Inn is on the higher floors) are both just north of TS but walkable to there, plus walkable to other midtown sights (Rockefeller Center and TOTR for example) and up to Central Park. It\\'s a handy location without being in the middle of the TS madness (such as it is now).\\nThey are both Marriott properties. -Typical tourist sites are spread out so no one location is going to be near everything. The major sites are in midtown (which includes Times Square) and the financial district. Those 2 areas are about 20-30 mins away from each other by subway.\\n-Most first time visitors stay in midtown and many are convinced they must be in/near Times Square which is not true.\\n-Being near a subway stop is important. Being near multiple subway lines is even better.\\n-Google maps shows subway stops with a blue \"m\"\\nMaps.google.com\\nI would look at all the Marriott hotels and see which are cheapest for your dates and which have the most space. Most NYC hotel rooms for 4 will only have 2 double beds. The only Marriott property I can recall that has 2 queens is the Residence Inn Downtown in the financial district which puts you near some parks, ferries and it,s nice and breezy down there. While I love the location,of the 2 Aynat mentions near Central Park, they only have 2 double beds. Thanks for a few tips, please note as stated in OP that we used to live there and are familiar with locations and subways.\\nWe think the kids would enjoy times Square in the best of times, but not sure if it will be as full of life and if their were a better location that would be more fun for them, still with easy access to food that doesn\\'t close up after work...as I remember things in the financial district. The Financial District is different than what you remember. It\\'s become more of a residential area and many families live down there. Plenty of dining and Tribeca isn\\'t far.\\nhttps://mommypoppins.com/new-york-city-kids/best-of-lists/30-fun-things-to-do-in-the-financial-district-with-kids-museums Would look for a place closer to central park. There is likely to be much more going on in central park than times square. There are still plenty of people in times square but it is not like it was pre-pandemic where it was wall to wall people, because it is missing all the broadway crowds. You can just take them through one night to see the lights, but if it is hot out you may be more inclined to duck into the park where there is shade than wander the city streets and there should be lots there that would amuse them. Can also be closer to the museums like natural history museum and MET if those are on your itinerary and food will likely be less expensive than the places in times square. Trying to decide between a Family Terrace Suite at the New Yorker or a junior queen suite at Fifty hotel and suites and wondering if anyone has stayed at both / seen both lately. 2 adults 3 kids for one week. I used to live in NYC so know area etc but kids haven’t been since they were babies. Thought the New Yorker as has terrace and room has city views but the other hotel looks a little more updated . Thoughts??? Thanks in advance The area around the New Yorker (Penn station) is not very attractive. Yes, Affinia 50 is more updated and they do have 1 bedroom suites but probably more than you want to spend. Affinia Shelburne is another option. Personally I wouldn\\'t want to stay at the New Yorker, but many like the Art Deco decor. I don\\'t know how many beds you get at each. I think space and number of beds is more important than the terrace, but you may not agree. Remember both charge a daily resort fee. The Affinia hotels have a,promotion of buy 2 nights get a 3rd free. That might bring down your rate.\\nEdited: 3:51 pm, May 15, 2021 I would prefer the Fifty too in terms of style and a quieter location. And I used to think that a terrace would be nice but the traffic noise and car horns, wind, and general city noise makes it not as pleasant as I had hoped (at another hotel).\\nBut the New Yorker has many more subway lines closer. The A,C,E trains are right out the door. That\\'s a big plus. Hi, I have been to newyork several times but am going now after 20 years and that too in covid, please help me choose the hotel clean and safe ,it’s my daughters first time we will be arriving at JFK, will walk newyork basically , also please tell me what’s the best economical way from the airport to the hotel , are shared shuttles on now because we don’t want to use the subway with suitcases in our hands , hotel recommendations of holiday inn express calibre would be highly appreciated\\nThanks in advance What is your budget in USD for a hotel?\\nWhat are your dates? As hotel prices vary by date quite a bit.\\nHow may beds do you need? One or two?\\nWith this information the NYC travel experts can more accurately help with the hotel search. Ist week of June double room with twin beds , and budget can go around 150 usd , I need a safe and clean hotel close to subway so mobility isn’t a problem If you want near central park then look at places in midtown like in the 50s, midtown east, Hell\\'s kitchen and the upper west side. These areas would put you within walking distance of the park. The upper east side doesn\\'t have many affordable lodging options. If you\\'re staying for at least 4 nights the Courtyard Central Park has a double room for $169 p/n ex taxes on their Stay More rate, which isn\\'t bad.\\nThat hotel is just south of Central Park on 54th St making it easily walkable to midtown sights as well as up to Central Park and west to Hell\\'s Kitchen for eating.\\nhttps://www.marriott.com.au/hotels/travel/nycpk-courtyard-new-york-manhattan-central-park/\\nAlso look at something like Expedia which may have it cheaper than that. Country yard Marriott seems nice but it doesn’t say if 4 days the rate would be discounted, I will be staying for 7 days When you put in your dates of stay, number of guests etc, then click on View Rates, a couple of rates come up. One of them should be the Long Term rate (they used to call it the Stay More rate). This appears under the Deal and Packages tab rather than the Standard Rates tab.\\nAll of this appears when you have put in your dates, guests etc and click on View Rates. I keep reading on various posts what people are watching right now to pass the time. I am personally looking for anything that is showing contemporary New York until I can get there again.\\nMy personal favorite is God Friended Me and I\\'ve already watched all the Gossip Girls, Sex and the City (more than once) and Younger.\\nAny suggestion to help me get my \"fix\"? Two shows that I\\'ve watched and enjoyed within the last year that showcase NYC are Russian Doll and Broad City.\\nRussian Doll is a dark comedy created by Natasha Lyonne, Leslye Headland, and Amy Poehler (I\\'m a massive fan of Poehler\\'s). It was mostly filmed in the East Village and Lower East Side. The show is on Netflix.\\nBroad City is comedy show, which finished it\\'s fifth and final season last year. Each season has 10 episodes, which are about 30 minutes each, so it\\'s an easy watch. It was created by Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, who met each other in NYC at the Upright Citizens Brigade, an improv and sketch comedy theatre.\\nHaving seen a couple of shows at the Upright Citizens Brigade on my previous trips, I noticed a coupe of the performers I\\'d seen make appearances on the show.\\nTwo episodes of Broad City that spring to mind is one shot entirely on St. Marks Place in the East Village, and another when the ladies decide to do an all-day walk through Manhattan, from the top to the bottom. Good idea for a thread.\\nWhite Collar gives lots of views of the city. In fact I didn’t know about the Roosevelt Island Tramway until I watched an episode which showed them riding it.\\nAm currently watching Suits but there are many seasons of both.\\nI will most likely be watching Peppa flippin Pig and Frozen for the foreseeable future, the kids schools/college are closed from this afternoon, gulp! @emskii - I have watched Russian Doll, is there a season 2? I will definitely look into Broad City especially as I really do like Ilana Glazer and have been meaning to go to the Upright Citizens Brigade for quite a while.\\n@jofar - I\\'ve watched White Collar and had the privilege of meeting Matt Bomer at the stage door for The Boys in the Band (which I believe they are doing for television). Suits is actually filmed in Toronto, Canada. I also love the Bold Type which is set in New YOrk, but filmed in Montreal (actually watching now). @jcmtl1965 Netflix did announce that there would be a Season 2 of Russian Doll, but no release date yet. Thanks emskii, will be looking out for it. The Amazon eight-part series \"Modern Love\" is taken from the NY Times column of the same name and is set in the city. One reason I liked it was for all the Brooklyn scenes near the area where my daughter and grandson used to live. I also liked the series just for the stories. @CBATFS - you are absolutely right about Modern Love. This is how I found the Elizabeth garden which I will definitely be visiting during my next trip. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt? https://www.netflix.com/title/80025384 Have you seen The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel? Granted it\\'s set in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s in NYC, but I love the nostaglia of it, and the show is absolutely hilarious!\\nThere are two fabulous seasons on Amazon Prime you can binge watch through. +1 #6\\nModern Love\\nBased on the NYtimes column.\\nLots of scenes of neighborhoods in NYC, and really good, Loved the first episode, and the others too.\\nAnd +1 #9 (our old friend teacher 91... Back again!)\\nMaisel.\\nSeinfeld!...so New York. I\\'d like to add more ferry travels this time around. I thought it\\'d be neat to take the ferry from Pier 11 to North Williamsburg and walk from there to Grand Ferry Park and Domino Park & back. I\\'d walk Kent Ave to Grand and then walk along River St. I\\'ve been to the Smorgasburg a few years ago via the ferry. I watched a live walking tour last night where they said there are areas in Brooklyn one should avoid. I don\\'t feel this is that area, it appears to look pretty safe...am I correct?\\nTIA You\\'ll reach Domino Park in 10-15 minutes from the ferry using Kent Street. It\\'s a safe, easy walk. Totally safe and a pleasant walk.\\n(Boo hiss for the guide in question...saying there are areas of the boroughs that should be avoided is a pet peeve of mine; perceptions of safety are situational and personal, what seems safe and fun to one person might seem dangerous or unpleasant to another, so blanket admonitions aren’t helpful. Good on you for following up!) This area is perfectly fine and it is a short walk. There are certainly sections of the boroughs that should be avoided. Most of them are not areas most tourists would be drawn to. If it helps, I\\'ve walked from downtown Brooklyn to Williamsburg restaurants meeting friends & family for years and happen to be a fan of Dumont Burgers. In 2012, I walked from Sheraton Hotel downtown to the restaurant to meet people one night when Hurricane Sandy hit New York.\\nBeing younger (and dumber), I decided a little rain & wind wasn\\'t going to hurt me. And I took a taxi back to the hotel after dinner. Friends were having a Midnight Hurricane party, but I passed. I\\'d rather be asleep and comfy in the hotel bed watching Star Wars.\\nWhat stood out was how many people were out & about in restaurants & bars across Williamsburg that evening. Many places were open and people were busting through the doors. You couldn\\'t find seat anywhere, unless you had a reservations. The subways stopped mid-afternoon that day.\\nAll this to say that you\\'ll be just fine walking around Williamsburg and hope you enjoy your trip to New York! ***This area is perfectly fine and it is a short walk. There are certainly sections of the boroughs that should be avoided. Most of them are not areas most tourists would be drawn to.***\\nFully agree with the above statement.\\nThere will be plenty of others out and about as well. >>> There are certainly sections of the boroughs that should be avoided.<<<\\nAvoided by whom, for what reasons, at what times?\\nI used to avoid the areas around Barclays before/after hockey games; other people would love it. On the other hand, I feel totally comfortable doing specific things at specific times of day in neighborhoods that are on many other people’s “avoid” lists.\\nVisitors don’t all come from the same cultural or economic backgrounds, they don’t have the same interests, and different things make them feel safe or threatened. That’s what I meant about vague, blanket admonitions being unhelpful. I\\'m tweaking my final plans for my upcoming trip and am stuck on deciding what to do. The problem with me is when scouting out walking routes I find myself discovering something else to add, and that I have done once again.\\nOn one of my days starting around 8am, I will be taking the ferry from Pier 11 up to the Long Island City stop. I plan on walking the waterfront from one end to the other (Gantry Plaza State Park & Hunter\\'s Point). When done, I\\'ll be taking the ferry over to Roosevelt Island, walking RI from one end to the other and back to the tram over to Manhattan. Are you tired yet? I know it\\'s a lot of walking, but it\\'s what I love and I am so fortunate to have a body that is able to do that.\\nRather than exploring some on foot and hopping on the subway back to the FiDi, I thought I\\'d-\\nA. Walk from the tram down 60th to Park Ave (Christ Church photo op). Down Park Ave (St. Barth\\'s Church photo op) to view of Helmsley Bldg w/ Met Life background (photo op). From there 46th to 3rd Ave down to 44th/3rd intersection for best view of Chrysler Bldg (photo op) and over to United Nations grounds (not sure how close I can get since it\\'s closed), Isaiah\\'s Wall up the stairs to Tudor City Place/bridge (photos). From there I\\'ll make my way down to the East 34th Street Ferry Terminal taking that back to Pier 11.\\nB. Walk from tram up to 90th Street Ferry Terminal taking ferry back to Pier 11. I thought it would be cool to spend the evening at sunset, if sunny, on an hour long route back to Pier 11 resting my feet and taking in the scenery. However, I haven\\'t yet checked out what I may see along the walking route that would interest me. I love street art, old churches, unique architectural styles, sculptures/statues, parks.\\nSo....I\\'d welcome thoughts, suggestions. And any concerns for safety. I love to walk all over when I\\'m in New York, I have walked from Bryant Park to Battery Park. I have walked the entire lenght of Central Park. As the things I like to see are churches, parks and nice buildings, I would go with option A myself. Ive walked the Circumfrance of Roosevelt Island, Its about 3 Miles, its not that much If you decide to go north: You might like seeing Carl Schurz Park near the 90th street ferry. https://www.carlschurzparknyc.org/\\nStores on Madison Ave in the 60s-80e are beautiful. Particularly note the building where Ralph Lauren is at 72nd and Madison.\\nPerhaps you want to check out the schedule at the 92nd St Y in case there’s an interesting program for you.\\nEdited: 4:06 pm, May 14, 2021 If you really want to walk, there is a park called Riverside Park, Its along the Hudson River from about 59th St that goes north along the Hudson River. The Park is almost as nice as Cental Park, but hardly any tourists go there I used to bike riverside park. As you go up north you see things like sail boats on the river. Nice area for viewing sunset. Parts of it are in disrepair. They are investing $348 million into updating it because parts are prone to flooding etc. The church on Park & 50th is known as St Bart\\'s, not St Barth\\'s, and is not related to the island. Full name is St Bartholomew\\'s.\\nYou are unlikely to make it onto UN property, unless they suddenly open up. Note that the UN property is considered international property and is not subject to laws of US or NY, so just because something may be okay across the street doesn\\'t mean it\\'s okay there. IMO it partly depends on if you\\'ve ever explored that part of the UES / Yorkville https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkville,_Manhattan\\nIt\\'s only a couple of miles from the tram up to Carl Shurz\\nThere\\'s a walkway along the East River that might be worth a look https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/arts/east-river-virtual-tour-virus.html and http://www.nyc.gov/html/edc/pdf/greenway_mapside.pdf and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River_Greenway Some architecture you can check out in Yorkville.\\nhttps://6tocelebrate.org/neighborhoods/yorkville/ Yes, the East River walkway is nice...but more so for runners, I think....I don\\'t love being so close to the cars from the FDR for any length of time...when I walk up that way, I usually end up crossing over one of the bridges in the 70s to get away from it. Personal choice, of course. (I used to live in the East 60s...in my mind I walked along the river a lot. In practice, I walked 10-15 blocks and wanted to get away from the noise, but runners love it).\\nRiverside Park is lovely....but doesn\\'t make any sense for the walking tour OP is talking about. It\\'s a long walk cross town just to get there. But a notable spot to visit another time. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

I have seen them not charge tourists.\\nhttps://newyorkdoctorsurgentcare.com/\\nTry City MD also, it is a walk-in\\nhttps://www.citymd.com/urgent-care-locations/ny/manhattan/west-23rd/004 Noted thanks so much I am so fedora of looking through hotels holiday inn express has reviews of being filthy although reachable, Hampton inn doesn’t take cash and Stewart doesn’t pick up kept on hold for 3o mins, I want to pay cash on arrival need a safe and clean place , for 6 nights ,\\nAny recommendations would be appreciated\\nThanks Did you plan on covering for the deposit that most hotels charge in cash as well? The hotel I booked charges $100 deposit per night and a resort fee of 40/day that is not part of the listed price To get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport and 4) hotel budget.\\nAmerican hotels will require a deposit for security / incidentals that is usually done via credit card\\nCarrying significant amounts of cash is a bad idea Aleena-Ray33, you have at least 6 threads open about hotel choices. That makes it hard for people to help you, because they don\\'t know what has already been suggested, considered and dismissed. 25 to 31 may , I am looking at hotel Stewart nyc , called them several times almost giving up , do all the hotels in newyork take deposit per day? If you use a credit card for your deposit you won\\'t actually be charged anything for doing this. It comes into play only if you trash the room before you leave. There will be a \"hold\" on your account for the amount of the deposit but nothing is actually charged to your account.\\nBTW - This is why it\\'s generally a bad idea to use a debit card for this purpose since those funds wouldn\\'t be available to you for use during your visit. Cash would probably be OK at most places, but you\\'d need extra USD for this purpose. Why extra how much extra , I go to San Francisco often they never keep more than a 100 use deposit , I am so disgruntled thinking of changing my holiday venue Many places aren’t set up to take cash in the US.\\nIf you do decide to go elsewhere, try not to start nine threads, so folks can keep better track of your plans and needs, and post all your requirements at once. If you use a site such as booking.com you can reserve a hotel with no prepayment, however, you will need a credit card to make the reservation. Nothing will be taken off the card and pay as you wish when you arrive. Taking into account, as others have mentioned that there is a deposit fee that you will have to give in cash.\\nI believe this could work. Also, when you do such a reservation, you get an email confirmation and a link to contact the property. Also note that you will pay 15% tax on all hotels. Hi, if anyone know of an email for Hampton inn Chelsea , I need to communicate before my booking and there is no contact except for a toll free which I cannot dial from Pakistan\\nThanks This has a phone number - does it not work? https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/nyccshx-hampton-manhattan-chelsea/?SEO_id=GMB-HX-NYCCSHX&y_source=1_MjA4MTk0MC03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24uZ29vZ2xlX3dlYnNpdGVfb3ZlcnJpZGU%3D\\nIn case link doesn\\'t work - The number shown is 212--414-1000 I cannot do a 1800 number from Pakistan is there an email? That is not an 800 number. Most hotels don’t publish email addresses in the US I am on hold since 8 mins An hour or two isn’t uncommon.\\nWe might be able to answer your question if you post it here. They are on Facebook so, if you are on it as well, you might reach them that way - https://www.facebook.com/HamptonInnChelsea/ -- they seem to have a link to messaging them via a link.

Nope it’s a long long hold Were you calling during normal \"business hours\" local time? Hotels like that can go pretty light staff off hours - so tougher to attend to the phone.\\nI just called and was answered within 30 seconds (actually about 10 seconds after their canned welcome message). It seems tales of crime rates isn’t the only thing New York City should be known for. This is heartwarming.\\nhttps://w42st.com/post/gofundme-new-york-state-of-kind/?fbclid=IwAR0IiWiHgjyft0FYQJi8XEkCTTSbwR6sqG_Mvma-zZ3v-E2hxokDjtbexpw New Yorkers arent Mean, they are just Blunt and usually in a rush. Outsiders dont get that and think people are mean Yep. When I hear the words \"kindness\" and \"heartwarming\" New Yorkers just automatically spring to mind. We have gone to sports events all over the country. Wearing our Boston logos. The best conversations I have gotten onto with locals has always been at the NYC venues. What a nice story. Thanks for posting it. “ According to the same release, hundreds of billboards with messages about New Yorkers’ acts of kindness via GoFundMe will “blanket city streets and the subway system” during the month of May. Have you seen them?”\\nI just noticed this part.\\nHas anyone seen them? I haven’t seen it yet. But I’ve been too busy people watching and haven’t looked at billboards. I\\'m glad to see this post reinstated. Howard, I don’t know if this is universal, or just a side effect of being masked, but: New Yorkers are notorious for never looking people in the eye. It’s an oft-noted way to determine if you’re a “real New Yorker”, you’re careful to avoid eye contact. In the last few months, however, I have found myself making eye contact, seeing people look directly at me, holding the gaze, and me them, in ways that I’ve never experienced in a lifetime here. I wonder if it’s the effect of wearing a mask so you don’t need to look away? Maybe people feeling less exposed? I wonder if anyone else has noticed that. AND, I’m writing this on the subway where someone just briefly engaged me in conversation. Change is in the air. I\\'m sure some people are desperate for social contact so will jump at the chance to communicate with others. The not making eye contact thing is how you tell the difference between people who lived in NYC long enough to remember how it was and people who are more recent transplants. When I moved to NYC if you made eye contact with somebody there was a very good chance you were going to have a problem. What a nice article and post\\nI don\\'t live in New York but have given to help with the arts by paying for virtual shows on a regular basis.\\nI\\'ve never had any issue with New Yorkers, they have always been kind to me and I have seen many acts of kindness over my many trips. Hello which SIM card do I get for a week with data ,\\nThanks Jamaica has had the reputation on here of being just a transfer point from the JFK airtrain to the subway system into Manhattan and not somewhere to explore....\\nThis article is great in showing how to explore Jamaica, see it, eat it, explore it, on a weekend. Or pick and choose a couple of things and make a day of it.\\nhttps://www.nycgo.com/articles/a-weekend-exploring-black-owned-jamaica?cid=NYCEM_News_TBE_Int_20210512\\nSome big festivals were held yearly (boo to covid, check if they\\'re on this year), such as the Groovin In the Park Festival (June) and the Jamaican Jerk Festival (July).\\nhttps://www.groovininthepark.com/\\nhttps://jerkfestivalny.com/\\nThe King Manor Museum looks good for a piece of history.

I will go there during the day, But I wouldnt go there at night and maybe Id only go if you were with someone who knew the area Looks nice in the snow!\\nWe\\'ve had questions in the past about Jamaica, and repeat visitors ask where to go that\\'s off the beaten track, or that has a \"local\" feel to visit. I\\'d say Jamaica could be. People can make up their own mind if it suits them. King Manor is like 2 Miles from my house (Doesnt feel like it, as its like a different world, but its really close) I dont recommend going to Jamaica (I dont live in Jamaica) I dont go there either except if I have to take the train there (I did get my covid shots there), I do know where to go and when so Its not bad for me, but I wouldnt recommend people to go there To each his or her own. I have lived in NYC for over forty years. I have been to Jamaica, NY. I would not spend any time there. Yes to Long Island City and Astoria. The Noguchi Museum alone is a gem. There is Plenty in Queens, ive done trip reports about them\\nFlushing\\nForest Hills\\nJackson Heights\\nLong Island City\\nAstoria\\nBayside I only go to Jamaica when I need to go to the courthouse. I suppose the wig stores there might be of some service to me, but I have never considered them. I have a house in Jamaica Estates. Been there since 1980. My exit was the last stop on the F train (180th street) and walk home. Sometimes I use to walk to Jamaica Avenue to grab takeout or eat at the restaurants.\\nI have seen many changes in Jamaica, Queens. The area has improved significantly. However, there is a pause for me to call it tourist destination.\\nThat being said; I would highly recommend Jamaica Queens if you are a foodie (tourist or local alike). I know for me distance does not limit experience when it comes to food. You will find many restaurants with authentic Caribbean foods. Many of which you will not find in Manhattan.\\nTo this day if I want amazing Caribbean food; I head to Jamaica, Queens.\\nI would also highly recommend Jamaica, Queens for the celebrations/parades on Jamaica Avenue (Diwali etc.)\\nBut, for most tourist time may not allow a visit to Jamaica, Queens.\\nEdited: 7:55 am, May 13, 2021 I’m with #8 (just with less local knowledge). I enjoy Baisley Pond Park, which I guess is in South Jamaica, but it’s not easy to get to by public transit and the surrounding area lacks the density to be a good “walking around” destination. I can vouch for the sheer number of West Indian eateries in the Jamaica/Ozone Park area, though! Jamaica Estates is one of the fanciest parts of NYC, there is a reason its called Jamica Estates and not Jamaica. Trump is from there\\nOP mean Jamaica, Jamaica meaning the part from Hillside Ave and South of there. South Jamaica is the part of Jamaica South of the LIRR tracks. While the section between Hillside ave and the LIRR is doable (Thats where King Manor is) Avoid at all costs the section south of the LIRR, that\\'s not good at all Hello, which area is better safty wise , it’s my daughters first time in. Newyork so basically we will see everything from statue of Liberty to Bloomingdales to Macy’s to Empire State to Central Park\\nAlso suggest a 3 star clean and safe hotel\\nThanks Start with Chelsea, and also consider the Flatiron District, Union Square, the Village, etc.\\nWhat is your hotel budget per night, exact dates, and bedding configuration? With that information, the hotel experts can then chime in. Midtown can encompass a large area. Other than the few blocks around port authority midtown is fine. It may not be the most interesting area in terms of restaurants or neighborhood but it is centrally located so it is easier to explore the city from given all the different train options you have. Chelsea is more residential, but depending on where you stay it doesn\\'t have access to as many transit options as you can get in midtown and is not as centrally located which means you may need to transfer trains etc. Given the places you mentioned wanting to visit I would look in midtown or midtown east. Around union square can be another option. Note that many hotels described as being in Chelsea are in fact in midtown south and mere blocks from both Macy\\'s and the Empire State Building. Hi my dates would be 1 June to 8 June , 1 double room with twin beds and budget would be 150 usd per night around , please recommend something in midtown east if transportation is less around Chelsea , holidayinn express comes with breakfast , a chain that’s safe and clean .\\nThanks So i have been to NYC many times but suck at the subway system. Trying to find the 911 museum i ended up in Brooklyn, trying to get the museum of natural history, ended up taking the express and went right past it, etc. (the list goes on).\\nGoal is to not really walk more than 5 miles/day. Trying to sort out which times we should walk, which we should Uber and which we should take the subway. (I know Uber is kind of pricey but I have a $50 gift card so at least the first $50 feels free!)\\nHere\\'s our plan, let me know what you suggest..... please. :-)\\n1sty day:\\nGrand Central to hotel (Park Central hotel)- WALK\\nHotel to Met - UBER\\nWalking a bunch through central park; kids have a list of things they want to see.\\nStrawberry Fields area to Highline - SUBWAY?\\nHighline to Times Square - SUBWAY?\\nTimes Square back to hotel - WALK\\n2nd day:\\nHotel to Statue Cruises - SUBWAY?\\nStatue cruises to Greenwich village with tons of stops for shopping - WALK of course\\nGreenwich village to hotel - UBER OR SUBWAY?\\nHotel to Grand Central - UBER (maybe we\\'ll be tired)\\nWhat do you think? -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 3:49 pm, May 13, 2021\\nEdited: 3:49 pm, May 13, 2021 Your plans seem fine, walking is good when you can, and the subway or Uber is good the rest. Buses are also good for the same price as the subway. You see more from the bus and are good for travelling across Manhattan from East to West when the subway doesn\\'t suit, or anytime really.\\nBut I feel like you didn\\'t understand the subway system last time so you were confused. But really, once you understand some of the basics, you will be a pro in no time and it really is the best and cheapest way to get around.\\nThe basics are train direction (uptown vs downtown), express vs local trains, and station entrances (some are only for uptown or downtown for example).\\nHave you ever taken a look at this subway guide? http://www.nycsubwayguide.com/subway/\\nIt will explain everything about the system, with pictures. Understand the basics and you\\'ll get the rest.\\nGoogle Maps has a good directions feature telling you exactly which train to get (lettered or numbered train) and from which station, or even which bus if you prefer that (click on the Bus option) . Use this and understand the subway system and you\\'ll love it. Use the subway when able. I think that the issue that you may have been having is that there are multiple subway lines that often run on the same track. The NYC system IS NOT color coded. Each subway line is assigned a number or letter, and the color merely refers to a certain segment that the line goes through. When navigating the subway, make sure you are paying attention to the signs pointing to different number/letters and be careful of the number/letter of the train when boarding because multiple train lines may stop on the same platform. Furthermore, make sure you read the info boards hanging above the platforms to figure out which direction the train is going. Thank you so much for all the subway tips; MUCH appreciated!!! \"The NYC system IS NOT color coded.\" For Manhattan the colors tell you the route the trains go. The lines on 8th Avenue are blue; 7th Avenue, red; 6th Avenue, orange; Broadway, yellow; Lexington Avenue, dark green; crosstown lines on 14th Street, gray, and 42nd Street, purple. of course you need to know the number or letter of the train you want because even though they run on the same line some will be express, some will be local, some may terminate at an earlier station than others, other trains may continue on out of the borough. Under the old subway system I think trains were run by different companies and everything was color coded. This was like a long time ago though. Yes, subway is easy once you figured out a few basics. Some of them that I needed to learn beforehand was:\\n* Trains are either numbered or letter. The colors make little sense, they make the subway map easier to read. But if I know where I\\'m going (my end station) the most important thing is to know which number(s) and / or letter(s) the trains have that goes there. If I know this, I don\\'t have to keep track on if a train is local or express. Doesn\\'t matter much for me as a tourist if I take a local instead of express if they both go to the same station - I can spare a few extra minutes when on vacation.\\n* Uptown - downtown. Uptown is north of where you\\'re starting from, downtown is south of where you\\'re starting from. Needed to know so you catch a train in the right direction. If you don\\'t, and make a mistake - happens to me still to this day occasionally - the worst thing that can happen is that you get off and take a train back in the right direction.\\n* There are multiple stations named the same thing. Most often not connected to one another with some exceptions. For example: Chambes street stations (3 o fthem), 23rd street stations, 14 st etc. Make sure you know which station is closest to where you need to go. Some stations with different names are connected though.\\nHere are some links to more info. The info about costs might be outdated, but general basics on how to use them is still valid.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k8012544-Updated_Absolute_Beginner_s_Guide_to_the_NY_Subway-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k4244193-The_Idiot_s_Guide_to_the_Subway_Revised_February_2011-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k6634592-Absolute_Beginner_s_Guide_on_How_to_Use_the_NYC_Subway-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nAlso, the official MTA site is good to have a look at. You can also use Google maps to see which station(s) are close to your hotel, and close to some of the sights you plan to see. I still check Google maps for this frequently when I visit, despite having been several times.\\nhttps://new.mta.info/\\nEdited: 2:16 pm, May 14, 2021 Strawberry Fields to Highline: Take the train that rides along Central Park West, at 72nd St. You can get on any one of them, get off at 14th St and walk west to the Highline and enter around 12th St, walk north to the end. You can walk from there to Times Square if you want.\\nSecond day, to SOL: Take the 1 train Downtown to South Ferry, and then walk. If you want to take the subway to the Village, you can take the 1 again, uptown, and get off, say, at Christopher Street (or the stop before or after). 1 train back up to Hotel.\\nYou can uber crosstown, or take a crosstown bus, or take 1 to Times Square, Shuttle (S) to Grand Central. My daughter wants to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square Central. I don\\'t feel that area is very safe. Am I wrong? What is the safest area for two women traveling together in Aug of this year? TIA I wouldn\\'t choose to stay in or near Times Square right now, but I wouldn’t, call that area unsafe. I just think there are more interesting areas to stay, especially if theater is not open. Why does she want to stay there? When is the trip? Not safe how?\\nit is on a VERY busy street, that goes both directions, most NYC streets are one way, so that could be dangerous, but it\\'s very well located for tourists and as good a neighborhood as you will find in a big city ***Not safe how?***\\nNT: Have you not heard of the recent issues in and around Times Square? Most of those incidents have been mentioned in other threads. All of these issues have been at the forefront of the local news cycle here as well.\\nI agree with nywhiz, I would not stay in or near Times Square right now. Pre-pandemic, I was a very frequent traveler to NYC -- usually a solo traveler. I have never felt unsafe in Times Square or any of its other nearby neighborhoods like the theater district, the 9th Ave. restaurant row, Rockefeller Center, and so forth at any time of day or night because of the crowds of tourists and theater goers and restaurant goers on the streets. I stayed most often at the NY Hilton on 42nd St. and 8th Ave., so I was in the center of all the Midtown madness a lot -- by myself. Your HGI is 2 half-blocks away from that (now permanently closed) Hilton, so I don\\'t think you need to worry about a crime situation in that neighborhood. And the crowds are returning, according to the NY Post:\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/04/12/times-square-crowds-show-nyc-returning-to-life Here is a recent video from times square to give you an idea about how many people are around at night. The hotel you mentioned is actually down the block going towards the public library and bryant park. Basically moving the opposite direction from where a lot of the problems have been reported which is over by port authority.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW6FdBfAPmM\\nEdited: 5:18 pm, May 13, 2021 I don\\'t know if we\\'ve lost the OP but while it\\'s true the hotel is closer to Bryant Park, the nearby dining is likely in Hells kitchen. I will repeat, since theater is still closed, I see no reason to stay in that area. I would say any area is safer than the west 40’s. For those in the know, is there a definitive list of kosher restaurants in NYC and where they\\'re located in relation to the various areas? I\\'m itinerary planning now and trying to slot in meals. For one of those days we will be at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum - is there anywhere kosher in that area; at the World Trade Center? Bravo Kosher Deli on Trinity Place is the first that comes to mind if you’re looking for a place for lunch. Google is your friend. Bravo Pizza is near there, but there are others as well (At least Before Covid) There are SO many different lists. I posted one on your other thread. There are many restaurants all over the city. You need to specify if you’re looking for pizza places and inexpensive spots or the more expensive places. There are a number of high end steak places (also mentioned on hour other thread). So budget is important.\\nAlso, can you provide info on what locations, and lunch or dinner?\\nThis may help. https://yeahthatskosher.com/tag/kosher-nyc/ Also, in FiDi, there are 2 steakhouses, Bravo, and Nish Nush. thanks for all your help - I\\'ve only just started working on the itinerary so at the moment I don\\'t have specific areas apart from the one mentioned above as that\\'s our first day; definitely not looking for high end restaurants but just decent food to eat at either lunchtime or early dinner. If you don’t mind the question: would you be interested in vegan restaurants that use no animal products but don’t have hashgacha or do you only want places w a t’udah. Risa: just curious where Bravos Steakhouse is? I\\'m familiar with Harry\\'s and Delmonico\\'s, but I don\\'t think Delmonico\\'s has reopened yet. Thanks It’s a sequential list. There are two steakhouses, which I didn’t name. Then a comma, then listed two additional places.\\nThe two steakhouses (which I had named in OP’s other thread) are Reserve Cut, and Wall Street Grill. Both are in the financial district. Both are kosher. And both expensive. I’ve been to Reserve Cut a few times but not Wall Street Grill. I understand that it’s very good, though. I don’t eat steak, the sushi at Reserve Cut didn’t overwhelm me.\\nDelmonico’s and Harry’s are not kosher.\\nEdited: 2:31 pm, May 11, 2021 Get Kosher GPS, its an App that tells you where the nearest kosher restaurant from your location My outbound flight is from LGA, however, my inbound flight is to JFK. Are there any parking garages with shuttles to both airports? Both of my flights are early am. Ideally, I would like to park in a location that is between both airports. park at JFK as the Long term Parking there is cheaper and take a Taxi from JFK to LGA Howard’s idea is probably the easiest. If you have time and are packing light, you could also take the Airtrain/subway to Jackson Heights the Q70 bus to LGA when you leave. Your car will be accessible via the Airtrain when you return. Visiting NYC for the first time with a family of 5 in June. Seems like Midtown is recommended? We are not super touristy people - we want to see NYC but probably prefer a more low key neighborhood with cool restaurants. I\\'m trying to book a hotel and have no clue what to expect. we loved staying in Greenwich Village - much different vibe than Midtown and fits what you\\'re describing. Union Square / Chelsea / Soho / Tribeca are other areas you may enjoy. The areas mentioned by Haleakala Crater would fit what you describe you want really well. I think you might enjoy those more than Midtown, from what you write in your post.\\nAnother area to consider is Upper West Side, residential with good communication links. Depending on the interests of your children (and ages), this location puts you close to American Museum of Natural History if that appeals to some of them. Also, walkable to Central Park.\\nEdited: 10:00 am, May 13, 2021 Budget and room needs are a big factor\\nTo get hotel advice specify 1) travel dates (Hotel prices vary significantly by date/demand) 2) room/bed configuration needed and any amenities desired 3) arrival airport and 4) hotel budget. There are not that many options for a family of 5 if you plan to stay in 1 room. And you can\\'t squeeze 5 into a room for 4 for fire and safety reasons. While I agree with the advice you\\'ve been given, I honestly can\\'t think of any options for 5 in the areas in post #1. (Most are in midtown).\\nThe Residence Inn financial District is one idea. Their suites are a decent size, have kitchens and the room rate includes breakfast. There are lovely parks in the area and you’re near several ferries and plenty of dining options. Sohotel has rooms with 2 queens and a single.\\nhttps://www.thesohotel.com/deluxe-family Thought actionkid did a nice job with this video. He went by one of my old buildings and then was like half a block from my other building. Gives a good idea of what life in NYC is currently like to give real perspective. I don\\'t think he really knows what is inside Citypoint as he only mentioned Katz\\'s and some of the stores. There is a whole wide range of dining options downstairs mostly food stands with food from all over the world. It is a bit on the pricey side, but good quality stuff. I never noticed that the historic districts use brown street signs.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUS2ZuZ7go Thank you for sharing!\\nFor months now, my husband and I spend our after dinner hours watching live NYC walking tour feeds from various persons and this guy is one of the best. I find these live walking tour streams help me plan future trips and it’s fun see the places I’ve already been.. Funny, my husband has only been to NYC once with my daughter and I about 5 years ago and years ago as a teen and he hated everything about it. Yet, he is the one in control of the tv remote and chooses these to watch. He says he can see all of NYC while sitting on the sofa. He says big cities scare him. These streams excite me and make me wish I were there at that moment. Counting down...returning again on Sunday, leaving my husband at home ;) Always follow ActionKid and a few others to get my NYC fix and ideas of places to visit.\\nTomdnyc is one I like to follow too as his walks are really informative and funny.\\nI watched a live walk over the weekend around the East Village - very vibrant and busy not the doom and gloom perspective being portrayed by some. Nice to see people enjoying the outdoor dining and parks , I really hope this continues next year when we visit in the summer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dqc3CKUrlk\\nTitled NYC is not dead tomdnyc is fantastic! Always guaranteed far more than just entertaining walks...engaging history lessons as well. I rarely watch anything on television, but could watch these for hours. Thanks for sharing his Alphabet City link! Hello all, I have been to the magical new York six times now but not for two years. A few questions if I may, so we think new York will be On the green list soon? Is Woodbury common all open and are Macy\\'s and century 21 open at the moment? Many thanks in advance Most retail has been open for a long time. NY state capacity limits and other restrictions are being reduced https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/home\\nIt is unclear when the Federal govt will permit non-essential / leisure travel from the UK https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html\\n(What is the green list?)\\nC21 went bankrupt - some are supposed to reopen but specifics are unclear https://www.fox5ny.com/news/century-21-department-stores-to-reopen-in-nyc-internationally Thank you kaye wow c21 bankrupt? My understanding of the UK green list is that it\\'s a list of countries you can go to and be exempt from quarantine when you return.\\nSo while of course you\\'d need to go before returning is an issue the green list has nothing to to the the US or New York (if I\\'m correct about what the green list is). That\\'s exactly what it is hank General feeling is the us will be On green very soon. Thanks for coming back to me As Kaye mentioned, even if the US is on the green list soon in the UK, it is unknown when travelers who have recently been in the UK will be permitted to enter the US. So keep an eye on those official rules as well. The US will also need to remove the presidential proclamation that currently prohibits entry to the US. As mentioned you will need to keep on eye on the US rules as well as UK.\\nFor example, Australia is on the UK green list but no way do you have permission to fly there from the Australian government. Your green list only applies to arrivals in the UK.\\nEdited: 9:34 am, May 13, 2021 Will do. Thank you I\\'m sure many already know this, but I thought I\\'d pass this along for those who don\\'t. I always book hotel rooms with the option to cancel without penalty. I usually book a few months out, rarely ever the week before. I find that when checking back at a later date, the rate I initially booked at changes, and it often changes for the better...a reduction in price.\\nI have stayed at the Cambria Suites in Chelsea each December for years now and book months in advance. When checking back and finding a cheaper rate, I book a new reservation and then cancel the old.\\nI just did this yesterday with my Artezen Hotel booking, saving $49.\\nAnd I decided to check a hotel reservation I have in California for January 2022 and ended up booking a new reservation at a $349 savings. I always book in advance with the same option to cancel without penalty but have not been that lucky in the past. However, I find that the cancellation date without fee is closer to the arrival date than it used to be. In the past that date was 2 weeks before my arrival, now it\\'s 2 days or less. I will definitely check back.\\nThanks for the tip. I do that too. Several times, I\\'ve found cheaper rates, cancelled and booked cheaper. Not always, but at least sometimes.\\nMy general take is this: When I decide to book, I look at total prices for flights and hotel. But I book separartly. Since I rarely can afford the full flex flight tickets that can be cancelled without some sort of fee, I need to make sure I can afford the total price when locking into the flight tickets. But booking them individually makes it easier to cut costs if prices happen to go down on the hotels. In pre-pandemic times, I knew when it was easier finding realtively cheap flight tickets - we\\'ll see if there is a pattern for this once I can resume travelling. I am checking around for a return trip the weekend before Thanksgiving. Hotel rates are very reasonable but airfares more than I’m used to paying. I have credit with United from my cancelled May of 2020 trip but may save it for later.\\nAlso I may be moving to a much smaller market before then. I was kind of surprised but there are direct flights to NYC from there cheaper than from my hometown. Scott - Apparently airlines are experimenting with new service for some smaller markets https://www.npr.org/2021/05/07/994087250/banking-on-busy-summer-travel-season-airlines-add-more-flights-and-new-routes Interesting read Kaye.\\nI guess kind of an announcement to my TA friends, I just got an offer and retired, my last day on the payroll is this Friday! I plan to move somewhere that I can indulge my passion for mountainbiking and the leading candidate right now is Northwest Arkansas centering around Bentonville. Yes that Bentonville which is essentially the Walmart company town. Over the last five years two of the Walton grandsons have pumped many millions of dollars into building trails and promoting the region as a mtb tourist spot and it’s working. I have been there twice and it’s got kind of a college town vibe with the influx of younger visitors and people moving there.\\nI know Walmart has some warts to their business reputation but I think the younger folks are gradually changing that. The Arts are supported here too, Alice Walton built the world class Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and an old cheese factory has now been converted to a venue for travelling installations.\\nThe regional airport XNA has international status although not sure if any flights yet, but yes AA has multiple daily non-stops to and from New York. #5 Scott - congratulations\\nThat is an unappreciated but beautiful area\\nHave you ever been to Blanchard Springs Caverns? https://www.recreation.gov/ticket/facility/233266\\nOr Eureka Springs? https://www.eurekasprings.org/\\nAnd Branson, of course, but I have to be in a very specific mood Congratulations Scott! Looking forward to seeing you the next time you\\'re in NYC. What a great new stage of life, glad you are getting to follow some dreams! That\\'s awesome, Scott. Congrats. I\\'m also into Mtn biking (and road and CX) so thanks for mentioning that area of Arkansas. I know nothing about it but will have look into it. I have a few trips booked in the near future and airfare was dramatically less than what I\\'m used to for similar flights/destinations. Not as inexpensive as last year, but last year they were practically giving it away.\\nCar rental prices are higher than normal though. I usually check rates and they have not changed for some time. Hi\\nIt’s a dream of mine to go to New York with my husband.\\nObviously I appreciate that with covid we don’t know how long it will be before we can travel safely.\\nHowever we have no idea on what a sensible amount of time is needed in New York? We have seen 4 day trips... but just can’t see how it possible to enjoy the city in such a short period of time!\\nWe are going to be travelling from either London or Manchester.\\nI appreciate it’s a vague question, but any advice would be great! The longer the better. And particularly when traveling overseas. It\\'s a pretty long flight. I\\'d say 4 days is bare minimum, but doable. I would like around a week, at least. I think the shortest I\\'ve done is 5 or 6 full days in town - got around to do quite a bit but I still say the more the better.\\nMy last two trips have been a bit longer - about two weeks. No problems filling them up with things to do and see. I loved having somewhat relaxed visits, but then again having been several times before added as well I guess?\\nEdited: 1:17 pm, February 19, 2021 This question is a bit like asking how long is a piece of string. There\\'s enough to do to stay in NYC for literally months & not repeat what you\\'ve seen.\\nNow for my practical advice. Invest in a hard copy guidebook. Look through it to see what *your* ideal trip would be. Then make a draft itinerary & post it here. We can help you tweak it to make it practical & this exercise will give you a good idea of what you want to do in the time you have available. BTW, several years ago, I planned a 1st trip to Philadelphia, found looking at my own must sees & dos & having the experts on the Philly forum tweak my trip made me realize that I needed to extend my trip by a day & I have never regretted it. Everyone is different, some come here and spend 3 or 4 days, cramming in as much as they can. Some come here and spend a week and go about it a bit more leisurely.\\nFor me, I would not travel so far for 4 days. It depends on your travel style and what you want to accomplish. Do you have a list of attractions in mind? You can create a rough itinerary and then determine the time needed to accomplish it. A guidebook might be of help as well.\\nIn my opinion, for a first time traveller, I\\'d recommend a minimum of 7 nights. Even then, you\\'ll barely scratch the surface, but can take in enough to feel rewarded.\\nI fully agree with the last comment that post #2 mentioned, forums are great for advice, but you need to develop your own must see & dos. We went to school and have lived in The Village for 50+ years and still enjoy every day that we are in the City and out-and-about.....of course these days given the weather, the pandemic and our ages (70+) we are not outside too often. That said, anytime spent in NYC is always worth the trip.\\nCH If you are coming from abroad, I would give myself 7 days, 6 nights so you can visit some boroughs and take your time each day to see the multiple museums, get great food, and get a vibe of what it is like in one of the best cities in the world. For people coming from overseas I would say at least a week. If someone was domestic I would say they should have at least 4 full days, unless they only live a few hours away which allows them to easily return. People can come for months and not see everything, so it is not reasonable to expect to see everything or most things. Four full days not counting arrival/departure days is sufficient to give people a brief overview of the city and visit some of the more popular attractions. An easy way to think about it is how much time would you recommend for someone coming from the US to London stay? Having lived in both cities they are similar in terms of time required for attractions etc. Its not that different than any large city like London, Paris, etc. 4 days minimum, 5-7 days is a good amount. Personally I wouldnt do more than 7 on a first visit I think it depends on budget, how much time you can take off and personal travel style. Some people prefer short trips while others like longer more leisurely trips. If you\\'re museum people, try for at least 5 days. If you can afford it, I think 7 days is about right for a first timer. You can fit in all of the main sights in 7 days and it might give you inspiration for a second and more visits. I would recommended at least 5 nights. Hi, due to stay 6 nights in NY in October and have initially booked into The Royalton Park Avenue because we automatically assumed we need to be bang in the middle of it all.. We will obvs be doing the usual sightseeing etc but during the evenings because we are with our 10YO daughter, we realised that we will prefer to be in a much more relaxed and laid back (low-rise?) safe area so we can wander around and find casual restaurants/cafes etc rather than stuck in the hustle and bustle the whole time.\\nI would appreciate any recommendations for the right areas we should consider? Are we on the right track looking at Greenwich Village perhaps?\\nAny recommendation appreciated. TIA I think the Royalton Park Ave. is in a great location. It\\'s not smack dab in the middle of everything and there are plenty of good neighborhood eating places. (there\\'s another Royalton hotel closer to Times Square and I\\'m wondering if you have them confused?). The hotel has a chic boutique-y vibe and a roof deck that pre pandemic used to get a lot of business. I don\\'t know what things will be like in Oct. But frankly, if you\\'ve got a room with a sleeping setup you like at a price you like at the Royalton PARK AVE, , I wouldn\\'t switch. Greenwich Village is a nice area but there aren\\'t many hotels there. The Standard East Village comes closest to the Royalton.\\nMany people recommend the upper west side as a good place for families but the hotels there are limited.\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nis most popular, an apartment style hotel, but I think where you are is more interesting. The area of the RPA is called Nomad and just below it is the flatiron district. Thanks for the reply - that is great to hear re location. sounds like we have best of both worlds where we are booked!! TBH I have an incredible rate at RPA (that is the correct hotel BTW) through an acquaintance so was reluctant to give that up and pay double elsewhere. Thanks for the feedback. Yes the RPA isn\\'t located in the middle of times square or anything. It is in a safe area and isn\\'t overwhelmed with crowds like closer to times square is in normal times. Upland is a 5 min. Walk from the hotel, very popular with burgers, salads, pizza etc. good for sharing. Nice atmosphere.\\nhttps://uplandnyc.com/\\nMadison Square Park is not far and where the original Shake Shack is located.\\nL’Express is a French bistro 10 min. Walk from hotel that used to be open 24/7.(maybe still) Very good basic food for any time of day.\\nhttps://lexpressnyc.com/ That hotel is close to a favorite restaurant- The Little Beet Table - casual and great food.\\nAnd close to 230 5th - if you get a nice/warm day, your daughter might enjoy a rooftop experience with a great view of the Empire State Building? If you try, I\\'d recommend afternoon or early evening. I agree about location of Royalton PA and Little Beet Table. Also Broadway between 27-29 has many great places to eat. Many casual. Many with outdoor seating. Hello,\\nI\\'m planning to visit NYC- Manhattan at the end of September for about a week (Solo Traveller).\\nI plan on staying closer to Times Square or Central Park...\\nSomewhere close to the center of Manhattan so I could get to most of the places by foot (I don\\'t mind walking).\\nI\\'m going to visit there alone so I hoped to take any ideas/advice from travellers or locals especially locations and attractions that are recommended to visit and even some of the unconventional stuff that I shouldn\\'t miss.\\nAlso, I would really appreciate to consult you about the itinerary and the recommended hotels for solo travellers on budget.\\nSince it\\'s going to be my first time there, I wanted to receive information about the following:\\n-Things to do (That are not shopping/window shopping)\\n-Places to visit\\n-Recommended hotels for solo travellers\\n-Things I should bring with me\\n-The weather during this time\\nThanks in advance! I am planning on visiting the same time so I am gonna tag along for info! :) Bring an umbrella. Weather is typically nice at their end of September.\\nHotel is usually dictated by budget.\\nFor things to do, check out a guidebook and see what interests you. Hello Ray G\\nI am planning a solo trip myself in September.\\nThings to bring with You - Lots of money 💰 😉, 2 pairs comfortable shoes, a good map for starters.\\nA variety of clothes depending on your style .Clothes for layering to suit different types of weather that you may encounter. I agree it will probably be very nice weather and it maybe even hot temperatures.\\nLearning how to take public transportation is essential in my opinion . Even though you may think you can walk everywhere, but Most likely will be something that will be too far to walk.\\nOr you may just be too fatigued to walk at sone point.\\nWhat do you want to do depends on you. What are your interests?\\nWhere you choose to stay also depends on your interests and style I believe. Naturally how much you are willing or can spend on a hotel has to taken into account.\\nIf you would like to stay near Central Park you should search hotels there and get an idea which ones are affordable to you. Dates of travel matter hotel prices fluctuate.\\nI think for the travel experts to help you here , you should be a little more specific about how much you can spend on a hotel, your interests and Reasons you are coming to New York. You must have some idea of some things that you want to see or do. In order to give you good hotel recommendations, we need to know your exact dates of travel as hotel rates vary daily, budget in US $ (btw, it\\'s helpful to us if you edit your profile to include a home base as then we can tailor our recommendations more precisely) and if you have any preference as to bed size or if you can do a shared bathroom.\\nAs for what to do & see, there is so much of that & people vary so widely that it is impossible to give you a one size fits all itinerary. I agree that you need to get a good guidebook either by purchasing one or getting one out of your local libary. If you do that & have any specific questions or can give us a little more idea of what you like to do (like what sort of unconventional stuff you like) we can better help you.\\nEdited: 2:03 pm, April 28, 2021 LaRue400 posted what I was going ta say about public transport. NYC is a great city to visit as a solo traveller, and also great for walking. But typical tourist sights are spread out. From the southern edges of Central Park to Battery Park (where the ferries to Statue of Liberty departs) it is almost 5 miles. So being familiar with public transport so you can use it to speed things up sometimes, or just rest your feet a little bit in between lots and lots of walking is a good idea. Or perhaps take a cab (but personally, I prefer the convenience of subways). Just saying!\\nBeing near Times Squre or near Central Park will put you close to some things, and further away from other things. Perfectly ok areas to stay in, but there are others that are just as good options too.\\nFor things to do, look at the thread \"What are the Must sees and Must Do\\'s\" in the left hand column (if your on a laptop - dont think you can see those links on a phone). Perhaps use a guide book too. What are your interests? A few suggestions of things that I like can be found below. I\\'ve been several times solo and I typically shop very little or nothing at all.\\n* Take an architect cruise with Classic Harbor Line\\n* Walk Brooklyn Heights Promenade and then Brooklyn Bridge back to Manhattan\\n* Explore Financial District, which has lots of historically interesting things to see.\\n* Visit Staute of Liberty - book tickets in advance\\n* Visit museums. There are many! Depending on your interests, some might fit you better than others. I tend to look for museums that either focus on my specific interests or those that have some interesting exhibits that catches my eye (permanent or temporary). Some of my favorites are: Met Museum (has pretty much something for anyone), American Museum of Natural History, Whitney Museum, Queens Museum, Museum of Moving Images (the permanent Jim Henson exhibit is terrific), New York Historical Society, The Cloisters (very interesting area too), Guggenheim ... and I know I\\'ve forgotten some.\\n* Since you like walking, walk past some interesting buildings. So many to choose from.\\n* Visit one of the observatories. My favorite is Top of the Rock but there are several others too (Empire State Building, One World Observatory and the new ones that I forgot ...)\\n* Spend time in Greenwich Village and East Village. Two great areas, well worth walking around in. Lots of restaurants too. You can see the FAQs on a phone but you have to scroll to the far right of the screen & maximize the typeface so it\\'s a bit of a bother. Ah, I see. Thanks, I wasn\\'t sure if you could see those or not on the phone. I use a laptop since I don\\'t have a smartphone. #5 Good post Maxisweden. Your ideas of what to do are good ones. They might fit a large number and variety of visitors .\\nBTW Roy G , Maxi Give me the recommendation of the hotel that I ultimately chose based on my budget ,interests and travel style - the standard east village. (TY again maxisweden)\\nMaxi & others could do the same for you, if you post Your budget, interests and traveling style.\\nEdited: 2:30 pm, April 28, 2021 LaRue - so glad you liked the look of The Standard East Village and that you booked it! The area - East Village - is great. Hotel prices tend to fluctuate by date. Typically, Sept. is a pricey time.\\nThere really aren\\'t hotels designed for solo travelers although some hostels have single rooms which are quite small. The Westside YMCA is one of the best located hostels and while I don,t agree with your thinking on being “Central” it happens to be near Central Park. There are both rooms with private ensuite bathrooms and some with shared bathrooms and some in dorm rooms where you share both room and bathroom. If you\\'re looking for a place where you might meet some other solo travelers, Hostelling International is popular and runs tours. The Pod hotels also ahbpbe some small single rooms, some with shared bathrooms and some with ensuite. Citadines has opened a hotel in NYC and prices are good.\\nThere are loads of people on this forum who regularly visit solo. NYC is a great place to be solo. You can do whatever you want and no one will blink an eye. Taking some tours might be a way to meet others. Given the pandemic, I\\'m not sure which tour companies will be operating.\\nFreetoursbyfoot.com\\nhas been popular and has both guided and self guided options on their website. I\\'m taking my 10-year old son to NYC for a few days and he has asked if we will go to an art museum. I\\'m not an art person although I\\'m all for encouraging it in him. The choices are mind-boggling--does anyone have a recommendation for that ONE amazing place you\\'d take an extremely precocious 10 year old? He loves history and engineering. No question about it - the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They have an encyclopedic collection, TONS of history along with the art.\\nYou and he will have a blast!\\nEdited: 3:18 pm, May 05, 2021 The met and its not close\\nHe should like the swords , the armor , the mummies and stuff like that Agree with Linda and Howard -- the Metropolitan Museum of Art is definitely the one! :) Right, the Met for sure.\\nIf we can infer he\\'s also into architecture then maybe the Guggenheim. Personally I think it\\'s just ugly and on top of that a horrible design for viewing art but what to I know. A lot of people think it\\'s a great building. The art if good but I\\'d take the Met in that regard any day. The Met is the largest art museum in the US. Its holdings are vast, which may be a problem. You can easily get \"museum feet\" with little effort. The Egyptian wing is probably the most popular attraction there. It is supposed to be the largest outside of Egypt. To avoid crowds at the main entrance, use the ground level 81st St. entrance that can be used by anyone.\\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit\\nEdited: 5:31 pm, May 05, 2021 I would also suggest the Whitney Museum of American Art for a precocious 10 year old, if he might like modern art. Take a look at the current exhibitions on their website and see if they would be suitable.\\nhttps://whitney.org/\\nWith that one you can combine it with the High Line and Chelsea Market, if those appeal.\\nOtherwise, The Met is great. Lots of different things as well as art. The Met is great and easy to combine with Central Park. But it is huge and somewhat overwhelming. Another option is the Brooklyn Museum which is also very eclectic and architecturally interesting but more manageable. That could easily be combined with the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens and/or Prospect Park. The Brooklyn Museum is a great idea, too. While the Met is a world museum, and an incredible one, the Brooklyn Museum is not just more manageable - it really focuses on being accessible to the community (lots of explanatory texts in galleries, etc.).\\nIf your son is interested in American history and social movements, the Brooklyn Museum is IMO better than the Met - its American galleries are organized in a way that really presents the whole problematic sweep of U.S. history.\\nEuropean art & history, on the other hand, is the Brooklyn Museum’s weak spot. If that’s his interest, then the Met is a better choice. (Both have strong Egyptian and African collections.) The Brooklyn Museum has Mummies too. I mean what 10 year old wouldnt want to see a Mummy You might want to put your son in charge of figuring out which museum(s) he would like to go to. There are so many here -- plus the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Immigration Museum (these are on one ticket via www.statuecruises.com) and even the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock.\\nCompletely agree that the Metropolitan is fabulous, and the most comprehensive. Also agree that a trip out to Brooklyn to the museum there, perhaps plus the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, would be a fantastic outing. Prospect Park Brooklyn is just a couple of blocks away, and contains the Brooklyn Zoo.\\nFor history, he might be interested in the New York Historical Society: https://www.nyhistory.org/\\nThe American Museum of Natural History has dinos, meteorites, a planetarium, and all manner of things historical in the natural world. https://www.amnh.org/ It\\'s usually a sure bet with kids, but I think it will be even more enjoyable than ever with timed tickets. It sure can get crowded!\\nYou don\\'t say when you\\'re coming but he might enjoy a Circle Line cruise around Manhattan to have a look at all of the sky scrapers from the water. It\\'s unforgettable. Just a note -- these are different from the boats that take you to Liberty Island and Ellis -- that one is Statue Cruises.\\nHere\\'s an article about STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) museums in NYC:\\nhttps://www.tripsavvy.com/stem-attractions-in-nyc-4097932 They have some cheap rates at the Pod 51, possibly at the others depending on your dates. Rates seem to be starting from around $80.00 p/n at Pod 51 for a few dates I\\'ve looked at.\\nRate is cancellable, pay later, with a 24 hour cancellation window.\\nUse promo code DREAM to look at the rates. Compare the various rooms too because some have a shared bath.\\nPod 39, Pod 51, Pod Times Square, Pod Brooklyn.\\nhttps://www.thepodhotel.com/ I lived in the NYC area all my life but my knowledge of accommodations is limited. I now live in South America. I\\'ll be visiting shortly and will be meeting up with 2 friends for a few days. We\\'ll need a place to stay for 3 nights, separate beds. Can someone recommend an affordable (~$200/night) place in Manhattan? Tall order, I know, I\\'ve been looking. We\\'re not too keen about staying in one of the boroughs or Jersey, but will consider something close to transportation and not in the middle of nowhere. Like Hoboken or LIC. Thanks. The Moxy hotels (3 locations in Manhattan) offer quad bunk bed rooms https://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-rooms/nycox-moxy-nyc-times-square/\\nAlso the Freehand https://freehandhotels.com/new-york/rooms/\\nPrices vary by date so you\\'ll have to see if it\\'s within budget As Kaye has stated, we need exact dates of travel in order to give you the best recommendation. In my extensive search for a hotel and by reading this forum, Iam aware that The Wolcott Hotel has a room with 3 single beds. Thanks for the responses. I\\'m happy to find options. The Moxy and Freehand look good. The Wolcott came back with no availability. [June 4-7] $200/night for a room with 3 beds in June is a tall order unless you want to stay in a hostel. The Westside Ymca is in a great location. You could get 3 single rooms there within budget but with shared bathrooms.\\nhttps://ymcanyc.org/guest-rooms Sohotel (thesohotel.com) has a standard family room (a single and two queens) for $239 + tax and $20/day fee on Expedia. Above budget I know, but one that sleeps three in separate beds. My sisters and I had reservations in March 2020 that we never got to use 😩 so I don’t have first-hand experience there, but we were excited by the looks of it. We’re looking forward to getting out of the city for a day in October, and hear that the train to New Haven is a pretty trip, and trains are frequent enough to make a stop or two for lunch/dinner and sightseeing. Suggestions? I can\\'t speak for the New Haven line, but if you\\'re open for alternatives, a trip on the Hudson line to Cold Springs can be a lot of fun. Take Amtrak to Mystic, Only a few trains go there so you have to be more selective and then take a taxi from the station to Mystic Seaport Thanks! We’re going to Hyde Park first and looking forward to that train ride into the city. We might consider doing the Mystic trip with no stops but spend a longer time in Mystic. The Hudson line is one of the most scenic train rides in the country\\nFor Hew Haven there\\'s the Yale campus and a few other interesting things https://www.visitnewhaven.com/ Not sure which other stops have much within walking distance, except maybe Stamford which is nice enough but IMO not particularly scenic\\nFor either, if on a weekday, I\\'d initially go to the farthest planned destination and work your way back (off-peak fares) Go to New Haven. The Yale campus is there. Peabody Museum and the Yale Museum of Art. Also they have great pizza in New Haven and Louis Lunch, the place where the first hamburger was made. The train ride from NY to new haven is not very scenic. Mostly towns and some ugly cities like Bridgeport. The train ride between new haven and mystic can be very scenic as the trains go through the wetlands and small towns. forgetting about the train ride, Mystic is worth your time anyway. It seems you are looking to see the East coast, Its quintessential New England Coastal City and Mystic Seaport is a world class place to visit The train ride to Mystic on Amtrack will cost you twice as much as well as public transportation when you get there that’s not as reliable.\\nMetro-North has trains with fewer stops ‘express’ to New Haven and once you get there Yale, museums, the best ‘APIZZA’ and a melting-pot of ethnic restaurants, shopping at IKEA or take a cruise of the Thimble Islands in Branford, or maybe a brew pub. New Haven Yellow Cab, Uber and Lyft are all readily available.\\nhttps://thimbleislandcruise.com/about-us/\\nEdited: 9:48 pm, May 11, 2021 I dont know OP\\'s situation , but if Money isnt an Issue, Mystic is much nicer than New Haven (I dont think new Haven is that nice) , Just know when the trains are so you can catch them properly. Mystic might be the nicest City in CT (ALong with Litchfield) Hi,\\nI’m planning a two week trip for later this year from the UK (recently found out that I can get most of it with free cancellation).\\nI have two weeks in total and plan to fly into NYC for Xmas and new year, probably a total of around 11 days and then spend the remaining 3 days in Boston.\\nI would like to see Washington DC and Philadelphia and have seen on the map that it it looks possible to do a day trip to each area from NYC?\\nI’ve not been to NYC before and enjoy doing all the usual tourist attractions when I travel. I also like visiting music related locations. Do you think 9 days in NYC, a day for Washington DC and Philadelphia each, and then 3 days in Boston is a reasonable plan?\\nIm unsure whether to shorten the time in Boston to fit in more in NYC? I’m only interested in seeing the main Boston highlights but was thinking of going for a few days and flying back from there because of the journey time from NYC.\\nAny advice welcome thanks! Philadelphia is an easily doable day trip from NYC by train\\nDC is much farther away and, while not impossible, much less practical for a satisfying day trip\\nI\\'d recommend you consider rearranging the order of you visit\\nConsider flying into Boston (or DC) traveling between all 4 cities by Amtrak and then flying home from the city on the other end https://www.amtrak.com/routes/northeast-regional-train.html\\nHow much time to spend in each place depends on what you want to do.\\nNYC hotel prices for NYE are the highest of the year. Unless it\\'s important to be here for the festivities you may want to spend that time elsewhere 2 quick thoughts for now:\\n>> NYC to DC goes through Philadelphia - so I\\'d look to combine them vs. thinking of them as two separate day trips (BTW - NYC to DC would be one VERY long day trip).\\n>> Better - If you could work it to fly into DC and out of Boston, your travel would be way more efficient (Amtrak will take you from DC to Philly to NYC to Boston in nearly a straight line...) P.S. It sounds as if you are in the early stages of planning.\\nI\\'d recommend you do some research on your \"must sees\" in each city to help determine how much time to allot to each city. The individual city forums can help you tweak a proposed itinerary for efficiency\\nIMO DC is worth more than a day. The historical core of Philly will require less time. 3 days for Boston is probably about right\\nThere are three DC airports https://washington.org/DC-guide-to/washington-dc-airports + 1 for Kaye\\'s suggestion of doing research on what you want to do. I know, based on MY interests and travel style that those four cities would require more time than two weeks - but may very well be doable for you and your interests. I would say DC is the second most interesting city in the US to visit (After NY).\\nFly into Wash DC, Spend 3 Days there, Go to Philly and Spend 2 Days there, Spend 7 Days in NY and 2 Days in Boston and then fly out of Boston\\nWeather can be lousy in Winter in Boston\\nEdited: 10:16 am, May 10, 2021 It sounds like you should research on DC and re-think. Someone who says \"enjoy doing all the usual tourist attractions when I travel\" and especially if museums are considered usual tourist attractions will need/want a lot more than a day there.\\nEdited: 11:11 am, May 10, 2021 Here are some of the things I am interested in seeing so far, in Philadelphia there isn’t much which is why I’m thinking of only a short stop.

I spent a long Mrmorial Day weekend in Philly & spent most of my time looking at the historical sites and museums. I did see the Rocky Statue but only because it is outside of the main fine arts museum. When I have gone to DC for the day, often to go to show at museum, I have flown, usually on the Delta shuttle Saturday special. Both Xmas and N Years Day are Saturdays this yr, though I expect there may be good fares midweek week between the two holidays, like Tues., Weds, because people aren\\'t working, congress will be in recess, and holiday traffic will be pretty much limited to the holidays and days immediately joining them. The best rates appear to be over the summer months. Rooms start at $125.00 p/n.\\nFor anyone travelling soon, try promo code INTRO to see how the rates stack up for you, and be aware there is a facility fee as well as the usual taxes so look at the final total.\\nIt\\'s a pay later rate, credit card needed to hold the reservation, with a 24 hour prior to arrival cancellation option.\\nIt\\'s not a bad location, handy to Hudson Yards, the northern end of the High Line, walkable up to Hell\\'s Kitchen for eating, walk to midtown and Times Square.\\nhttps://www.arlohotels.com/special-offers/midtown-opening/ Which NYC hotel would it be?\\nI\\'m missing New York (I may or may not have cried on the way to work recently just thinking about how magical New York is at Christmas...)\\nWe\\'re looking at booking a purely speculative trip in May, in the full knowledge that it may not go ahead. We\\'re seeing really good prices in Manhattan that will make a lot of hotels that would never normally be anywhere near our budget, attainable.\\nThe two hotels that we\\'ve stayed at the most have been the McCarran in Brooklyn (love the pool, balcony, the neighbourhood, the proximity to the water) and the Empire in Manhattan (proximity to Central Park and plenty of subway lines). We\\'ve also stayed at the New Yorker, Wall Street Inn, the W financial district, the Pennsylvania (shudder).\\nI\\'ve always had a hotel crush on the High Line Hotel and the Beekman, the buildings are just so beautiful.\\nWhat are your faves?\\nWhere would you stay if money was no object and Covid disappeared? The Greenwich hotel - for the look of the rooms and the location\\nMandarin Oriental - a room with a view of Central Park\\nQuite unlikely on my budget tho\\' ;) But I can always dream, can I not? Absolutely!\\nMy question and speculative trip planning are born of day dreaming of the US for the past few weeks incessantly.\\nAfter a health scare this week, I\\'ve decided to book it and see what happens! It can always be pushed back...and back again...and again if needs be, but it gives us something to look forward to :D The McCarren Hotel is in a good location in Williamsburg, but just across the street is the William Vale and that would be my preference over the McCarren. Great hotel, stunning views, great location. I\\'d happily stay at the William Vale again. McCarren is likely to be cheaper, so budget does play a role in deciding hotels.\\nIn Manhattan, there are a couple that I\\'d love to stay at. I love a view, so the Ludlow Hotel on the LES is one. It\\'s also modern yet eclectic.\\nAnd one of my favourites has been the New York Edition. Fantastic and very pretty location at Madison Square Park. We like the Washington Square Hotel just across the street from Washington Square Park in the heart of Greenwich Village and stay there when family comes to visit NYC and we give them our Village apartment. The area is vibrant with universities and attractions, close to SoHo and Chinatown for shopping, has great outdoor dining (for these COVID days), and easily accessible public transportation.\\nNote: The Washington Square Hotel does not always list all of it\\'s room availabilities on the Internet. We have found that directly contacting the Hotel yields best results. For more information, see:\\nhttps://washingtonsquarehotel.com/\\nCH There are so many nice ones - some of which are perpetual favourites.\\nBut right now, The Equinox would be my choice. It\\'s the closest product I know to the Aman group.\\nhttps://equinox-hotels.com/nyc/ If you want the views, A high floor at the Plaza overlooking Central Park , if you want a view of Times Square the Marriot Marquis Personally I\\'d love to go back to the Royalton Park Ave. Absolutely huge bath tubs, nice rooftop pool, and walkable to some really nice breakfast options. I always said I wanted to wake up on my 50th birthday in the Plaza Hotel with a Central Park view. That didn\\'t happen, so now I have the same goal for my 60th! -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

I stayed three times in the Solita Soho on Grand St. Small but efficient rooms, reasonable rates, and great location. Assuming it survived the pandemic, there’s a diner for breakfast right across the street, lots of eating and shopping nearby, and multiple subway options within easy walking distance.\\nI stayed once at the Wyndham Garden Chinatown, just outside of Soho. More expensive but a bit nicer with walls of glass in the rooms, rooftop bar, and a restaurant/bar attached. Same attributes as above.\\nWould stay at either of these again. Thank you Scott S.!! Hotel Hugo, Arlo SoHo. Hi,\\nTravelling to New York in April 2022, 6 nights, 2 adults and 10yr old- can anyone recommend a clean and quiet hotel? Better to be in the centre or travel in? Clean and quiet... We like the Beacon on the Upper West Side. Two blocks from the Subway and easy access to all things NYC. The neighborhood is great with many places for eating, drinking, and shopping. You are two long blocks from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History is 10 minutes walking...\\nAnd you do not want to be in the center. In order for us to give you the best recommendation, we need your exact dates of travel (hotel rates vary daily,) budget in US$ including 15% tax & bedding configuration. 8th-14th April, up to $280 a night There is no city center here, attractions are spread out. Key is to be near the subway. There are many neighborhoods to choose from and your budget should allow for some good choices. Quarentine for tourists is still in force?\\nWhen will it be lifted? Asymptomatic travelers entering New York from another country, U.S. state, or territory are no longer required to test or quarantine as of April 10, 2021. Quarantine, consistent with the CDC recommendations, is still recommended for all travelers who are not fully vaccinated or have not recovered from laboratory confirmed COVID-19 during the previous 3 months. Symptomatic travelers must immediately self-isolate and contact the local health department or their healthcare providers to determine if they should seek COVID-19 testing.\\nAll travelers must complete the Traveler Health Form unless the traveler had left New York for less than 24 hours or is coming to New York from a contiguous state. Contiguous states to New York are Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont.\\nhttps://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory\\nIf you are an international traveler different Federal rules about travel may apply to you https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html and your airline may require negative test results We have no idea of when any Covid restrictions will be lifted. ***We have no idea of when any Covid restrictions will be lifted.***\\nThey\\'ve been lifted, read the info that Kaye posted, that is from the travel advisory.\\nThe city is open, come spend your money and have a good time. Rules are different for international and domestic visitors. Where are you coming from? Yeah, i’m from Peru Given that Peru is experiencing a large amount of covid cases including variants from Brazil and a new variant that may be either from peru or Chile it would not surprise me if the US changes the rules in the near future when it comes to admissions from other countries in the region. They already have restrictions on travel from brazil, so it is something to be aware of. I am from Costa Rica going to NYC next week (may 15-20), I heard you only need to present a valid ID (Passport in my case), in order to receive a J&J vaccine on the walk up locations... can you confirm this?\\nI understand that Tourists are welcome and Cuomo is just waiting to receive state approval to vaccinate on the Tourist attractions...\\nAppreciate your responses as in my country the process is still pretty slow for my age group (47 years young) Read this whole thread and included links https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13544321-Domestic_tourists_can_now_be_vaccinated_in_NYS-New_York_City_New_York.html Thank you , it seems that by just presenting the valid ID (passport), I am eligible for the vaccine... no proof of residency or immigrations status is needed.\\nGuess I just wanted reinforcement of someone there in NY, besides the info on the website. Other states are more explicit about non US residents and vaccination. Saludos! The current announcement is for domestic travelers only, folks who live in the US. How they are checking that I do not know Search here by location and brand https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/ That is the thing: what are they asking besides the valid ID / Passport?... it looks like no residence or immigrations status is needed anymore, which I would understand, given the announcement made by Cuomo last week... if this is true, I guess that I should have no problem getting the vaccine... There has been no feedback from visitors that I am aware of.\\nFor the reasons mentioned in the linked thread NYC is probably your best choice to try. When I went a few weeks ago I showed my ID and health insurance card (but health insurance is not required)\\nI think they will ask the address of where you will be staying\\nRead the eligibility section of here https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/frequently-asked-questions-0 Regular posters of this forum know that I’m somewhat obsessed with this phenomenon which is the intersection of nature and human urban nurture.\\nIt’s when the sunset aligns with the urban grid in Manhattan so that it is directly visible through the east-west streets.

Hi All,\\nI am planning on flying out of JFK with a 10:40am flight to Cancun in Terminal 8 of JFK airport.\\nI have access to the Amex Centurion Lounge in Terminal 4; I\\'ve heard great things about the lounge and would love to check it out before I fly out.\\nI was thinking about getting to the airport around 8:00 to allow for ~45min of time in the lounge before heading back to Terminal 8 through the shuttle service.\\nDoes anyone know if this is doable? Usually I would feel okay about this but I\\'ve seen that you need to go through security twice at JFK and I\\'m not sure if flying internationally complicates things.\\nI will have no checked bags and am a U.S. citizen. Thank you! What shuttle service?\\nI doubt if you will be permitted to enter a terminal you are not ticketed for I was referring to the AirTrain!\\nI am confident that you are able to enter one terminal with the flight being in another - I have done this multiple times at other airports. The only hiccup is that JFK does not have post-security connections, so one would have to exit the first terminal and go back through security You would actually choose to arrive 90+ minutes early and take an unnecessary extra trip through TSA security to see an airport lounge?\\nTo each his own I guess...\\nYes, feasible.\\nAdvisable???????

Hidden gems are a matter of what your personal interests are. The amount of time you will be here can also be a factor since some interesting neighborhoods and historical sites are in the outer boroughs\\nTransit is still on modified schedules (although that will change soon) and masks are required regardless of vaccination status https://new.mta.info/coronavirus For hidden gems, I would suggest a look at Untapped New York (https://untappedcities.com/) The Main NYC public library and Performing Arts branch of the NY Public Library, recommended by blumebwaybaby in #1, are excellent, but unfortunately are not currently open to the general public.\\nYou can check the library\\'s website to find which locations are open when you visit.\\nhttps://www.nypl.org/ Hi all!\\nI am planning a trip to NYC this summer and started to hear a lot of things about crime rates that went up recently and that the city is far from being what it\\'s been before the virus.\\nWould you change destination?\\nWould love to hear your thoughts about this.. I guess this info will be helpful for many more folks.\\nThanks! Following this thread. I\\'m planning the same trip, so I need this info, too **Is it safe to visit New York in summer 2021?**\\nAbsolutely!\\n**Would you change destination?**\\nAbsolutely not! Safe from crime? Yes. Just use some basic street smarts (aka don\\'t wave your wallet around or go down any dark alleys...).\\nSafe from the pandemic? I think early summer will still be too soon for most leisure travel. I happy live here and feel perfectly safe. No one knows what the Covid status of the city will be. Be prepared to comply w laws and rules about quarantining, if applicable, or don’t come. As far as crime goes, it’s not any more of a consideration than in any other locale. Maybe far less than other big cities.\\nFor local color, read the Experiences w Re-opened Restaurants thread.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13342331-Experiences_with_Reopened_Restaurants-New_York_City_New_York.html\\nEdited: 9:51 am, January 14, 2021 Your other thread would have been a good place to ask this question. Keeping all your info together helps folks to help you Crime rate isn\\'t a major issue. Impact of covid is a much bigger concern, Things will not be back to normal by summer. How much is open by the summer is anybody\\'s guess, so I would not plan an expensive vacation unless its fully refundable until you know that what you wish to see will be open and available.\\nEdited: 10:42 am, January 14, 2021 You\\'re asking a question that will yield varying opinions.\\nAny big city is going to have its share of crime, that\\'s just a fact of life. When visiting any city, be aware of your surroundings, watch your behaviors, etc.\\nMy first suggestion is to look at official crime stats, take a look:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/citywide-crime-stats.page\\nAlso, here is the official NYPD News Twitter page. It showcases police work, but also has information related to crimes, etc.\\nhttps://twitter.com/NYPDnews\\nMy opinion, NYC is safe.\\nStatistics and news stories sometimes sensationalize stories. Crime does occur, but again, keep your smarts, be aware, etc.\\nHomelessness has increased in past years and there have been incidents with those that are suffering from mental illness, etc. Not that it helps, but most major cities have those problems. Crime in many US cities has gone up with the Covid crisis. Partly, this might be due to people wearing masks and being less easy to identify. There is a feeling that gangs are using this time to carry out attacks on rivals. The main concern I would have ,as stated by others, is what state the city will be in as far as reopenings. Some places have gone out of business and will not be back. Theaters will likely be the last things to return to normal. The reluctance of some to take the vaccine may prolong the outbreak. I suspect things may take longer than than expected and would get only refundable tickets. To the extent that random street crime is more of a worry before, it\\'s largely because bars and restaurants currently have a 10pm curfew due to Covid. A few months ago, their curfew was midnight. Basically, about an hour or so after the bars and restaurants close, many of the streets get fairly deserted in a way that they never normally would be.\\nSo, it really all boils down to how we are doing with regards to vaccine distribution. Meaning, we\\'ll see if the incoming administration is able to come up with a better plan than the outgoing one.\\nthink that things will be mostly back to normal by at least late summer, but large events like Broadway and sporting events might still be closed until the fall.\\nEdited: 12:50 pm, January 14, 2021 You need to keep your wits about you and be aware of what is going on all around you. Where I live there have been some random criminal acts in the middle of the afternoon, not just when the bars close. I realize some of these have been committed by mentally ill homeless who deserve our sympathy not our scorn, but mentally ill status can be cold comfort when one of them approaches you from behind on 3d Av in the 40s in the middle of the afternoon and slams a brick into to the back of your head, fracturing your skull. Or picks up a heavy metal trash can and heaves it at you. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nThis post has been removed at the author\\'s request.

Public hospitals in Manhattan that do testing include Bellevue, Metropolitan, Harlem. I have no idea what type of testing they do, how quickly they give results or in what form.

It had that huge ballroom for the dancing throngs. Does the Roosevelt even have a ballroom, much less one the size of the Waldorf\\'s? Yes it does. I got married there. And I had just under 300 people at my wedding, and didn’t use the balcony for seating. And had a huge dance floor.\\nMy ceremony was in the room where the press conference in Maid in Manhattan took place. Then moved to the ballroom.\\nEdited: 1:09 pm, October 12, 2020 Many of the hotels built for the railroad business from Grand Central may be demolished for offices, etc. with the rezoning of the area. 1 Vanderbilt Ave. at 42nd St. is the first of these.\\nhttps://www.onevanderbilt.com/#main Really surprised a hotel like this which is iconic wouldn\\'t be able to survive compared to some others. From 1929 to 1959 Guy broadcast his New Year\\'s Eve show from the Roosevelt Grill. Then he switched to the Waldorf. #2 - Certainly not me. I had a moment of who the ____ is Guy Lombardo? Had to look him up. Way before my time. My taste in holiday music more runs to the Pogues and A Fairy Tale of New York. If you asked me to recommend a top end hotel, Roosevelt would never even cross my mind. So doesn\\'t surprise me. This thread makes me wonder how many posters are Gen X and younger versus pre-baby boomers. I\\'ll be in New York City in July, but I won\\'t have much time. Maybe 3 or 4 full days, I\\'m still figuring out the train schedule. This is my first trip to NYC, and clearly 4 days isn\\'t nearly enough to see everything, nor do I expect to, so what I need help is with prioritizing so I can see enough to have fun. This surely won\\'t be my only trip to NYC in my life, so everything I skip can wait.\\nFor background, I am a graduate student studying urban planning, particularly rail transportation, in California, and I have decided to ride Amtrak around the country country because that\\'s long been a dream, and right now I have the time and money, and I\\'m fully vaccinated. That\\'s the reason for such a short stay in New York City. I\\'m taking Amtrak Los Angeles - Seattle - Chicago - Boston - New York City - New Orleans - Chicago - Emeryville - San Jose (my home), and while I don\\'t need to spend much time in Los Angeles or Seattle because I visit those cities all the time, I do want to spend 3-4 days each in Chicago, Boston, NYC, and New Orleans, and that plus multiday trains all really adds up. I haven\\'t booked a hotel, but I\\'ll likely book around Penn Station.\\nSo in terms of prioritizing, I can say right now that I\\'ll want to visit the Intrepid, because there\\'s a space shuttle on it and one dream I have is to see all the remaining space shuttles. Plus I love both museum ships and air and space museums, so it\\'s an attractive option regardless. Furthermore I definitely want to ride the subway. I hear the Bronx Zoo is world-class, so I probably want to go there. How does the Central Park Zoo compare? Beyond that, I\\'m looking for museums, particularly train museums, science museums, aviation/space museums, and history museums. I\\'m a huge museum nerd, those alone can satisfy me. I don\\'t think I need to visit the Statue of Liberty, but is there a different excuse to ride the ferry? I do like riding ferries, almost as much as riding trains. You could take the Staten Island Ferry for distant views of Statue of Liberty and great views of Lower Manhattan. Takes about an hour. Or if you want to spend about three hours, you could take an architecture cruise by Classic Harbor Line. They are narrated by architects and very interesting - would possibly suit your urban planning interest? It passes by Statue of Liberty for phot ops.\\nThe Bronx zoo is much bigger. Ultimately, this will depend on how much time you want / can spend on visiting a zoo during a short visit. This one will take more time, both when it comes to visiting and the travel back and forth to the zoo. Central Park Zoo is smaller, but won\\'t take as much time to visit.\\nThe New York Transit museums sounds like it is something for you.\\nThe Met Museum has a lot of history to offer (The Egyptian wing / The Temple of Dendur if that appeals to you) for example. I really like the arms & armory part of the museum, since I\\'m interested in those things.\\nEdited: 2:41 pm, May 09, 2021 Also, if it were me I think I would cut a little time in Boston. It\\'s an interesting city but smaller than New York City. Perhaps two days there so you could add one more day in New York city? For NYC have at least four full days. You don\\'t need four full days in Chicago and you can probably get away with three days for Boston. I haven\\'t been to New Orleans so I\\'m not sure how much time it requires. The central park zoo is more like a kids zoo. It is in no way comparable to the Bronx zoo. As you mentioned the Intrepid is pretty much essential viewing for someone of your interests. There is the museum of natural history if you are interested in that type of history. I also suggest you read up on the MET. While it is an art museum there is a lot of historical exhibits. There is the NY transit museum in Brooklyn but I don\\'t know if it has reopened yet. You could pair a visit to that museum with a walk over the brooklyn bridge or a visit to the promenade for some views of the skyline. +1 for the New York Transit Museum. I would skip the Bronx Museum as it is the size of the city & easily takes two or three days to go through. The Staten Island ferry is free and goes not too far from the Statue of Liberty.\\nI would consider changing one of your cities to Washington DC so that you can visit the National Air & Space Museum. I might also suggest you past this query to the Road Trips forum so that they can review your entire trip. I\\'ll keep in mind that maybe I could cut Boston or New Orleans to 2 days. I\\'m not sure about Chicago. I eeally want to go to the Illinois Railway Museum, but that\\'s in Union, not Chicago, and while there is a way to get there without a car, it takes a long time, and I\\'m basically devoting an entire day to that (I can\\'t drive, so no car rentals for me). So Chicago should need at least 3 days, accounting for one being taken up going to that museum. But yea, 5 days in NCY may be doable.\\nThe Bronx Zoo may well be worth the time, especially if I combine the Bronx Zoo and the ferry into one day, which sounds doable. I really like a good zoo, to thr point where I\\'ve travelled all the way to San Diego just to go to the zoo before. Sounds like I\\'ll be skipping the Central Park Zoo.\\nThe MET may be of interest. I went to the Antiquities Galleries in the Louvre and greatly enjoyed it, so what\\'s described does sound interesting. The Museum of natural history is probably something I\\'d really like.\\nI will definitely want to see New York\\'s transit museum.\\nEdited: 3:00 pm, May 09, 2021 The reason Washington DC isn\\'t on this trip is I\\'ve been to Washington DC and the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum (including the annex in Virginia where the space shuttle Discovery is) before, so I\\'d rather take Amtrak\\'s Crescent train from NYC to New Orleans. Also, can/should I get the Excelsior Pass if I was vaccinated in California, to make things more convenient? Yes my comments about Chicago were based upon the city itself. If you have specific plans to travel to areas outside of chicago that is going to add significant time. I\\'m not sure which ferry you mean. If you mean the staten island ferry it would be difficult to combine that with the Bronx, since the staten island ferry leaves from the southern tip of Manhattan and the bronx is north of Manhattan. Not saying it can\\'t be done but I wouldn\\'t pair those two items together in the same day. No the pass as of now only works for people who were vaccinated in NY. It isn\\'t able to check California vaccination records. You should continue to follow developments though because they may add some other states in the future if those states wish to join. Bring your vaccination card to be safe.\\nEdited: 3:16 pm, May 09, 2021 Well, one thing to note is that because I\\'m a graduate student studying public transit, I have an extreme level of tolerance for long public transit rides, to the extent where I may plan a day trip as much to make an excuse to ride a transit line as to actually go visit the place in question. For me, \"experience riding the NYC subway all across Manhattan\" in between the Bronx Zoo in the day and ferry in the evening isn\\'t necessarily unattractive. Observing a new public transit system and reporting on my opinions to others in my program is itself a worthwhile activity. That\\'s the train nerd life.\\nActually on that note, that\\'s the reason Boston is on this trip. I really want to ride the Acela. I have just read that The Roosevelt will be permanently closing at the end of this month. I stayed there on my first trip to New York. Absolutely loved the hotel and the position. So sad 😞 The rezoning of Midtown East may have something to do with this. This change was to clear the way for large modern office buildings that may or may not be the things of the future. The Roosevelt suffered from the usual old hotel problem of room sizes below modern expectations. The lobby with its high coffered ceiling was always a pleasure to see and the location was a convenient one. The Grand Hyatt on 42nd St. may be another to go. Claire and Fox: Your posts about the Roosevelt and the neighborhood are very helpful.\\nThe Roosevelt joins 9 other hotels that have or will permanently close since COVID-19 arrived in Manhattan in March. Those 9 other hotels are:\\n1. Marriott East Side\\n2. Maxwell\\n3. Omni Berkshire\\n4. W NY Downtown\\n5. Hilton Times Square\\n6. Excelsior\\n7. Courtyard Herald Square\\n8.

I think those areas are more active right now.\\nEdited: 11:14 pm, May 10, 2021 Hello, My wife and I will be in New York for 8 days in November. Wondering where to stay. Midtown or Soho? We don\\'t mind walking. Would like to see some normal tourist spots as well as neighborhoods. Most recommend staying in Midtown for first timers. Which we are. But, also like what Soho has to offer as well. Not sure. Safety is also important. Suggestions? I prefer Soho, since it\\'s in my opinion a bit more interesting area. Lots of restaurant options too. But ultimately it\\'ll come down to which hotels you\\'re looking at - you can easily travel between the two areas. Midtown is a big area too so the hotel choice could sway me either way.\\nBear in mind too, that I\\'m one of the posters here who typically tend to favor and recommend the downtown areas over Midtown when it comes to hotel locations. Mostly based on my own travel preferences, of course.\\nEdited: 9:46 am, May 09, 2021 Midtown covers a lot of area, is there a specific hotel in midtown that you\\'re entertaining?\\nEither way, I\\'d recommend Soho any day long vs. midtown. Soho. Hands down.\\nWhen you walk out of your hotel, you will have charm, street life, many cute coffee places to choose from, and more possibility of local shopping (although plenty of chain stores too). Not even a question. Thank you so much!! Very helpful Thank you so much! Appreciate it!! Depends on what you want to do. If you are going after thanksgiving and want to look at all the Christmas decorations and you plan to focus heavily on museums , the park and shows then midtown would be more convenient. If your time is going to be more spread out across Manhattan including dedicating substantial time to southern manhattan etc or you prefer to stay in an area that is a bit more residential at night or you are into nightlife then Soho can make more sense. With eight days I would go with Soho, because you have extra time to travel between locations unless you are the type of travelers that like to return to your hotel room throughout the day. If you were only coming for like 3 or 4 days then I\\'d lean more towards midtown, because it provides quicker access to various points in the city. Just note that midtown can be a bit frenetic. Midtown hasn\\'t been frenetic in over a year. There are more people out now, but I don\\'t think that even by November it will be as packed as it was pre-pandemic. A lot of what made midtown so frenetic was all the office people rushing around. I think there will continue to be a lot of telecommuting with only occasional office meetings in the near future, so it shouldn\\'t be the sheer shoulder to shoulder insanity that it used to be. Maybe next spring it will be more like that. Most first timers do prefer Midtown but with 8 days SoHo will be calmer and nicer. Midtown can get wearing after a while.\\nOr you could split the stay with 4 days in each area? That would be a good way to experience both. And choose your \"favourite\" area / hotel as the last 4 days so you end the visit on a high.\\n(Also note that there are areas east and north of Midtown that are better than right in Midtown near Times Square. They are not as busy as close to Times Square so they\\'re not as crowded and are still handy to the Midtown sights.) Thank you for your response. We will be there the first week of November. Red259 We typically will be gone all day and love to walk. 8-10 miles a day easy. Love to explore as much as we can handle in a day. I think we will try to see things in all parts of Manhattan. I will be in NYC in mid-May, Tuesday night through Saturday morning, traveling with my adult daughter. She\\'s been to NYC before; I have not. We\\'re flying into JFK. I need to visit a showroom for work in Chelsea, but otherwise we are hoping to be as touristy as is possible during a pandemic.\\nMy questions: Where should we stay in order to be close to things that are open? And is there a website you might recommend to get a good idea of what we might be able to see at this time? I assume mass transit is the best way to get around...?\\nNot having been there, I really don\\'t have a sense of distance, the time it will take to get from point A to B, etc.\\nThanks for any guidance! Things that would help people help you -\\nWhat is your budget all-In for hotel\\nAre you comfortable using public transportation\\nMore specific ideas of your interests Thanks for helping me start down this planning path.\\nI think we should be fine navigating public transportation. Have been able to get around Chicago, etc., without incident.\\nRegarding a hotel, I tend to be a Priceline / Hotwire user, and was seeing what seemed to be very good prices for chains that were recognizable to me (e.g. Staybridge Suites near Times Square for $91/night w/a hot breakfast buffet; Fairfield in Downtown Manhattan for $87 w/hot breakfast, etc.). Those rates are in a fine range... but I have no clue if those areas are optimal in relation to places we might want to visit.\\nAnd finally, regarding things we\\'d like to see / do, I think Ellis Island, a sightseeing cruise, the WTC site, and Central Park will be on our lists. I wasn\\'t sure if we\\'ll likely find most everything open but with Covid precautions, or if almost everything will be closed and and we\\'ll only be able to walk around Central Park. We live in central US states that haven\\'t seen the hard shutdown that much of the US has. We just hear, \"Everything in NY is shut down!\" and don\\'t really have a sense of what that actually means.\\nThanks for your help! Would not recommend Times Square as area of hotel choice. Many other better options in Manhattan. Just stay near a subway stop and you can get anywhere. I also would not factor free breakfast in my decision making. Breakfast spots are limitless and range from food carts to fancy restaurants depending on budget.\\nEdited: 2:25 am, April 30, 2021 There are two Fairfield Inns in the downtown area. One is called Fairifield Inn Downtown / Financial District (on Front Street) and one is Fairfield Inn Downtown / World Trade Center (on Greenwich Street). I couldn\\'t from your post figure out which one you\\'re looking at?\\nI\\'m one of the posters here who often do recommend people to stay in the Financial District. It\\'s been my experience that it can be possible to find decent prices on some hotels there fairly often. At least for travel dates I\\'ve looked at.\\nPersonally, I prefer the location of the World Trade Center Fairifield one on Greenwhich street. Whenever I\\'ve stayed in the Financial District (once at that specific Financial Inn) I prefer a location more in the \"center\" of the area and I tend to avoid the hotels that I think are too far west in the area. This is MY preference because if I stay in the area I want to be close to the subway hubs in the area and take advantage of being near several subway lines.\\nThe Fairfield inn World trade Center location is nearer to more subway lines than the Financial District one (altough only by a few minutes walk so the point is perhaps moot - but for me very important). Lots of good prices now in NYC, I wouldn\\'t book thru a third party like Priceline There is not one central tourist area. Attractions are spread out all over the place. Instead of looking for a website, I recommend getting ahold of a guidebook. If you use a website, you will tend to look at only the things you think you want to see rather than seeing everything that is available to see. I agree Hotwire and PriceIine are not a good idea IMO right now. There are good prices without them (although maybe not that cheap) and you won,t get a room with 2 beds. I also wouldn\\'t want a buffet breakfast right now, but you may not agree. Are you both vaccinated?\\nThe Hampton Inn Chelsea is in a good location, less touristy area, near decent food and happens to include breakfast.\\nIf you start using google maps, you will see distances, time to travel and get actual directions.\\nMaps.google.com\\nType the trip from point a to b there (ie JFK airport to Hampton Inn Chelsea, nyc) click the train icon at the\\ntop and you get subway directions. The default setting (car) is driving/taxi. The person icon shows you a walking route and each gives estimated time to travel. Sometimes walking is best.\\nIf you want to actually go to the Statue and Ellis Island, you should book ASAP\\nStatuecruises.com\\nIf you just want to pass by, there are loads of different cruise options. The Classic Harbor Cruise has smaller boats and feels a bit more special. They do some cruises with drinks or music but not sure those have started.\\nhttps://sail-nyc.com/public-events/\\nMost things are open but may have restricted occupancy which is why booking in advance is helpful. WTC site and Ellis Island are both open, and of course Central Park and I’ve been getting emails from Classic\\nHarbor about their sightseeing cruises.\\nhttps://sail-nyc.com/\\nMany of the museums have reopened at partial capacity and you need to reserve in advance. It’s not true that “everything is closed.”\\nIf you can post any general ideas about what you would like to do maybe someone can let you know what is available. The biggest changes are the amount of retail that has closed, and the amount of eating that is now taking place outdoors. I was wandering around Soho today and pre-pandemic it was always packed on weekend afternoons (I mean crazy packed on the sidewalks) and today it was mildly bustling with lines at some of the stores due to limited capacity inside. Most of the outdoor dining spots were also packed, some with lines of people waiting for tables. Last Saturday night the restaurants in the West Village were also crazy busy. South of Canal Street it’s comfortably busy but not as crazy. Depends on the area. We’re finally getting some posts with trip reports again (yay!) so you may get some ideas and a sense of what’s open/busy etc. from them. Things will be changing quite a bit as the weather warms up and some of the restrictions are loosened so it will be hard to keep up. Check that the hot breakfast buffet is still offered in COVID times if it is important to you. We often stay at Residence Inns, which also have free hot breakfast buffets, but those are are no longer available; there are cold grab n go bags instead.\\nEdited: 2:52 pm, May 02, 2021 We sometimes get asked about Friends locations or whether Central Perk is open etc, but now there is an immersive Friends exhibition that has been open since March.\\nLocated in the Flatiron District at 130 East 23rd Street.\\nThere are two floors of exhibits of 18 rooms, including the orange couch in front of the fountain, Monica’s kitchen, the hilarious \\'Pivot!\\' scene, and the Las Vegas wedding chapel where Ross & Rachel tied the knot.\\nThere will even be an actual functioning Central Perk that serves coffee, pastries, and desserts, which will be open to the public daily starting at 7am.\\nTickets are on sale through September and the price is pretty hefty, but if you\\'re a fan it could be worth it.\\nIt reminds me of the Seinfeld exhibition with Jerry\\'s apartment that was on a few years ago.\\nMore info and how to buy tickets: https://www.friendstheexperience.com/new-york The Apartment building is real, Its in the village\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CKKSpGRrzbS/ And here I thought this was going to have something to do with the historic Friends meeting house, or maybe the Friends Seminary, down on Stuyvesant Square. i would have loved this, but chances are it will be closed by the time i can visit It\\'s on until September according to the ticket page. I went with my sister last month. It\\'s a giant photo op with exact replicas of the sets, along with displays of some of the costumes and props from the show. You get a card with a QR code that you register to your email address, and it gets scanned at all the official photo stations - they email you an online album at the end. You can take as many photos as you want with your phone, and staff will also take pictures for you.\\nI think they are only selling tickets a couple of months in advance due to the ever-changing COVID-related rules. We had a great time. There is also one in Chicago right now. A new trip report of Colonial Area houses in Queens\\nThe first stop was the Queens Farm Museum in Glen Oaks, Yes this really is a farm in NYC, The house is from 1772 and if there isn\\'t a special event here, its free to go. They have some nice animals here to see. There is even a barn here (Its used for Special events, I once went o a wedding there) . They had special events here (Before Covid) like Sheep Shearing , Indian Pow-Wows Hayrides and more. All in Queens\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/COi0qiMt8A0/\\nThe next stop is the Kingsland Homestead in Flushing, It dates from 1772. Its home to the Queens Historical Society\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/COTq5F1LT_3/\\nI wasn\\'t there on this trip, but right behind the Kingsland Homestead is the Bowne House which dates from 1661 (I posted this before). Its one of the 5 oldest buildings in NYC\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CLkdk9zLwjB/\\nAlso I was not here on this trip is the Quaker Friends Meeting house and cemetery, It dates from 1694. The cemetery behind the Meeting house is pretty cool seeing really old tombstones\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CLopSznLCew/\\nThe final stop was the Vander ended Onderdonk House in Ridgewood. It dates from 1661 or 1706 depending how you count. This house is really strange in where is located, its a total industrial Zone. You are in an industrial zone and all of a sudden this colonial area house appears\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/COYtqgHLRTy/ Another historic site in Flushing is just a bit east of the Quaker Meeting House. It is the place where the \"inhabitants of Vlishing\" signed a protest, now known as the Flushing Remonstrance in 1657 that declared religious freedom for \"Jews, Turks, and Egyptians\" and all. Nearby is the Flushing High School\\'s second building, the first free public high school (1875) in what is now NYC. Flushing was a very progressive village at the time with a very early public library as well. Thanks very much to both you gentlemen for interesting and informative NYC history.\\nLots of similarities to each of these early Dutch colonial houses and cemeteries to ones on Staten Island, back when it was all New Amsterdam, before the British made it New York.\\nAnd there\\'s a Friends\\' House in Manhattan that\\'s still in use if I\\'m not mistaken (or just living in the past.)\\nEdited: 4:44 pm, May 07, 2021 When you say Friends, I thought you meant this\\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CKKSpGRrzbS/\\nBTW if anyone was curious how I found these places, It was from the website Untapped NY. They mention all these places with the addresses or it was easy to googe them once you had the name of the place Good stuff, thank you both for all the great information.\\nI\\'ve been to the Queens Farm Museum and it\\'s a great visit. I\\'ve been to one of the sheep shearing events, it was very interesting. When my daughter was smaller, I used to go there all the time, Its not that far away and if there arent any events going on its free and you can see some animals, Animals and kids are always a winner That Bowne House picture in the snow is gorgeous. One could easily visit Downtown flushing, Flushing Town Hall, The Friends Meetinghouse, the cemetary behind it. The Bowne House and Kingsland as a 1/2 day trip and then go to Flushing Meadow Park and Citifield.\\nI am not a foodie, but the food choices in Flushing will satisfy anyone and its cheap Thanks so much for this wonderful info! The Pandemic has allowed me some time to visit places in the city I had not been before and I have found some really good gems (Like Van Cortland Park). Most tourists are not going to these places, but there are plenty of people who come to NYC on a regular basis and looking for new places to visit.\\nHopefully this series gives them some idea\\nI still have to visit Wave Hill in the Bronx, Hamilton Grange (Alexander Hamiltons house) and 6 old houses in Brooklyn (5 of them are pretty close to each other in the Marine Park Area of Brooklyn) . Hopefully this weekend I can visit something Howard, thanks for a fabulous post. I would like to see the list for the 6 old houses in Brooklyn. Keep going! Great stuff. This year NYC saw a 30% jump in murders and 30% rise in rapes. Also, many violent assaults are happening in broad daylight. These facts should not be ignored. Democrat Cuomo\\'s no cash bail reform and early release of prisoners was a sognificant reason behind this major spike in crime. I figured it would be very helpful information for potential tourists to start a thread listing the terrible crimes that are happening in main tourist areas. My suggestion to tourists is to find a safer and cleaner place to travel in the US. What are the sources of your statistics? 30% increase compared to when? \"What are the sources of your statistics? 30% increase compared to when?\" He is comparing just one month March 2021 to March 2020. You know March 2020 when the pandemic started and during that month when the city went into shutdown and now he wants to point out how crime is higher in March 2021 compared to March 2020 when the city was closed down and people were dying en masse during the pandemic. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff has removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guidelines with regards to off-topic chat.

Why should people have to worry that they might be attacked from behind by some criminal or mentally ill homeless person? The police are hopeless and the incompetent mayor does nothing about the crisis of crime. Thanks Houdi. Here is a link comparing crime rates. Murder and rape went up 30% in the last year even during a pandemic when hardly anyone was out. There was a violent assault and robbery that recently happened at 1st Ave Subway station. I have never seen crime occuring this often in regular tourist areas in my lifetime.\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/news/p0406d/nypd-citywide-crime-statistics-march-2021 \" Here is a link comparing crime rates. Murder and rape went up 30% in the last year even during a pandemic when hardly anyone was out.\"\\nAgain that link is comparing the month of March 2021 to the month of March 2020, so no it doesn\\'t say what you claim it does. Not really sure what you insist on misrepresenting the statistics. Year to date rape is up 0.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, but down over 25% over the past two years. Robberies are down 18.3% in 2021 over 2020.Muder is up 9% over 2020. There is a huge difference between today\\'s violent crime and that of the bad old days of the \\'80s and \\'90s. Back then there was a certain amount of predictability- you knew what neighborhoods to avoid and at what times. But these days the violent beat downs are happening everywhere, in broad daylight, to all kinds of people - not only Asians- young and old.\\nI think that it is a great disservice to potential tourists to make believe everything is fine in NYC when it isn\\'t.\\nHere\\'s hoping the next mayor will get a grip and do something substantial to save New York -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff has removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guidelines with regards to off-topic chat.

It\\'s a good price for 2 x return and hotel, trouble is I need to fly onto Dallas for an additional 3 nights and then back to UK whilst my wife returns on the flight from New York. My question is would she face any issues at the airport on return if I am not with her? The price to book all flights separately is astronomical comred to booking the package them my 2 flights to Dallas an Dallas back to UK. You need to ask Virgin. Every offer has its own rules. Anyone answering here would be just guessing. Not sure what issues you are thinking of, but I can\\'t imagine any.\\nIf you want to make it easy and comfortable, get a car service (but budget enough time for traffic). One possible issue is if tone person will be able to baard the plane, when one person in the booking is a no show? And that is a question for Virgin to answer, depending on booking policies. Ahh... Is that what you meant?\\nMy GUESS is that your wife would have no issues, but you might have an unpleasant surprise on your nexy credit card bill for visiting fare rules...\\nAs Risa noted, ask the airline...\\nEdited: 12:22 pm, May 09, 2021 Thanks for replying, was just wondering in case none has done this before and what the outcome was. Are you working with a travel agent who helps you with this, or are you looking yourself?\\nSimply asking since Virgin does have a multi-city option on their website.\\nEdited: 1:06 pm, May 09, 2021 Best place to ask is the airline, since that will be the only reliable source. You can try posting in the air travel forum to see if anyone had that situation in the past. What is the best form of transportation from LGA to Times Square in May 2021? Best is subjective\\nYellow cabs are available (on the meter so costs vary by time/distance)\\nThere is a public transit option (bus to subway) that costs a total of $2.75/person (which line and destination stop varies by specific hotel location)\\nDue to covid I don\\'t think any of the shuttles are running\\nhttps://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/public-transportation best= cheap or conveniient or fancy? Depends on your defniition of reasonable.\\nTaxi or bus/subway are the options Last time I traveled to NY was Oct 2019. At that time, when I flew into LGA, due to construction, there were shuttles taking you to taxis. Is that no longer the case? Can you get a taxi right at the terminal? It really depends, do you want to take public transportation or not? If you do, then go that route. If not, a taxi is the easiest way to go, hop in and enjoy the ride, nothing to think about, etc. I have used Carmel car service in the past. Current rate is $36 from LaGuardia to Manhattan, plus toll and tip. They are very reliable. Others on this forum have recommended Dial 7. Using a car service avoids the stress of traffic congestion running up the meter, as well as handling luggage on the bus/train transfer.\\nhttps://www.carmellimo.com/General/Rates.shtml If you use a car service for an LGA pick up you must now meet them at the Car Service pick-up area for your terminal\\nhttps://www.laguardiaairport.com/to-from-airport/car-service-and-shared-rides Has anyone used onairparking at JFK airport? Very cheap, makes me weary. Said is at hotel onsite and take air tran to terminal. Any feedback?

Hello,\\nWhat would you recommend better out of the 2 hotels for a 3-4 night stay in terms of location, cleanliness, & comfort?\\nThanks! Teen and myself are staying in NY for a week in early June. Which hotel should we choose? We are walkers and plan to also take the subway to visit the sights. What are the pros and cons to each area?\\nAny help is appreciated?\\nClaudia Both have convenient access to transit etc. With broadway closed though I would recommend the east village location. More interesting area to walk around.\\nEdited: 2:38 am, May 07, 2021 I would also recommend the East Village location, even when Broadway reopens. More interesting area in general to hang out in and walk around in. Easy walk to Washington Square Park too which is lovely when the weather is nice. You can easily take the subway and get to Times Square to see the lights one evening which is of course tourist-iconic. East Village is a great area for dining too.\\nDepending on how old the teen is and what the teen is interested in, might sway you one way or another too. East Village is close to some of the New York University areas so it may appeal to an older teen perhaps even more because of its vibe (which may have changed temporarily if universities have been closed or been more on a remote learning scale still). But in general, pre-pandemic times this has had a wonderful vibrant vibe. I just stayed at the Moxy EV with my spouse and our teen. Loved it!!! The area has lots of good restaurants within walking distance and it’s also an easy walk to the Village. The EV also has a small, neighborhoody feel as opposed to staying in somewhere like Midtown. The configuration of the rooms is also creatively designed to maximize the small space and the rooms have huge windows (ours had a great view of city and the Williamsburg Bridge). Many folks think that Times Square is the center of everything. However, that can mean it is noisy, crowded & frenectic. East Village, hands down. Thank you guys! I move my reservation from TS to EV just now. Abt 140 in total more but I think it will be totally worth it, I already found several restaurant to visit in the area!\\nRibalta\\nEast Village Pizza\\nCacio i Pepe\\nVia della Pace\\nNotice a theme? Kid is mad about Italian food. Cannot wait to visit.\\nThanks again!!\\nClaudia Excellent, smart choice.\\nRibalta is good.\\nTwo other suggestions for Neapolitan pizza:, Motorino and Luzzo\\'s. Both are walkable from your hotel, Luzzo\\'s is one of my favorites. Thanks Springerandy! Adding those to our list!! Also we added one day. We are staying a whole week! So exciting!!\\nClaudia You are welcome. Enjoy your trip and yeah, an extra day is always good. Another vote for the East Village.\\nDo you and your family like to eat BBQ meat? You might like Mighty Quinns BBQ in the EV. It\\'s a very casual BBQ place with meats, salads etc. Pretty cheap if comparing restaurant prices.\\nAnd the Chikalicious Dessert Bar could be a favourite for everyone.\\nAnd for other EV suggestions, The Ziggy food blog (our resident foodie currently on hiatus) is a goodie, but due to the pandemic places could have closed or changed since it was written:\\nhttps://eatingwithziggy.com/2012/07/10/east-village-quick-bites-perfection-in-a-bun/\\nhttps://eatingwithziggy.com/2012/07/09/east-village-quick-bites-part-ii/ Hello all\\nI wish you are great. I ll be visiting New York for a week I am asking about the current situation during the pandemic; regarding touristic trips - sightseeing & the best outlets for shopping with reasonable price?\\nThanks When are you planning to visit?\\nThings are starting to open up more now - and the mayor is promising \"a full reopening\" in July - but not 100% sure what that will mean - as, for example, Broadway shows are not expected to return to normal until much later. Hopefully After 10 days There are loads of things to do and see in NYC right now. Yes...some things are closed/closed down, but you can easily fill a visit with memorable attractions.\\n-Grand Central\\n-Rockefeller Center\\n-Central Park\\n-Prospect Park\\n-Greenwood Cemetery\\n-Walk the Brooklyn Bridge\\n-Union Square\\n-Washington Sq Park\\n-Shopping at Macy\\'s\\n-Couple ^ with a photo op at Madison Sq Garden\\n-Prospect Park(Brooklyn)\\n-Brooklyn Flea\\n-Coney Island\\nI could go on and on. NYC is open and alive. Loads to do/see. I do not think International Tourists are allowed in the US at this time. You will have to wait to visit until the US government allows international visitots Thanks a million @ter1413 for such generous answer I asked the embassy in my country & it is allowed but may I double check again. Thanks Do you already have your visa to visit US? If you don\\'t, you may have trouble getting one in the next 10 days as I understand most US embassies and consulates around the world have suspended normal visa operations and are dealing only with exceptional cases and emergencies.\\nIf you do have a visa, you will still need to be tested for COVID 1-3 days before your departure. please, can you help me for finding outlets in New York or around with reasonable prices? No new 3-star restaurants again:\\nhttps://ny.eater.com/2021/5/6/22422661/michelin-restaurants-nyc-stars-2021 It\\'s now 2 year+ since we\\'ve been to NYC and can\\'t wait to get back and go to Don Angie again. Mouth is still watering for that Chrysanthemum Salad. Great neighbourhood restaurant. I\\'m happy to see Rezdora got one star, and that Thai Diner and Xilonen have received Bib Gourmands. They\\'ve both interested me lately.\\nBut I can\\'t see how they could have come to any sort of proper conclusion about who\\'s to keep what and who\\'s to get what based on the last year. It\\'s been a year of lockdowns, closures and re-arranging. Hmm I was thinking about going to Le Bernardin. Not sure if I should go for tasting menu or the four course. Re: Le Bernardin\\nGo for what you can afford. The tasting menu is an experience, but if you don’t want to spend that amount, a less expensive option will still be terrific. How much wine do they give you with the wine supplement on the tasting menu? It like half a glass per dish? On the other hand, it\\'s the Menu at the Bar of Le Bernadine I\\'ve been wanting to have. One day, yet! WEQ, I had the full tasting menu years ago. It was absolutely wonderful. But I\\'ve been to the bar and eaten there a number of times in the last few years. It\\'s a pleasure. I am so over long prix fixe meals with all of the fanfare, it\\'s not enjoyable to me. But the bar has the same high quality wonderful food, and it\\'s far more relaxed and enjoyable (I still dress, but the formality is relaxed). I am not into long tasting menus that starred restaurants offer. Too long and not really what I want to eat. I prefer \"my\\' comfort food and love little munchies. My daughter and I talk often of having a \"date\" there but never got to it. Just waiting for things to change and travel to be a breeze and a pleasure again. Will that ever happened before I getting doddering ancient.\\nPS I am back to dressing \"post covid\" style. Just no lipstick as it\\'s a drag to have a smudged face as well as a \"mask face\".\\nEdited: 1:08 am, May 08, 2021 We travel to NYC next week to see a friend near 245 E 80th. We would like a comfortable, clean hotel near her apartment. The Carlyle is too pricey. Other suggestions? One consideration is that my husband needs easy access to breakfast for his meds. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28953-i4-k13517956-Hotel_near_245_E_80th-New_York.html#109626631\\nI know that was from NY state so you are checking NYC sub-forum but thought it would be helpful for others to know what was mentioned already. Not a lot of choices in this primarily residential neighborhood.\\nEdited: 7:11 pm, May 07, 2021 So not too many hotels on Upper East side.\\nYour friend\\'s place sounds like it is between 2d and 3d Avs. Affinia Gardens on E 64 between 3d and Lex, offers apt style setup and there are many places to eat nearby. It has uptown buses on 3d and downtown buses on Lex and 2d. Marriott Courtyard is on E 92 just east of First Av. There are uptown buses on First Av and downtown ones on York and 2nd Avs. Also should not be difficult getting taxis to/from either of these places. There is also a subway line on 2d Av, but am not sure nearest stations would work for you. There is the 86th street subway station for the Q line which has an exit on East 83rd and second avenue so a simple three block walk. Both those hotels about 3/4 of a mile from your friend\\'s place, one to south, the other to north. My wife has the desire to go to New York City at Christmas ,she also has the desire to stay on the upper Eastside. Take a look at the Franklin on E. 87th St.\\nThe rates are much less here than other upper Eastside hotels that she’s looked at.\\nhttps://www.franklinhotel.com/ But be sure to check reviews for Franklin and book carefully. I understand rooms there can be quite small. We always read reviews carefully. Everyone should.\\nBooking .com shows the square footage of most hotels. Which is a useful tool to help decide as well. But location and budget is the most important factor IMO when choosing\\nEdited: 7:28 pm, May 07, 2021 \"But be sure to check reviews for Franklin and book carefully. I understand rooms there can be quite small.\" Seems like they did some renovations during the pandemic which are getting good reviews. I think the Franklin renovations would matter to me if I knew they made the rooms larger. I recall hearing many complaints over the years about size of rooms there.\\nNote to OP: Sorry, I made mistake on Affinia Gardens. It is between 2d and 3d, not 3d and Lex. So actually a bit more convenient for your friend, who is also between 2d and 3d. Not to dwell on The Franklin for longer than needed, but my wife informs me a king room is 185 square feet.\\nSo, if that sounds too small, then look on .

It\\'s closer to areas with good dinining options, such as Flatiron / Madison Square Park. But take into account that this is my opinion, based on my travel style. I tend to like the downtown / southern areas of Manhattan a bit better in general because of for example being near a bunch of dining options that appeal to me. My top three criteria for choosing a hotel in NYC are:\\n* The hotel itself. Bed configuration, price point that works for me and the general \\'look\\' / \\'feel\\' of the hotel - some tend to appeal more to me than others.\\n* Being close to a subway station. Preferably several if possible. No more than 5 minutes to the closest.\\n* A variety of good local restaurants nearby.\\nJust sayin\\' so you know where my recommendation comes from. This is my reply to another post from April 23\\n“ have stayed at the Cambria Suites Chelsea numerous times over the past 5 years without issue and many times finding a great deal on the rates. This location is ideal for me as it’s an excellent base location for exploring NYC. You can easily hop on the subway or if you’re a walker like I am you can do that. There are two subway stops within a five minute walk, one is at the end of the block. It’s an easy 10 minute walk to the Empire State Building, the Flatiron District including Madison Square Park, Macy’s at Herald Sq. A 28 minute walk to Times Square, 25 minute to Chelsea Market and entrance to the Highline. Easy to get to Bryant Park, Central Park, Rockefeller Center or even Greenwich Village on foot if you enjoy and are able to walk a distance without issue. If miles of walking aren’t your thing just hop on the subway around the block. We’ve also taken the subway from here down to catch the Staten Island ferry . This hotel is located in the Flower District, which is a treat walking the area in the mornings when the shops set out their beautiful tropical plants and flowers onto the sidewalks. It’s quieter, away from the madness of Times Square. I have never felt unsafe here. The only negative with this property is that the bathroom sink is super tiny leaving little room to set out your toiletries but all else is great-clean decent sized room for NYC and a warm and welcoming staff. They’ll even hold your luggage on arrival and departure days.” What’s the event at Times Square now? Massive crowd\\nIs New York COVID free Support protest about what is happening in Colombia. NYC still has Covid, but restrictions are easing and hopefully will be gone by early July. Wow just like that. Thanks There is nowhere on Earth that is COVID-free, and that won\\'t be the case likely for years.\\nBut New York, like most of the US, has seen a massive drop in cases and deaths in the last month or two, thanks to growing vaccination numbers.\\nRestrictions, as noted, are being removed throughout the next several weeks, with NYC expected to fully reopen in every way by the start of Autumn. Case counts are going down and will likely stay low during the summer in NYC at least if last summer is an indicator. There will likely be additional surges in Fall and winter if enough people are not vaccinated and due to some of the variants. Broadway is Schedualed to Open on Sept 14, 2021\\nFor those who might be planning to come to NYC\\nNo idea what shows will be playing, but Likely Hamilton and Phanton of the Opera will be among them Tickets for Sept go on sale tomorrow; I\\'m assuming they will sell out very quickly with all the pent up demand. Seems Wicked, The Lion King and Hamilton will make a joint announcement\\nIts not clear if there will be tourists then (Meaning they will have to rely on locals) and how many people are willing to go to a crowded theater, perhaps wearing a mask That is encouraging news\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/theater/broadway-reopening-new-york.html Re #2 Well there had better be plenty of tourists then, as Bway, LincolnCenter etc local audiences tend to skew older and, unless we are told we have achieved something approaching herd immunity before then, there is likely to be resistance among them to go be crammed in with a bunch of strangers from god knows where and of uncertain vaccination status. A lot of people still have tickets for canceled performances, too. Since I’ve been vaccinated, I’m confident enough to go to shows unless things get out of control between now and then.\\nTickets for American Utopia have gone back on sale, too. A soft opening might be better, Maybe allow a few weeks to see how it goes with the crowds Not all shows will be opening at once, it will be staggered. I am planning on being in the city the end of Sept/end of Oct. Hoping to get tickets to at least a few shows. Every single one of my show tickets I had purchased for my trip last June were refunded without issue. Phantom has announced its performances will resume October 22, with tickets on sale May 7.\\nhttps://us.thephantomoftheopera.com/\\nBUY WITH CONFIDENCE\\nBuy tickets for THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA now for any performance through January 17, 2022 and you can either refund or exchange your tickets into any other date until two hours before the performance.\\nCOVID-19 SAFETY PROTOCOLS\\nBroadway is committed to providing healthy and safe facilities for audiences, performers, and staff. Based on CDC and New York State guidelines at the time of performance, protocols may include mask enforcement, increased cleaning and ventilation/filtration enhancements, vaccination or negative test verification, and more as developed by the theatre owners in conjunction with the State.\\nSTATE APPROVALS\\nThe anticipated opening date is subject to the approval of the NY State Department of Health and the Governor. The approval of the Department of Health and the Governor will be based on the continuing growth of the fully vaccinated population, coupled with an ongoing decline in total Covid 19 cases and positivity rates. The Department of Health and the Governor will review and approve health protocols in the theatre established by the theatre owner to assure that the highest safety standards are in place, as communicated through the theatre owners. Although it has yet to be approved (and will not be approved until closer to the Fall), the intention is that Broadway shows will be able to perform to full capacity. Glad to hear there is light at the end of the tunnel. Hello all\\nI hope you are fine, I\\'d like to ask about the possibility of obtaining a prepaid card with my\\npassport upon arrival? so as to avoid using cash money\\nIs that feasible, keeping in mind that I will be staying at hotel not apartment in case the bank\\nneeds a fixed address\\nthanks Apply for a card at your bank back home? Going to need more info. I have no idea what \"getting a prepaid card with my passport\" means. Why are those two things linked?\\nGetting a cash card at home does seem like the best option. Do banks there ask for an address or just for the money for the card? Any card with a Visa or Mastercard logo will work. What is your goal here?\\nIn the US prepaid cash/debit cards (in preset amounts) with the logos of major credit card companies can be obtained at retail stores without any need for identification (they are basically gift certificates)\\nIf you want some sort of card to use for travel expenses look to see if something similar to https://www.caxtonfx.com/ (which is popular with UK visitors) is available in your country\\nOpening an account with a bank will be complicated and not something a temporary visitor should need/want to do\\nIt sounds as if you may be planning to arrive carrying substantial cash - that is not a good idea Thanks for your reply\\nI appreciate your advice\\nThanks For anyone who was familiar with the New York City Ballet in the 70s and later, Jacques D\\'Amboise just passed away.\\nI can recall seeing him perform. Another era recedes. I am so sorry about this. He was a terrific guy and will be greatly missed. Many of the people commenting on the NY Times website are people who encountered him as children, often in NYC public schools, through his National Dance Institute programs.\\nActually, although he was a busy, vital guy throughout his life, people are not likely to have seen him dance much after the late 70s, early 80s, when he was already in his 40s and usually appeared to partner Suzanne Farrell. I saw him a couple times in the mid-late 70s and it was I think always to partner Farrell. He actually joined Balanchine\\'s company as a teen in the 40s and his peak years were probably in the 50s and 60s, when Balanchine created several roles for him.\\nEdited: 1:27 am, May 05, 2021 He also did some Broadway and appeared in a number of movie musicals, and some people apparently remember him for that more than his ballet. Thanks for that info Grandrue, I appreciate it. I did see him with Suzanne Farrell, as I had a subscription to the (Balanchine) NYC Ballet in 1976 or so. The extension will connect the Q train with 4,5, and 6 at 125th St.\\nhttps://www.rtands.com/passenger/new-york-citys-second-avenue-subway-project-is-back-on/?utm_source=&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=25188 Interesting\\nApparently this is Phase 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Second_Avenue_Subway#Phase_2\\nNew section shown as dotted orange line on the map here http://web.mta.info/capital/phase2_about_sas.html For those who aren\\'t familiar with this project, this new bit will extend the current line north of its current northern terminus at 2d & 96th, not south of 63rd &Lex. If it were to be extended south on Second Av below E 63, that would likely be decades away, if ever. Prepandemic even with it starting at 96th street the train gets pretty full within the first two stops. Prior to the Q line opening up, the 4/5/6 lines would come into 86th street and be soo full that people couldn\\'t even board the trains. That is common on 6 line. I have had to wait for as many as 2 or 3 trains to pass to board the 6 at 77th or 68th. \"That is common on 6 line. I have had to wait for as many as 2 or 3 trains to pass to board the 6 at 77th or 68th.\" Has that stopped since the Q service started? I primarily use the Q line since it opened. Prior to that I was using either the 4/5 or 6 line depending on how far I needed to travel. What are the odds that they\\'re going to do anything more than dig a giant hole in Harlem, leave it for several years, and fill it in? They\\'ve done that before. Yeah Eric, that reminds me, where\\'s that Staten Island subway connection to the rest of the city?\\nOh right, that\\'s exactly what happened there. I believe everything but the fill it in part. I\\'m still recovering from the constant blasting for the 2nd ave line. Yes, I have had that experience since the Q opened. Not since the pandemic, but before the pandemic and after the Q opened. I was surprised. #6 They already have a giant abandoned hole. I believe they put a tunnel in there running north from E 96 to about E 120 in the 60s or 70s.

We are staying in the city at the New Yorker Hotel. I have been into the city a fair amount of times and know how crowded Time Square can be especially at let out time of broadway shows. I was wondering without those occuring and there being very limited international tourists in the city right now, how is Time Square now crowds wise and is getting around it not to bad especially for some older folk with some mobility issues. It\\'s much easier to get around there nowadays. There used to be a couple of Times Square (note the \\'S\\' on Times, it\\'s named for the newspaper) webcams that you could see the traffic. Probably still are some While it\\'s getting busier (esp depending on day/night of week) I think it\\'s still a lot less busy than a year ago. However, that could change once we get into warmer weather, when l think it will be more busy with more people coming, including Europeans who believe most restrictions between US and Europe will be gone soon.\\nEdited: 4:38 pm, May 06, 2021 Times square has a number of people passing through it but it is nowhere close to what it was pre-pandemic where you were basically shoulder to shoulder with people as you tried to walk through, so right now at least it still has a number of people but you can easily walk through it and have plenty of space. The Broadway crowds contribute a lot to the crowding situation in the times square area. It\\'s looking a little more crowded now, based on the webcams.\\nTake a look and keep looking up to your trip date and judge how crowded you feel it will be for you.\\nhttps://www.earthcam.com/cams/newyork/timessquare/?cam=tsrobo3 Broadway is not reopening until mid September so it won\\'t be as busy IMNSHO until then. The Hotel Pennsylvania was the largest hotel in the world when it opened and was notable for having a bathroom attached to each guest room instead of \"down the hall.\" It was designed by the architects of Penn Station who gave it an imposing two-story lobby. Most of the grand public spaces were altered over the years. Railroad tracks run through the hotel\\'s basement. As was typical of its era, some of the rooms could be quite small. I once stopped by the room of a visitor and found his room was little larger than the bed. Places do become obsolete and this is one of them. For some reason, this hotel reminds me of signs I saw back in 1973 on benches by the Thames advising that \"verminous men\" were not allowed to sit there. The only time I was ever beyond the lobby of the Pennsylvania was sometime in the previous century when a west coast friend was in town for an event at Javits center (He chose it because it was the cheapest and in walking distance.)\\nThe room was a decent size but had very shabby not quite broken furniture, a bathroom that looked like it could never be properly cleaned and walls painted a muddy brown that had several dinner plate sized areas of missing plaster.\\n#2 - Fox I hope you took a photo of that sign 7 May - Harlem Nights Comedy Open Mic\\nIf you\\'re looking for a good place to try new material, come uptown to Harlem nights.\\nhttps://eventseeker.com/venue/1269866-harlem-nights-new-york\\n--\\n7 May - Craig Harris and Harlem Night songs - Guest Artist - Jason Marshall\\nIn this highly‐anticipated concert, hear the mellifluous sounds of jazz by Ellington, Davis, Lena Horne, Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald at New York\\'s treasured and world‐renowned Greater Calvary Baptist Church.\\nhttps://www.classictic.com/en/harlem_jazz_series/68516/979228/?amount=1&category=441505\\n--\\n11 May - Dripsets Park show\\nDo you love comedy?

The 1st thing I would suggest is to get ahold of a map or guidebook & divide your trip between the two days.be aware that you mean by the Statue of Liberty is to get on the Statue Cruises ferry, most of us suggest the trip will take half a day & the Met Museum can take up to two days depending on how much you want to see. It will be a little tight but things like Washington Square Park and Battery Park will just be walk throughs which will help.\\nI would aim to get into the city as early as possible, why waste time. The more time you have, the better.\\nOn you first day I\\'d drop the bags then head straight up to Central Park. Weather permitting. Then go to the Met. Afterwards, check in at the hotel and have some dinner then head to the M&M store. It\\'s open until 9.00pm I think. In between grab some food for lunch.\\nOn the next day, head to Battery Park and the SOL (or vice versa). Try and get first tickets of the day for the SOL. The crowds are less and you\\'ll have more time in the day later. Then head up to the Village, Washington Square Park and the High Line. The High Line is open until 9.00pm at the moment so you have plenty of time.\\nThe longer you spend at the SOL the less time you\\'ll have later in the day.\\nNote that on weekends you\\'ll have to make free timed reservations for the High Line due to covid. They recommend getting those in advance because there are limited tickets on the day.\\nhttps://www.thehighline.org/visit/\\nHope you enjoy.\\nEdited: 5:25 pm, May 06, 2021 Hi everyone. My son and I are coming to visit week after next. I realized that a lot of the items on his bucket list were things that we could use Citypass for. I haven\\'t crunched the numbers yet, but if it DOES save us money-- here\\'s the question.\\nWhen I go to reserve entry times for museums, does anyone know how do I use my Citypass to pay for these tickets?\\nAlso I noticed that Groupon has a Citypass for even less money. Any pitfalls to purchasing this way?\\nmany thanks :) Karen The main issue with any attraction passes is that you can\\'t reserve times so you could get to the venue & discover that the time you want is either sold out or the whole day is sold out especially during these times when capacity is limited. I think, since covid, they may have established a way to book on line using the pass https://www.citypass.com/guide/new-york/howto I\\'m travelling to NYC for 2-ish days in late June with 2 kids (ages 6, 9). We\\'ve all been there before, but there is a wish list of places missed on previous trips. I have a rough outline of an itinerary of where we\\'ll be. What I need help with is FOOD. I\\'d say $-$$ restaurants would fit the budget best. One kid is very picky (traditional American or American-Italian would work best for her), the other will eat almost anything. What would you suggest near these sights?\\nSunday:\\nMid-afternoon arrival; hotel is TBD, but probably in Times Square or Midtown area\\nDINNER\\nMonday:\\nBREAKFAST\\nMuseum of Natural History\\nLUNCH\\nCentral Park and zoo\\nSNACKS\\nRockefeller center and shopping\\nDINNER\\nTuesday:\\nBREAKFAST\\nStatue of Liberty and Ellis Island\\nLUNCH\\nBrooklyn (subway there, mostly Brooklyn Park area)\\nEARLY DINNER - maybe Juliana\\'s pizza?\\nBribe kids with ICE CREAM to walk back across bridge - maybe Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory?\\nWednesday:\\nBREAKFAST/BRUNCH\\nTrain to Philly (Penn Station)\\n*I know we\\'ll need to double check open dates/times due to COVID. All adults are fully vaccinated and the kids are pros at wearing masks at this point. I\\'ll do the homework, just hoping for a starting point. Thank you! If you decide to stay in the Times Square area, perhaps head a few blocks west and have dinner at Il Melograno?\\nhttps://www.ilmelogranonyc.com/menus/\\nIt\\'ll be easier to suggest places for breakfast near your hotel once that is decided. Checking yelp.com would be an easy way to discover the most highly rated places to eat near your chosen sites. Also EaterNY is a helpful website for finding special places. As a New Yorker this is how I find new places to eat all the tme\\nEdited: 12:55 am, May 06, 2021 I honestly get overwhelmed with the number of options on yelp, its hard to know where to start. I\\'ll check out the other site you mentioned. Thank you. It might also help if you would give us a budget in actual dollars not symbols which could mean different things to different people. Just to refine my answer above. It would be helpful if your budget is per entree & is also broken down into breakfast, lunch & dinner. While you didn\\'t ask, first I\\'m going to comment on location of hotel. There\\'s been a problem with homeless on the streets concentrated around Port Authority bus terminal (42 st. & 8th Ave,) and south toward Penn Station. Your itinerary doesn\\'t really require your staying near Times Square, but if you do, I\\'d try to stay in the west 50’s (rather than the 40’s) closer to Central Park. You could still walk to Times Square from there for a look.\\nThe Residence Inn Central Park and Courtyard Central Park are in the same building on 54 st. & Broadway/7 the Ave. Both have awesome views. The Residence Inn is on the higher floors, includes breakfast and has kitchens in the room. Rooms are small though. The Courtyard is on the lower floors, still has views but no included breakfast but slightly bigger rooms.\\nIf you stay in one of these, there\\'s a Shake Shack nearby for burgers for takeaway or Don Antonio is nearby for pizza. If you don\\'t have breakfast included, there\\'s a Pick A Bagel right nearby for breakfast as well as Bibble & Sip for coffee/tea and pastries. The Cosmic Diner is nearby for a more traditional breakfast (not great but ok.). There,s a Whole Foods inthe basement of the shops at Columbus Circle for take out. There may be shopping you,d like there too.🙂\\nhttps://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/columbuscircle\\nIf the kids like hot dogs, near the Museum and Central Park is Gray\\'s Papaya. A recession special of 2 hot dogs and a drink is $7.\\nhttps://grayspapaya.nyc/uptown-menu/\\nZabar\\'s is a gourmet deli up near the museum and a NYC institution. You could pick up sandwiches there and eat them in the park. Heck the menu and make sure the kids will like something there.\\nRockefeller Center has a food court. I don\\'t know what’s open and what’s not.\\nIn Brooklyn, in addition to Juliana\\'s there\\'s For ino in the park.\\nhttps://www.fornino.com/brooklyn-bridge-park\\nFor your last meal in NYC, La Grande Boucherie is near your hotel and has a large outdoor area. I\\'m guessing the prices are too high for you, but it would be a nice splurge. Bluedog Cookhouse is another idea.\\nNote, you could also stay on the upper west side near the museum where it\\'s a bit less hectic andmore of a neighborhood feel. You could also stay down near the ferry to the Staiue and closer to Brooklyn. On Monday, you could check out the Loeb Boathouse cafe for lunch. It would easily fit into any plans of exploring the park between the Natural History Museym and Zoo.\\nThe cafe has some nice outdoor seating (no lake views - those are reserved for the fancy restaurant!) or you could get food to go and picnic in the park. It has a very reasonably priced menu with burgers, salads, etc.\\nEdited: 11:23 am, May 06, 2021 Why not go to Coney Island and eat Nathans Hot Dogs, that will work well for kids Coney Island is definitely an idea. I didn\\'t know if we\\'d have enough time (or energy) but I\\'ll take a closer look. Thanks so much for the breakdown (and hotel advice), nywhiz. This is exactly what I was looking for. Very helpful. The governors Ball which is a large Music Festival is taking place Sept 24-26 at Citifield. While this event probably wont appeal to the posters here, Its a sign NYC is re-opening and coming back\\nThis is a fairly large festival and they are being allowed to take place It\\'s changing to a plant-based menu due to environmental concern:\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/dining/eleven-madison-park-vegan-menu.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes Interesting to read. And it will be interesting to see how they adjust their prices, and what impact it has on their ratings. I’ve been listening to Chef Humm talk about it for the last hour and a half on Clubhouse. He said he wants to create “a new language and a new cuisine”. He compared it to what Miles Davis has done w jazz. And he talks about what “luxury” foods really are, in a time where previously known luxury items like caviar can be farmed cheaply. We\\'ve always appreciated what he does with vegetables and would frequently order the vegetable-focused things at NoMad restaurant, even though we are omnivores. They are just that good. Even at EMP, the veggies are a stand-out. It will be interesting to see what he does. This will be interesting to hear how the reviews will be. I loved my meal there - one of the best I\\'ve had ever (well duh at that price point it better be good). I still remember a great vegetarian menu meal at Per Se some years ago which was very inventive. If I think the price is right, I might very well try this concept out. Not that you got a lot of meat there, but I would have to pass. Although it was on the short list for Mrs. XB and mine 30th anniversary this year. And with Del Posto closed the list gets shorter. That\\'s a bold move. Not nearly as bold as comparing it to what Miles did for jazz though. I saw meals there cost $335 a person, Are people really going to pay $335 a person for Vegetables? There is always going to be the mindset that a meal isn\\'t worth paying for with there is no meat, which maybe 5 years ago I would have agreed with.\\nThe world is changing, and there is a realisation that we cannot carry on as before, and changing what we are eating will help with the climate change targets.\\nThere are many in the US won\\'t believe it is a thing, but the more high-end restaurants that change their focus surely can only be a good thing?\\nI personally wouldn\\'t pay $355 for a meal, but I\\'m probably more interested in finding a great veggie / vegan meal these days than a steak.\\nM As mentioned, I listened to him talk about this fir about an hour and a half. He talked about the luxury of, say, a carrot that was carefully cultivated and grown to enhance flavor, and prepared to coax the most out of it. They are making their own milks, fats, and oils to simulate butters and creams. They have been working months to craft their dishes. It’s a lot of money. But as he pointed out, traditionally luxurious items, like caviar, are now farmed or not so special.\\nI have to note that a number of years ago, I went to his restaurant (forgot what it was called) on the roof of the Nomad. I don’t eat meat and we told them that. It was a prix fixe, no options. Instead of making vegetarian dishes for us, or substituting items we can eat, they just took the protein, the main item, off half the dishes. So a lot of greens that felt empty, for a couple of hundred dollars. It was insulting. I’m intrigued to see that he is now going to craft dishes that actually work to make the vegetables the star. I’m not racing there, but intrigued to see the reviews. Given the amount of anti-Asian violence that has been happening, especially in broad day light, I am worried about my upcoming trip to NYC. Can people please provide their thoughts on how I can stay safe? My main concern is riding the subway after a Yankees game on Friday night. I won\\'t be able to carry any self defense items since my bag will be checked at the stadium. Please no common sense tips like, \"don\\'t go down alleys\"/\"don\\'t wave your wallet around\"/\"keep to yourself\". I know all that. I\\'ve had to live life not drawing attention to myself because of the color of my skin but we all know that doesn\\'t stop racism. Also, there has been a lot of Asian violence that doesn\\'t make national news so don\\'t tell me it\\'s a rare occurrence either. Thank you. I am not asian, but NYC is very safe for Asians, there are a lot of Asians here (Over 1 Million) most of them go about their business safely every day\\nDont belive all the news hype, Most people go through their days without incident All I can tell you is my close friend doesn\\'t give a second thought to being Asian living and getting out in NYC and she\\'s not the aloof type at all. From https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k4244193-The_Idiot_s_Guide_to_the_Subway_Revised_February_2011-New_York_City_New_York.html\\n\" If you would like to ask the conductor a question, or you feel more secure riding with him, you can position yourself on the platform to be where the conductor’s car will be when the train arrives. You can do this by looking for the “conductor boards”, which are black-and-white or black-and-yellow diagonally striped boards hanging from the ceiling in the center of the platform. Stand there and then just board that car when the train arrives.\"\\nBefore heading to the game check out the walking route options and note businesses that stay open late then choose a return walking route accordingly\\n(This is female in NYC 101)\\nEdited: 11:18 am, April 29, 2021 A few thoughts/suggestions that I hope don’t ring hollow coming from a non-Asian:\\n- Crowds are your friend. While I know there have been instances of onlookers standing by passively, in general, you will be safer if there are other people around you. Choose your subway car and where you stand on the platform accordingly.\\n- My running club has a large Asian membership and so safety is an ongoing concern - with women feeling doubly at risk. In terms of actual experiences...several of my teammates have experienced verbal harassment (the incidents of which I’m aware were actually early in the pandemic, not recently). One group had eggs thrown at them while coming back from an anti-hate demonstration. I mention these incidents not to stoke fear, on the one hand, or minimize your concerns, on the other, but to provide context/scale and a kind of report from the ground. The bottom line is, my Asian teammates continue to run, bike & ride public transit all over the city on a daily basis and while concerned, are not letting hate keep them from going out.\\n- The horrible thing is, most of the violent attacks have been directed at elders and people who are marginalized (or both). To the extent people “read” you as a middle-class tourist, you should be (relatively) safe.\\nI hope you have a great trip and are able to check back in to report on your experience of the city.\\nEdited: 12:55 pm, April 29, 2021 I am not Asian, but feel the city is generally safe. That said, the anti-Asian racism is very much a problem and I can see why someone might be concerned. The vast majority of the citizens abhor the violence, though, and many will defend people who are being hassled on account of their race. I would imagine the subway trains back from a Yankee game will be crowded with other baseball fans and that will provide protection. Many of the racist incidents here recently have been mentally disturbed and violent individuals preying on people walking alone. If the subway is a strong concern, you could also research taking the Metro North train to and from Yankee Stadium. Depending on where you\\'re staying, that is often a quicker way to get around and there are conductors circulating among the cars. I\\'m the last to fear-monger, but I have been on a couple trainsful of Yankee fans after a game, and it\\'s not always the best behaved group. More recently we have taken to leaving in the 8th inning so as to avoid the largest crowds -- there are plenty of folks on the earlier trains, and they are generally like minded people looking to beat the crowd and get back to Manhattan safely. Yes, it is. The best way to convince you is for you to check it out yourself and make your own opinion. Ah yes, ISD, the way I found out that yes, that stove WAS too hot to touch! :) I don\\'t where you\\'re staying or whether this would be feasible, but agree with suggestion you take Metro North commuter rail line instead of subway. That\\'s what I would do for safety reasons (and am not Asian). As far as Subway is concerned, lately, i have observed that Subways is starting to see pretty high ridership levels. So, i would say that Subway is pretty darn safe. Connecticut wants to Make Pizza the state food\\nPeople in NY (and NJ) are not happy about it (Its not well known, but NJ is the same Pizza as NY and Pizzerias are as common there as NY)\\nhttps://nypost.com/2021/02/03/critics-blast-bill-to-make-pizza-connecticuts-official-state-food/ I don’t think people in any state are too bothered about this.\\nI mean...it’s the New York Post...\\nIf the other states are really bothered by it, they could have grabbed pizza as their own “ state food”.\\nA quick Google shows Jersey has designated blueberries and tomatoes ( why do they get TWO??!?). New York is apples. The irony of this is that both of those politicians that are pushing this are originally from NYC. CT has a few very good pizza places, which are better than many of the NYC places, but overall the pizza in NYC is better. Its kind of astounding that they would try to make pizza the state food when there are some claims that hamburgers were invented in CT and also there are claims that heroes (grinders) were from there. The grinders are far far better than anything I have ever found in NYC. That is why it is astonishing they would opt for pizza of all things, but given the fact they both represent New Haven where there most of the higher profile pizza shops are located that would probably explain it. The best pizzas we have had in the tri-state area have always been in New Haven - at The Bar and of course at Pepe\\'s... may be we have not fully explored NJ / NY ......\\nBut state food for CT?.... I would rather they choose egg plant grinders... Oh c’mon. This is just the Post (and CT) trolling our governor. It’s a big game to see if he’ll take the bait at his next presser. I’m betting yes. #publicitystunt Considering the number of things said to have been invented in New Haven you\\'d think that there would be a good university there. Not Just the NY Post\\nhttps://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/lawmakers-propose-making-pizza-connecticuts-state-food/2413868/ Pepe\\'s really is THAT GOOD.

I\\'d welcome some insight and any other recommendations if anyone has. \"despite the fact that the Host assures me that he has the correct city permit to allow him to rent his apartment on Airbnb.\"\\nIn NYC there are no city permits of that kind https://www1.nyc.gov/site/specialenforcement/stay-in-the-know/about-illegal-short-term-rentals.page\\nTypically the advice is to plot out your sightseeing priorities on a map to get an idea of where you will spend most of your time.\\nHowever, if you consider a kitchen to be a necessity there are fewer apartment style hotels Consider whether you need a full kitchen, which will limit your options. There are lots of hotels that offer mini fridges and microwaves as standard options, or just “upon request”. One other option is Residence Inn Downtown / World Trade Center. I believe OP has previously stated they eat kosher. They may feel more comfortable with more kitchen for dietary reasons. The Upper West Side might also work better for you, there are plenty of Kosher Options there as well (At least before Covid) I doubt if they will be doing any \"real\" cooking as any pots/dishes/silverware provided by the hotel are unlikely to be suitable for for kosher use\\nFor light meals or takeout disposables will likely be used While searching for a hotel in September, I jotted down a few places with suites and kitchens for a future trip with my wife.\\nThese were three that I noted.

But I though I would share.\\nEdited: 1:45 pm, May 03, 2021 I try to balance the quality of the hotel, price and location. If you are looking for a full kitchen, then it will limit your choices. When I read reviews, I try to weigh the person\\'s complaints with what I prioritize. To me, cleanliness and safety are most important and I read many reviews where the complaints are that the front desk staff didn\\'t smile enough or they didn\\'t get a good enough upgrade even though they are a special customer, etc. I also don\\'t pay a lot of attention to someone who only has 1-2 reviews.\\nOf your choices, I have stayed in the Residence Inn Central Park and would recommend it. The location is very good and I had a nice stay though it was probably 3 years ago now. Take a look at the Affinia properties as well. There are three in Manhattan. The Shelburne is usually the cheapest and the Gardens the most expensive, but offers at any time can have good deals at all of them.\\nI don\\'t know if all of their rooms have a kitchen, most do, and they are well regarded hotels.\\nAlso check their Offers page to see if any offers will make it cheaper for you.\\nhttps://www.affinia.com/\\nBtw, the Residence Inn Central Park is a good hotel with kitchenettes, but rooms can be small. The corner rooms are the best and are a little bigger if you can get one of those. Elevators can be slow in peak times as well. Great location for a hotel though, close to subway and many sights.\\nAlso take a look at something like booking.com where you can filter your choices by amenities required, such as a kitchen, or which area you\\'d like to stay. Then check the hotel\\'s own website for comparison, and also reviews on TA. Looking for some advice to ensure my plan is doable and logical. For an October trip, four of us with well-traveled teen kids (their first visit to NY, my first time without taking a taxi or town car into the city).\\nWant to fly into EWR, then rent a car because we\\'re spending a few days in the Poconos. Then we\\'re going to spend the rest of the week in NYC, so I\\'m thinking we\\'d return the rental car to EWR and grab the AirTrain to Newark Penn Station, then take that to NY Penn Station. Is that the best option? Or would it be wiser to just take the AirTran to Penn the first day and rent a car from there? Rent the Car from Newark and drive to Poconos, don\\'t drive in Manhattan unless its absolutely nessasary If you are arriving at EWR and spending your first night in the Poconos (?) there is no good reason to take transit into Manhattan and then heading out of town\\nComparison price renting at EWR and returning near your hotel. Any cost difference may not be important when you consider transit costs and convenience\\nIf you return at EWR the best method to get into Manhattan may vary depending on the location of your hotel Sorry, will clarify. Going to Manhattan day 4 so only renting car days 1-4 (returning before Manhattan). Arriving EWR day 1, then driving to Poconos. Then spending day 4 onward in NYC - no car.\\nSo is it best to pick up and return rental at airport, then take AirTrain into Manhattan? (still working on hotel - most likely Midtown but not certain) Or take AirTrain day 1 to Penn Station and pick up / return rental there (which so far seems to be cheaper)?\\nBasically trying to get a sense of how easy it is to take AirTrain to/from airport and then Penn Station to/from Manhattan. We\\'ll very likely be flying out of EWR also.\\nEdited: 11:32 am, May 05, 2021 pick up / drop off rental at Penn Station Newark - not Pennsylvania Station New York to further clarify. Maybe that\\'s the confusion? It is easy to take the train from EWR to Penn and back. I don\\'t really know how much money you save by going into the city to get a rental car. You may need to pay tolls hen leaving and you will be burning a lot of time going there and dealing with the traffic trying to leave the city. Seems more reasonable to just rent from the airport and return the car there. If you want you can look into returning the car to a location near your hotel in the city and see how much more they will charge you for that.\\nEdited: 11:39 am, May 05, 2021 Also to clarify Heather L, the AirTrain is an automated monoraial that only goes to and from the terminals at EWR and the Newark Airport Rail station (with a few other stops at airport parking and car rental facilities). The AirTrain itself doesn\\'t go to Newark Penn Station or New York Penn Station. At the Newark Airport rail station you would take a NJ Transit or Amtrak train to either Newark Penn Station or continue on to New York Penn station.\\nEdited: 11:44 am, May 05, 2021 \"Or take AirTrain day 1 to Penn Station and pick up / return rental there (which so far seems to be cheaper)? \"\\nIs it truly cheaper after the cost of transit? Enough cheaper to be worth *several hours* of vacation time?\\nThe Airtrain is reasonably straightforward https://www.newarkairport.com/to-from-airport/air-train\\nDepending on your hotel location, if you return at EWR, transferring from the Airtrain to the PATH train (instead of NJT to Penn) might be a more convenient (and less expensive) option https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/schedules-maps.html\\nChoosing to return the rental in Manhattan depends on cost, convenience and driver comfort\\nThere is no one size fits all answer #4 Yes that is very different There\\'s no reason to rent the car in Manhattan. It\\'s out of the way and rental rates will be higher. So your choice is either renting on-airport at EWR, or off-airport (conceivably at Newark Penn Station.)\\nCompare rates. If it\\'s significantly cheaper off-airport then that\\'s what I\\'d do. However, rather than you all having to take the two trains to get to Newark Penn Station, your best bet for any off-airport location would be to take a local taxi from your terminal at EWR to the car rental site. This would not be a major travel complication.\\nFor the return of your car, price out the rental cost would be to return to your original rental location compared to a return near your hotel in Manhattan. Be sure to add the toll you\\'d have to pay to get into Manhattan on one of the Hudson River crossings, either bridge or tunnel.\\nEdited: 12:29 pm, May 05, 2021 DHC518 - thank you!! (When I look up how to get to Manhattan from EWR the AirTrain comes up as the first stage of the route and from there to Penn Station (NJ). The Newark Liberty Airport Station is the missing link/transfer. )\\nAre there any car rentals located near the Newark Liberty Airport Station? I don\\'t want to have a huge hassle when we return it, since we won\\'t be flying. Don\\'t know if we\\'ll be able to enter the airport area to access the train without a ticket. If it\\'s near that station at least we have a way to get to Amtrak/ NJ Transit without dealing with the airport again.\\nTo clarify again, here\\'s what I\\'m trying to do:\\nEWR-> car rental -> Poconos -> return car -> Manhattan\\nSimply trying to figure out where it makes sense to rent / return car and then how to get to Manhattan from there. Hoping for the least complicated journey. My friend and I are visiting the city next month and were trying to make reservations. We can\\'t decide between Keens, Gallaghers, or do y\\'all have a better alternative? You probably will get a ton of suggestions listing great steakhouses. There are differences, but unless you have years to explore them, you will not figure out what is best for you. Keens generally enjoys higher ratings than Gallagher’s, but both will deliver a great steak. I consider two factors: location and whether members of group will be turned off by frat boy atmosphere that permeates a few steak houses. Not a problem with your two choices. Bottom line: pick one and enjoy. You really cant beat the wood fired steaks at Gallagher\\'s, better atmosphere at Del Frisco\\'s IMO. I\\'m really not a fan of dining in the Times Square area, but while the theatres still remain closed you may be able to enjoy your dinner without being rushed. The West Side Steakhouse on 10th btwn 43/44th is also very good, more casual, less expensive and very good steaks! Just make sure you do your research to confirm they will be open when you want to go and make a reservation. Some in my neighborhood are not yet open or look like they are getting ready to open. Also note that some that used to be open for both lunch and dinner may now be open only for dinner.\\nEdited: 1:22 pm, May 05, 2021 I haven\\'t been to Texas in a very long time and I\\'ve never been to Lubbock, but I\\'m guessing you have great steak there, so having steak in NYC might be more about the atmosphere and maybe the history of the place? We don\\'t know whether you,re male or female (which can make a difference at a steakhouse) , what cuts of meat you like, what\\'s important to you and whether price is an issue.

I wonder if the bedbugs will hitch a ride with the rats? :P So having rather disappointingly cancelled our Airbnb I\\'ve now spent the last couple of days looking at hotel options and I think I\\'ve come to the conclusion that this hotel best serves our needs. We\\'re 2 people (in our 50\\'s) travelling to New York for 11 days in March 2022. We wanted something other than just a bed and a bathroom and the addition of the kitchenette in the Residence Inn appeals to us together with the size of the room (30m) which is a lot bigger compared to many other hotels. I\\'ve read several mixed reviews on TripAdvisor and I just wanted to know what some of you New York experts think. I have never stayed there - so can only comment on the location - which I think is good as a base for a sightseeing trip (just a block from Bryant Park - and close to mass transit options).\\nI\\'ve had great experience with the Marriott brand in general - but for recent and specific info on that particular hotel - I think your note about reading traveler reviews is the best way to get that insight.\\nEdited: 11:40 am, May 04, 2021 Actually a friend, who is a travel agent, said to me that there are basically 3 types of TripAdvisor reviewers - those who complain about the stupidest thing and give a place a low score; those who have a wonderful time and want to sing it from the rooftops; and those who would never think of writing a review for TripAdvisor despite using their services - I\\'m not sure how accurate that is - I\\'ve written reviews - good and bad. I have stayed there twice, and would happily stay again. There are no bad views as the lowest room is about the 30th floor (there is another hotel below that). Obviously some rooms are larger than others, so keep your eye on square footage, 30sq/m is a decent room size. The kitchen was more than enough for basic needs, included breakfast was decent. I really enjoyed the location, walking to lots and north enough of Times Square to not be in that madness. Central Park is very close, and that is a main focus for me. I think she is asking about the RI at 6th Ave & 39th not the one farther north near Central Park Are you dead set on that particular area? I keep mentioning the Residence Inn Downtown / World Trade Center here every now and then since I\\'ve stayed there and I know they have decent room sizes too. Could be worth comparing prices to the one you do have booked already. I really liked the idea of staying Downtown and liked the look of the Artezen hotel but I was advised to go for location over hotel. Not sure which way to go now. I just checked the price of the Downtown Residence Inn for my dates and it\\'s more than double the price of the Manhattan/Times Square one! I think it’s “ok.” But given your budget, it may be the only decent option. Do you realize it\\'s actually closer to Bryant Park than Times Square? (A good thing imo, but maybe not to you.) I don\\'t think there are any decent supermarkets nearby. There are quite a few other hotels with kitchens or kitchenettes but they all seem to be much more expensive. Ah, if the downtown one is much more expensive than the TS one I can see the appeal to spend less and use that money to do something fun in town. Though I personally like the location of the downtown one a lot, saving on staying and being able to spend more while in town is very appealing. Yes, like others have said the one you\\'ve chosen is closer to Bryant Park than Times Square. Better in my book too, like Whiz mentions. Regarding Bryant Park and supermarkets, isn\\'t there a Whole Foods right across 6th Av from the west side of Bryant Park? Admittedly not your normal supermarket, and not cheap, but better than a bodega in my opinion. To get a regular supermarket would have to travel some distance either east or west, perhaps using 42d st crosstown bus, to vicinity of 42d & 2d or 42d & 9th. We are staying in Vernon, NJ. We will have a car. We have 1 full day to sight see and are not sure if we should no into NCY or visit some other place. Any suggestions? Two adults and a teen. Where are you coming from? Have you ever been to NYC before? What does your teen want to do? What are your chances of returning again for a longer period? Do you enjoy sightseeing or is nature more your thing? What time of year? Would you rather just go to the beach?\\nIt is hard to tell someone what to do without knowing what your interests are. Vernon is a 2 hour drive from NYC. Vernon has a decent amount of attractions from Mountian Creek, to Crystal Springs. Also about 20-30 minute drive is High Point State Park. https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g46885-Vernon_New_Jersey-Vacations.html\\nAbve is a link to the TripAdvisor Vernon NJ website. I agree that you should check out the attractions nearby rather than attempting a day trip to a huge city which may overwhelm by trying to do too much in a short period.\\nEdited: 3:28 pm, May 03, 2021 If you want to visit the city for one day, you can take in quite a bit. It will be a long day and hopefully it won\\'t be a weekday. You can take Route 23 south to either Route 80 east to go to the GWB, or take Route 23 south to Route 46 east to Route 3 East to Rout 495 East to the Lincoln Tunnel. As mentioned, you\\'re looking at an approximately 2 hour drive. An early weekend day would be best.\\nI would drive into the city, park at a garage and have a list of things you wan to see/do.\\nAnother option is to drive to a NJ Transit train station, I\\'m not that familiar with them that far outside of the city, but I believe that Denville has one.\\nWhat are you interested in seeing, that might help to narrow things down a bit. Ok, Vernon, NJ isn’t a hot bed of fun compared to NYC and I’m a Jersey girl. The ride in could take a bit more than an hour, two hours or longer depending on day of the week and time. However, I wouldn’t let that stop you - we do plenty of 12 hour days in NYC. When are you visiting and from where? Strangers on the internet can\\'t possibly give you advice without knowing anything about you, whether you\\'re likely to come back to the area to see NYC some other time, whether you,re all healthy, if you all want to see NYC etc. we son\\'t even know where you live. We are coming from the Midwest in 2 weeks. We are all healthy and able. My husband and son have never been to NYC so I kind of want them to experience it, but not sure that one day will be worth all the effort. In which case, perhaps finding something to do in NJ for the day would be a better option. Looking for adventure, outdoors, shopping, fun attractions. What day of the week do you have to do this? That will make a difference in traffic.\\nFor shopping, you\\'re 40 mins. away from a popular outlet mall called Woodbury Commons. There are other things to see and do near there. Here\\'s a link to the website with other things listed. Storm King Art Center is just a bit further north and worth seeing.\\nhttps://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/woodbury-common/travel-here\\nAerules has given you some ideas for outdoor activity and Blume way baby has given you a link for other things in the area.\\nI agree with Springerandy that you can see quite a bit in a day if you’re up for the drive to NYC. Another thought is to stay one night in a hotel closer to NYC if you don\\'t think you\\'re likely to get back east any time soon. If that,s an option and you want help finding some place to stay, post back.\\nIf you decide yo do want to visit NYC and want help with what to see and do, post back. I think driving to a train station to shorten the drive is another good idea.\\nEdited: 10:15 am, May 05, 2021 One day in NYC is certainly worth it . I do it often and I frequently take out of the area visitors in for a day visit. I am accustomed to Manhattan driving but if you aren\\'t then the suggestions to take the train is a good idea.\\nEdited: 10:28 am, May 05, 2021 I need a 2-bedroom hotel room for privacy issues. Ok to share a bath.\\nAny ideas? I find rooms with multiple beds but that won’t work. Try searching for hotels with connecting rooms.\\nOr, more expensively, suites. A one bedroom with a nice pull out - won’t work? There are hotels with 2 bedroom suites but they will be very pricey and are usually set up for families with children (i.e. second bedroom may have 2 beds.).\\nAffinia Gardens\\nRadiocityapartments.com\\nBeaconhotel.com\\nMarmara East Side\\nResidence Inn Times Square\\nThe Kimberly\\nBest Western Hospitality\\nare some of the hotels that have had 2 bedroom suites. I’m arriving next week in JFK around 4:30 pm and heading to Midtown Manhattan. Has anyone used Carmellimo airport service? They charge $50. I know taxi price is about the same but taxi seems to have added charges. I’m an older women traveling alone and looking for convenience and reliability. Any suggestions? I am in the same situation & I would just take a cab from the authorized dispatcher at the end of the taxi line (noone else,) That way you don\\'t have to look around for your ride which for an older lady with disabilities can signat that you are an easy mark. Besides, this company is trying to undercut the official cab price which means that you could be charged extra when you get to your hotel. Both the Yellow cab and FHV prices will be before tip, airport access fees, congestion fees, misc surcharges and possible tolls https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/passengers/taxi-fare.page Carmel is legitimate. (You can also Google for a discount code - it’s usually $3-4, you have to tell them you have it when you book). It is sometimes a bit of a pain to find the car, depending where you arrive, while the cab line is clear.\\nI often take a Carmel car TO the airport but a cab from the airport to manhattan. I would agree with message above Book a car to get back to the airport\\nIf you are on the street with a suitcase searching a yellow cab you can be ignored especially at peak times\\nApparently once a taxi stops they have to do the ride?\\nA track to the airport at rush hour is not a welcome ride\\nWe always use Dial 7 and they have never let us down but book BOTH trips at once\\nEnjoy Hoping to get there with my daughter for our annual trip Fingers crossed April 9-12, 2021\\n1,499 pictures taken on my cell phone\\n28 hours of walking\\n36.4 miles walked NYC April 9-12, 2021\\n11 hours spent r/t on a bus to/from VA\\n$795.45 spent =\\n($173.36 food/tips; $506.40 hotel; $44 museums; $57.69 cabs (3 rides); $14 misc.)\\nI am not a material girl, but a collector of moments and memories. Thank you once again NYC! Oh, how I had missed you!\\nI honestly don\\'t know of any one of my friends or family that can keep up with me in terms of walking on my trips. My youngest daughter, who is also my #1 travel partner, comes close; but honestly I believe there have been times on our trips where she stuck it out for me. IMO traveling solo puts me in a different frame of mind. It allows me to fully immerse myself in the world before me without interruption. While many desire the company of others, I enjoy the silence over conversing with a walking partner.\\nOn each of my NYC trips, I take a great deal of time planning my walking routes, using the Google Pegman to help me find the more interesting route than the suggested by scanning the street scenes. I have Lyme disease and sometimes my brain isn\\'t as sharp as it should be, especially when tired. I type up my walking directions in larger font to print out which helps to keep me on the right track should I get disoriented during my walks.\\nDay 1- I arrived 3 hours later than the usual time I do via the VAMoose Bus from VA/MD. Due to COVID, the buses depart an hour or two later. A smooth, easy 5.5 hour ride with two other pick-up stops on a bus less than half filled with masked passengers and driver. I was able to hail a cab quickly upon arrival and was on my way for my first stay in the FiDi. Check-in was a breeze and I quickly dropped my luggage, gathered items needed for my walking and off I went. The later arrival had me feeling like I needed to rush to see what I wanted before it got dark (kind of like me being Cinderella and my coach turning into a pumpkin at midnight). It was 3:03pm when my feet hit the pavement to begin my sightseeing. Due to the later start, I took a cab from the Artezen Hotel up to Chinatown to begin my walk. I wanted to see the new StopAsianHate Mural on Chrystie St and check out the murals at First Street Green Cultural Park.\\nhttps://www.graffitistreet.com/stop-asian-hate-mural-new-york-city-2021/\\nhttps://www.firststreetgreenpark.org/\\nI am fascinated by the simplest of things and there is always something that catches my eye. I giggled as I spotted a poster of Mr. Potato Head (now Potato Head) with a bright pink sex toy in his hand. And then warmth filled my heart when I read a handwritten note on a Whole Foods Bag taped to a pole; proving there is still good in the world. ”3/26/21-To the kind person who loaned me money at Whole Foods last night when my chip card failed I want to repay you. But I’ve lost your name and phone number. Please see Mahanie, mgr at NoMad, holding envelope w.money. Thank you again. (Tell Mahanie to call me if you want to have a drink.)”.\\nI am quite certain that people who watched me stop off every few steps photographing something wondered what in the heck I was doing. I didn’t care, I was enjoying every moment of it. I came across numerous mosaic tiled light posts along the East Village Mosaic Trail and paused even more looking at all of the detailed work. I was working my way up to Astor Place via Abe Lebewohl Triangle/Stuyvesant St. for my first meal at Shake Shack. Temperature checks and contact tracing info collected for dining in, which I did and it was just as tasty as it always is.\\nhttps://gothamtogo.com/on-the-mosaic-trail-with-jim-power-the-mosaic-man-in-the-east-village/\\nhttps://www.boweryboyshistory.com/tag/astor-place\\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/abe-lebewohl-park/history\\nLeaving Shake Shack the skies opened up, though no rain was forecasted, so I stopped into K-mart and bought a rain poncho. It ended up being far better than my Columbia rain jacket and it was needed for most of my trip. I was pretty disappointed that Mother Nature decided to rain on my parade. I tucked my nice Nikon camera under the poncho and never used it again, only my iPhone. I headed towards Washington Square Park, stopping at Washington Mews and Deutsches Haus for photos. It was then that I realized how fortunate I was. My last visit was December 2019 and it was my fourth visit during that year. How lucky I was to be back! I would not melt in the rain and I was being petty over such a minor inconvenience. I was in NYC once again and the rain wasn’t going to dampen my plans. Many people were huddled under the arch at WSP taking cover from the rain and others were scrambling to cover what they had on display for others to see. It wasn’t as lively as it would have been if it were dry it. But I discovered on this trip, many times over due to rainy days, that with the rain comes puddles and with puddles come the coolest reflections for photographing.\\nhttps://row-house-living.com/2012/02/20/washington-mews-in-greenwich-village-ny/\\nhttps://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/research-centers/deutscheshaus/about/history-of-deutsches-haus.html#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201970s%2C%20Deutsches,open%20to%20the%20general%20public.\\nhttps://washingtonsqpark.org/history/\\nLoads more photos taken as I walked, stopping at Electric Lady Studios (Jimmy Hendrix fame), Jefferson Market Library/Gardens, Waverly Place and an ice cream stop at Van Leeuwen\\'s for their Dulce de leche & shortbread cookie flavor.\\nhttp://electricladystudios.com/studios/\\nhttps://www.nypl.org/about/locations/jefferson-market\\nhttps://forgotten-ny.com/2011/11/a-walk-on-waverly-place/\\nhttps://vanleeuwenicecream.com/scoop-shops/#newyork\\nAs I approached Christopher Park I could hear sounds in the near distance of a violin. Following the music, knowing that something exciting was happening, I came upon a small gathering of people, some in costume, including a puppeteer with a music box. It was an introduction to an immersive theatrical walking experience that was about to begin- Voyeur-The Windows of Toulouse-Lautrec. (Here’s a news clip about it). My heart beamed with excitement as I recorded a short snippet and took photos to share with my 75 year old mother. A lover of TL, his art and his story, she would have been delighted to experience this performance strolling through Greenwich Village, a place that captured her heart when she was just a teenager. It also made be a bit sad thinking of what a wonderful time we could have had were she there with me at that moment in time. I discovered my love for NYC in 2014, at a time when my mother spent a great deal of time working her butt off while tending to the needs of her aging mother. A mother/daughter trip to NYC has never really been an option for us, but maybe in the near future it could be. It’s probably been 27 plus years since she and her best friend walked from the Upper East Side all the way down to Battery Park in the middle of a NYC snowstorm and loved every frozen moment of it. When she talks about it, you can see that the adventure is still fresh in her soul.\\nhttps://unmakinglautrecplay.com/gallery\\nhttps://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/02/19/-voyeur--the-windows-of-toulouse-latrec----part-walking-tour--part-performance-art-theater-piece\\nContinuing my walk I stopped off at St. Luke’s Place, a beautiful tree-lined street of brownstone townhouses. I would think that now with the Wisteria in bloom, it would be far prettier than just the green I saw. I love street art, especially murals, so I stopped by City-As-School to see the murals there. I had plans on getting some sweet treats from Dominique Ansel’s, but there was a line inside, so I opted to keep moving on. I’ve tried several of their signatures items, though never a cronut, and have waited in lines down the sidewalk in the past. I also love architecture, including beautiful churches. When route planning I came across Our Lady of Pompeii Church on Google maps, so I made sure to include it on my walk. My NYC bucket list goals would be to walk every street of NYC at least once and on this day I covered new territory and that made me happy, but there’s so much more exploring to do.\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/2008/07/walking-new-york-st-lukes-place.html\\nhttps://abc7ny.com/mural-west-village-manhattan-city-as-school/4625394/\\nhttps://www.dominiqueanselny.com/\\nhttps://www.olpnyc.org/history-of-the-church\\nI was wowed by the cast-iron facades on the cobblestoned Greene Street in SoHo as I made my way downward for my dinner stop at Anejo Tribeca. I had originally planned on dining in, but it was getting later and I was a mess, having been rained on and damp. My experience here was a complete flop and luckily the only dining disappointment on this trip. I was told it would take about 20-30 minutes for my to-go order of two chicken tacos. That wait turned into an hour and was completely disorganized as the hostess appeared to be training someone. My order sat on the bar for a lengthy time after asking if it was ready. When I was finally told that it was ready, my credit card was taken and brought back for a signature, yet my order still sat at the bar. I had to ask for my food and again it took more time. The bag felt extremely light. I had a bad feeling that upon return to my hotel whatever was in the box wouldn’t be the great meal I was hoping for, but remained optimistic.\\nhttps://www.wired.com/2015/08/maps-economics-greene-street-new-york-city/\\nhttp://anejotribeca.com/menu/dinner/\\nI made my way down Church Street as One World TC slowly disappeared in the heavy cloud covered skies before me and the buildings and streets twinkled with lights. The Woolworth Building, stunning enough in daylight, had such a bright golden glow in the sky above it as if the heavens above were responsible for that. How grand it would be to live in that building. An end of the night surprise was seeing St. Paul’s Chapel and churchyard grounds lit up, giving it a completely different look than during the day. I made it back to my hotel room at 8:04 pm and definitely looked like Cinderella after midnight in her rags, rather than ball gown, but it was an almost perfect first day. I got in 5 hours/7.7 miles that day. And yes, the two chicken tacos were a disaster. Burnt, rubbery tortillas with a small amount of chicken and toppings, not really even a meal for $15, excluding taxes and tip. My belly was hungry, but I was ready for bed.\\nhttps://www.6sqft.com/secrets-of-the-woolworth-building/\\nhttps://thewoolworthtower.com/\\n***I didn’t go into detail about my Artezen experience, but here’s my review if you’d like to read it\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d15237449-r786476579-Artezen_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html Your detailed report is wonderful LOVE the links.

Looking forward to riding the rest of your trip report! :) What a great report! I loved all the detail, can’t wait to read more. (Sorry about the tacos.) Love love your report with details and links! Oh, how I miss the city.\\n\\'... traveling solo puts me in a different frame of mind. \\' - > So. Very. True. This made me nod in agreement. As someone who is a very slow walker, I find it generally much easier to sightsee on my own so I can pace what I see, what I do and immerse myself in all the things I enjoy. Being an introvert helps too.\\nYou\\'ve done some exciting things. Keep it coming. Off to read your hotel review now, since that is a hotel I have kept an eye on since it opened. Loving your trip report keep it coming! awesome trip and report.. Thanks for writing. Thank you all! I promise the rest of the trip report, in parts, will be coming as soon as I can find some free time to do so. I\\'ve been reading so much conflicting information about all of the shuttle companies that I\\'m leaning towards public transport. However, when we thought we were staying 5 minutes from Penn Station this was going to be an easy journey but now being near Bryant Park I feel it\\'s much more complicated and possibly involves more \"schlepping\" of luggage.\\nSo can someone tell me what the best way is to get from Newark to Bryant Park and if it involves trains and subway are there elevators or do we have to physically carry our luggage up flights of stairs? Why not just go to Penn station and then take a cab outside. Use the taxi stand on 8th and 33rd. It will be a short ride.\\nEdited: 2:45 am, May 05, 2021 Agree with hybrid transit plan suggested by red259 in post 1.\\nEdited: 2:51 am, May 05, 2021 Great idea, thank you.

It is like 10 blocks. Three days in NYC in April as part of a college road trip. 2 nights at the Courtyard Marriott Soho and one night at Moxy East Village after a Washington DC visit.\\nCourtyard Marriott was walkable to Soho and to the Village. First night we did a LOT of walking around and soaking in the neighborhoods. It was warm and tons of people eating outside. We stopped at Babs for dinner because there was one outside table open on the end, away from the others. A little pricey, but higher quality. The fries that came with teen’s burger were lightly crunchy on the outside and pillowy inside; I liked my salad but those fries were memorable.\\nNext day it poured and we were busy with other appointments in the morning. Teen HAD to go to Washington Sq Park and try a game with one of the chess players. He was undeterred by the rain but the chess players obviously were not and so that did not work out. Had a damp and mediocre lunch under the awning of a Le Pain Quotidien a couple blocks away and then off to a Fordham Bronx visit in the afternoon. Fordham allowed families to walk only in a circle around the small lawn in the center of campus without a tour guide. So we really could not see much and we were drenched and cold.\\nBack to hotel to catch up on some work, so we did take out from a nearby Shake Shack which was also mediocre.\\nNext day, off to DC. Three days later, returned to NYC because spouse forgot a piece of luggage at the Courtyard and they were super nice and held it for him. Checked into the Moxy East Village. Liked this area a lot. Will stay here again. Very neighborhoody feel. It was a beautiful day and son finally got to play his chess games. The Park was chock full of people and there were musicians, roller skaters, etc.; so nice to see people finally! We walked a lot around the EV and happily settled on dinner outside at Veselka. Hearty food and atmosphere and it’s been on my “to eat” visit for a long time.\\nNext day, hit up nearby Westside Market for some whitefish and salmon spreads and Tompkins Square Bagels for a bag to take home, followed by a visit to Le Fournil. If you are missing a canceled trip to France this year, go here. The baguette was crunchy on the outside with that delicious, glutinous texture on the inside which is absolutely missing from just about every baguette I have ever tried in the US. Croissants were equally addictive. I think about this bakery literally every day and have to go back now.\\n(FYI, Fordham was surprisingly a “no” for teen. I think the crappy weather for the tour was a factor, unfortunately). Forgot to add, we were all fully vaccinated. Glad to hear you liked the Moxy East Village. Haven\\'t stayed there, but I do love the location and the area. Thanks for your report. I haven’t been to BABS - looks amazing. A few weeks ago I mentioned I was craving sardines. Do you know if the ones there are fresh or canned? Don’t you love the outdoor seating and party atmosphere in the Village?\\nSad about the wasted mediocre meals...so frustrating. Come back soon! Good question about the sardines: I don’t know because we didn’t order them. The salad I ordered is no longer on the menu. But everything we ordered there was of good quality. Thanks for reporting back, mediocre meals included! So near Arthur Avenue when you were in Fordham. Sorry for the bad meal! Thanks for your trip report.

I would like to stay in an area that is close to Christmas decorations and a hotel that is decorated nicely. Would like to stay under $400 a night. What is your desired bedding configuration? I adult; 2 teens. So would like at least 2 beds. Hi Karyn - you\\'re still casting pretty wide net - as you\\'d be hard pressed to find a hotel in NYC that is not close to Christmas decorations.\\nIf I assume you want to be close to / see the most touristy things (e.g., Rockefeller Center tree and ice rink, decorated windows on 5th Ave., Bryant Park rink and Christmas market...), then I\\'d consider looking in midtown.\\nAdding to that, I always prefer smaller boutique hotels - and I\\'m a Marriott guy - so a quick search shows the Lexington Hotel with rooms from 12/17 - 12/20 - well within your budget (random dates I put in).\\nThat said - I personally would stay further from mid-town and I\\'d expand beyond the typical touristy things. If you do a quick Google search of \"things to do nyc Christmas\" you\\'ll immediately see several articles on fun things to do in NYC around Christmas.\\nFinal note >> Since the decorations seem to be high on your priority list - consider getting a reservation at Rolf\\'s German restaurant. Their food is OK - but their Christmas decorations are crazy over the top.\\nGood luck in your planning - and have fun. The best place to stay in NYC during Christmas(and pretty much year round) is somewhere that meets your budget and travel dates.\\nThere is no 1 location in NYC where decorations/activities take place. Also, if visiting NYC, you should explore the various parts of the city...especially during any of the major holidays.\\nThere are entire neighborhoods in the city that get decked out with Christmas decorations. Some are outside of Manhattan. There is the buzz of the Rockefeller Center area with the tree, Radio city and Saks\\' window display.\\nThen there are pockets all throughout the city where you will feel the excitement of people doing last minute shopping, holiday markets(hopefully) in full swing and restaurants(hopefully) welcoming everyone in.\\nI would focus on picking a hotel and realizing that you can get around to see just about anything you want to see. Agree with ter and Ray. Also, hotel prices fluctuate dramatically by date so saying $400/night doesn\\'t tell us enough. The beginning of Dec. is typically most expensive. The most affordable dates of the month are usually ~18-27 Dec. The Lotte Palace is very near Rockefeller. Center, has big rooms and some awesome views. Their decorations are usually wonderful. Less expensive, the Warwick is near Radio City. Hi guys, super last minute but we\\'ve been let down by our night-time venue for our upcoming wedding in NYC and need an alternative, what we\\'re looking for follows, any help would be greatly appreciated! We have our restaurant for the daytime meal but now looking for a bar for the night.\\n20person group\\nFrom 8pm\\nDrinks and bar food\\nDo not require a private room, just a table/tables.\\nLively atmosphere without being too rowdy.\\nManhattan\\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated. When is this taking place? Sorry, Thursday early June. Check out the garden at The Crooked Knife. Is there still a Quarantine Requirement for International Travellers visiting New York? #4 - Apparently not https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory\\nBut the Federal CDC prohibition of most incoming UK & EU travel is still in place https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html\\nSo I suppose it may depend on what last minute means or some other unknown factors? OP says \"early June\" Ahh\\nSo hopefully, if it\\'s a destination wedding, things will have changed If it\\'s open, take a look at WHITE HORSE TAVERN (Greenwich Village) or WHITE HORSE TAVERN and BAR (Downtown/Financial District).\\nDelicious food, great crowd and a large range of cocktails, beers and wine. We enjoyed a Friday night cocktail hour there and didn\\'t want to leave, but had dinner reservations. We had a great time!\\nGreenwich Village http://www.whitehorsetavern1880.com/\\nFinancial District https://www.whitehorsetavernny.com/menu/ Thanks all, our travel restrictions are set to change this month according to the Gov. and all reports point to the US doing the same to align so our fingers are crossed but we’re aware it might not happen.\\nI will check out all your recommendations, thanks again. Hi. I am planning a visit to New York in 2022 for a special birthday and would love to see Billy Joel in concert at the same time. Am I correct in thinking that he performs often at Maddison Square Gardens and if so has anyone been and can share their experience and advice.\\nThanks in advance. Like once a month if he is not touring somewhere else.\\nhttps://www.billyjoel.com/ Just announced today that Billy Joel will be performing October 24 at the Formula1 race in Austin TX. They always have big names there for the moneyed crowd. Yup, before the pandemic while it was still possible he performed once a month in the Garden. By al means, attend one of his concerts if they are resumed when you\\'re in town. He\\'s an excellent performer with a huge backlog of music to choose from. I\\'ve seen him live and I highly enjoyed it (I\\'m a fan of his muisc). My friend, who haden\\'t listened to him all that much enjoyed herself too. Not a Joel fan per se but went to Garden in Feb 2019 and it was brilliant. One tip i got that helped is that it is fine to sit behind stage - and cheaper!- as his stage set up allows 360 degree views. No obstructed view He has these dates for Madison Square Garden on his schedule:\\nDecember 20\\nJanuary 14\\nFebruary 12\\nMarch 24\\nApril 8\\nEdited: 8:54 am, May 01, 2021 Not sure of this helps - below is a link to the Billy Joel tribute band called \\'\\'TURNSTILES\\'\\'. We also wanted to see Billy Joel live in concert at MSG... but somehow our NY visit dates did not work out. We were based out of Dallas at the time - and ended up watching this concert by this tribute band.\\nhttps://www.turnstilestributeband.com/\\nNeedless to say - the concert was excellent - the venue was open air - next to a lake in mid Oct - excellent weather as well.\\nJust my 2 cents - you can check out the dates of this band as well....\\nEdited: 12:08 pm, May 01, 2021 I have been a few times to see Billy at the Gardens and its amazing, I live in Scotland. I always buy my tickets off stubhub and sitting at the side of the stage looking onto the stage just roughly around where Billy\\'s piano sits (it revolves same as what he does at other giogs). You can sit behind the stage as well but I haven\\'t tried those seats or could always take chances with seats up in the boonies and hope one of Billy\\'s people sees you and gives you front row tickets :)\\nI am also heading back next year and timing our trip in the summer as been a while since did a summer visit (June time I think) to coincide with seeing Billy. He is a brilliant performer and everytime have seen him he is just brilliant, something special about seeing him in NYC. I would love if he played Carnegie Hall but will make do with the gardens in teh meantime ;)\\nGo for it, treat yourself. I\\'ve seen Billy at the Garden 4 or 5 times. I\\'ve sat in several different locations, but directly behind the stage is perfectly fine.\\nIt\\'s a 2 1/2 hour singalong. I’m not sure if Ticketmaster or Madison Square Garden is to blame, but after months of postponements due to Covid and unable to get a refund, when concerts outside of NYC were cancelled with a full refund. I’ll pass on Billy Joel or anything in the future at MSG.\\nEdited: 1:55 pm, May 01, 2021 Just a tip for anyone taking info from this post, the link to MSG on Tripadvisor is not the official site, it\\'s a third party ticket seller. https://ny.eater.com/2021/2/17/22266913/where-to-find-nyc-best-pastrami\\nThe number 1 may surprise you, it surprised me. And it \"barely beats\" number 2 which is an NYC institution.\\nI\\'ve tried a few on the list but now have a few more added! Thank you for the great link! I am in my early 40\\'s, born & raised in NYC, and Jewish. And at one time, a deli owner (not kosher). I\\'ve never tried pastrami! It never appealed to me. I\\'ve had plenty of opportunities to try it from Ben\\'s, Mill Basin Deli, and others. I will keep this list close. One day I will try it.\\nEdited: 5:03 pm, February 17, 2021 You\\'ve never tried pastrami? Sacrilege!\\nAnd obviously it\\'s just one person\\'s ranked list but I must admit they all look good. Thin style, thick style, they\\'ve all got their own textures and flavours.\\nI was surprised that Junior\\'s is on there. On this forum they\\'re famous for cheesecake. As I said, it never appealed to me. After my professional deli experiences, cold cuts no longer appeal to me. I actually had a corned beef sandwich at Junior\\'s almost 20 years ago. It was delicious! A few points/corrections...\\nHarry and Ida\\'s closed before the pandemic, not during. Their flagship Duck\\'s Eatery closed during the pandemic.\\nTo continue the story, the Romanians called it \"Pastrama\" and it was/is essentially any cured/smoked meat\\nI think I prefer Katz\\'s over #1 Hometown. Hometown was good but very salty on the first few bites.\\nI miss the comments on Eater, but I understand why they took them down Ah well, the times they are a changin\\', and so are our eating habits (and preferences). We haven\\'t had a truly GREAT pastrami sandwich since the Carnegie Deli closed.\\nCH\\nEdited: 6:11 pm, February 17, 2021 Ah Harry and Ida\\'s, such a shame.\\nThe picture of Hometown\\'s looks so good to me. As does David\\'s Brisket House.\\nI planned to go to Frankel\\'s when I was staying in Williamsburg one year but ran out of time. Sometimes I think it would be more useful, esp to guests, if they did lists of places to avoid for certain types of food. It\\'s nice to have top 10 lists, and sometimes one discovers something new, but there are generally a number of more or less equally good places at or near the top (with one\\'s choice often having more to do with personal preferences than absolute \"goodness\") and a lot of truly undistinguished, awful and/or poisonous choices near the bottom. Too bad Eater or someone else can\\'t put together \"here\\'s what to look for and what to avoid\" type lists.\\nI was thinking about this the other day when people were describing favorite coffee places. A couple years ago I was out at Yellowstone park. We stopped mid-afternoon at one of those park stores that also had a cafe. I wanted a coffee and asked the young woman behind the counter when the coffee was made. \"Fresh this morning!\" she chirped. Well fresh this morning may work for a cupcake, or pastrami, but for me at least it doesn\\'t work for coffee. Giving someone a list of questions to ask when buying pastrami could be useful, especially when visiting a \"top ten\" spot isn\\'t an option. I think with visitors, most don\\'t want to do any research, they\\'re quite happy to ask on this forum for \"the best xxx\" and are happy for whatever answers are given and to be guided in that way. From then on, it\\'s up to them if they want to research and look and ask questions deeper.\\nI think Eater and other publications focus on the positive, here\\'s a list of things we like. Listing negatives and what to avoid might not be good media. I am aware that biking is not the best way to see the sights. That said....\\nThere are a few things I\\'d like to see closer on our ride. Are there places to lock your bike and venture in a bit? We will stay in the southern part. Bike only half or even quarter of the park depending on time.\\nTIA all! If you have a nice bike, do not leave it unattended. Locking it to a rack means nothing. I once locked a bike to a sign post outside of a doorman building not far from the Park as I was making a quick visit to someone I knew in the building. Came down 20 minutes later and the bike was gone.\\nIf you want to use a bike, Citibike. Your question was really vague. I agree. Use Citibike. Here is the Central Park bike map. You will be walking your bike to anything off the main loops that you want to see. Your post is totally unspecific.\\nhttps://assets.centralparknyc.org/pdfs/maps/Central_Park_Bike_Map.pdf\\nHere\\'s the Central Park website www.centralparknyc.org It is difficult to really see central park on bike. The people biking in central park are mainly there because they want to bike and they are not exploring the interior locations of central park. Most of the interesting stuff is in the interior of the park where bikes can\\'t go. I would explore the interior of central park on foot and then if you still want to bike get a bike at that point. I would not be parking a bike on the street in public. There are plenty of citibike locations around the perimeter of the park that you can use if you want to go for a ride. I don\\'t know how good those citibikes are with hills (have seen people having to get off them to walk their bikes up the more intense hills) so you may not want to bike north of the 97th street traverse because the northern part of the loop in central park has some significant hills. The rest of the loop isn\\'t that difficult with only smaller hills here or there I\\'d be happy to bike Central Park on the main roads in there and just walk the bike on the smaller paths. It\\'s all part of the experience. But don\\'t just drop your bike and explore for a while, take it with you as you walk. Or use one of the bike parking areas.\\nLook at the map linked in post # 2 and work out a route. The bike parking areas are marked with a P. I didn’t think your question was vague at all! The map linked to in #2 shows where you can park your bike (please do use racks rather than random tree/fences/posts whatever). Re: security, my husband has a nice road bike and he would *maybe* lock it to a rack in the park (with his good kryptonite lock) for 30 minutes or so, but would worry about it the whole time. He’d feel ok locking his cheap hybrid.\\nCitibike is a great idea - it eliminates all your security worries. I use it all the time and am a big fan. Be aware that the bikes are heavy and clunky, so not great on hills (unless you pop for an ebike). Also, all the docks are on the perimeter of the park, not actually in it, so you’ll have a bit of walking to and from destinations in the park’s interior. (You can get a map of docks through the Citibike app, which is super-handy to have on your phone in general.) Do you want a helmet?\\nCitibike doesn\\'t give you that option, the rental places at the southern end of the park do. Bike parking as noted by the map in post 2. There aren’t a ton of bike racks, but they are smartly situated near the things you want to walk to see. Note that bikes are NOT allowed to be locked to anything other than the bike racks— occasionally the parks department does crack down on this, and will come through and confiscate bikes attached to fencing or sign posts. If you use designated racks though you should be fine. Also, I see lots of groups where one person will stand and watch the bikes while the others walk a little ways for the sight see/photo op. This is a good back up in case the bike racks are full.\\nFor your specific scenario I would not recommend Citibike personally. I love CitiBike but I don’t think it’s practical for what you’re looking for. They don’t come with locks and it would be a big liability to lock them up (if someone else takes yours you could be on the hook for the lost bike cost), and with the placement of citibike docks and direction of the roads in the park, it’s much more hassle than it is worth to leave the park to dock the bike to see what you want to see and then leave the park to pick a bike back up to see the next thing, and as they’re quite cumbersome, they’re not the best to walk. Nothing wrong with a normal bike rental (which will come with a lock and as noted above, a helmet), and locking it to a rack or walking it occasionally. There is a bike rack at the Boat house from which you can explore the Southern part of the Park and visit many of the Park’s best known sites. Perhaps we can all contribute to this for future visitors. Honestly, all 5 boroughs have delicious things, but I know Manhattan mainly.\\nRalph’s ices-several locations. Walk up stands. Many flavors. Note creme ices, which are not as commonly found as typical water ices. They sell those, too. All the chip flavors- vanilla, chocolate, mint, Java - have shards of chocolate.\\nRoasted vegetables - Little Beet, several locations. Service is Chipotle style and there are bases and proteins, but you can get charred sweet potatoes, broccoli as sides or mains.\\nHard pretzels at Greenmarkets - various locations/days. I broke a tooth on one so I skip these. But they are good. Note: large soft pretzels are better in Philadelphia.\\nChocolate babka is a cake, typically sliced. It is rich and heavily laced with chocolate. There is also a cinnamon variety, but I have never tried it. Anyway, Trader Joe, various locations, has the best-and cheapest. Many speak of the version at Breads, but that is Nutella flavored, which I do not care for.\\nRound cookies, half chocolate iced, half vanilla iced. These range from three-bite size to much larger. Often the cookie is cake-like rather than hard. Trader Joe offers these too called Half Moon Cookies, but the cookies can be found in many locations.\\nI am sure others can add pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, dumplings, bubble tea, coffee, ramen, pho, other soups, pierogi, pancakes, cupcakes, salad, cheesecake, ice cream, cannoli, bread, doughnuts, chocolate chip cookies, etc. thank you. I always thought babka was bread not cake. 🤷\\u200d♂️\\nWhen in NYC I like to eat things I cannot get st home.\\nI love corned beef sandwiches at Sarge’s. Babka is bread, it contains yeast. And the cookies are called black and whites, and are cake-like. Hard or crunchy cookies dipped in icing to look like the real thing are blasphemous. The Ralph\\'s Ices are from Staten Island - a local mom and pop business expanded into the big city. Originally babka was made from stale challah bread although most bakers now make their own dough. Challah and Babka, Oy Vey! Both sweet breads IMO but a plain or raisin braided loaf was bread, the same dough with cinnamon, nuts or poppyseed and icing was coffee cake. I love Sarge’s too, pastrami on a grilled garlic hoagie!\\nEdited: 9:32 pm, May 03, 2021 I was hanging out in the city on Saturday and passed by the Washington Mews when I was heading out/into(I forget) the park.\\nThen today, I randomly pulled up TONY and saw this article from a few days ago. Some nice homes in/along these streets!\\n-Doyers St reminds me of the curved part of Soi Rambuttri, adjacent to the more famous Khao San Road, in Bangkok.\\n-3 of the listings are in Brooklyn not far from where I live.\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/10-amazing-hidden-streets-in-nyc-to-visit-right-now-043021 Very cool! I know the Brooklyn streets, of course, and Doyers . . . and have heard of most of the others from this forum - but the one in Washington Heights was totally new to me.\\nI would also nominate Fuller Place in the Windsor Terrace neighborhood - one block of picture-perfect small houses. Great list, and happy to say that I\\'ve been to all except for the 3 in Brooklyn. I walk through Washington Mews a LOT, and love Sylvan Terrace, a very special street. Was on Grove over the weekend (and then drinks at Bar Pisellino). Gay Street is adorable. And Doyers is where Apotheke is.\\nThey should also have included Commerce St, which is also quite special, and Cornelia, which is now an Open Street, and has so many great restaurants.\\nGrace Court in Brooklyn Heights is also very pretty.\\nEdited: 6:51 pm, May 03, 2021 None of the top Tunnel St, Yep there is a street that is a Tunnel\\nhttps://www.6sqft.com/inside-the-graffiti-covered-191st-street-tunnel-nycs-deepest-subway-and-only-underground-street/ A strange alley is Jersey St., a two-block long way between Crosby and Mulberry, south of Houston that has absolutely nothing to see. It is hard to imagine why it even exists. We\\'re just in the process of booking our first time visit to NYC for March 2022. Our flight is due to arrive in JFK at 15.40 and we have to get to our accommodation near Penn Station. How long should I \"budget\" for between landing and actually getting to our accommodation? Trying to plan the rest of the evening but not sure if we should just be writing off that first day as everything will be closed by the time we get to our base. It’s about an hour from the airport to your destination (depending on how you travel, traffic conditions, etc). It’s hard to know what immigration will look like a year from now. The airport is fairly empty now, according to a friend who flew in yesterday. But a year from now, when travel hopefully resumes, it may take longer. Also, if your plane lands at the same time as another, the lines will be longer than if your plane is the only one arriving.\\nI wouldn’t get timed tickets for anything your first night, but a late dinner is more than likely. And you can certainly explore Times Square. Thank you. I wasn\\'t going to book any tickets but just wondered if we\\'d actually find anything still open by the time we get to our destination! We\\'re more than likely going to be too tired to do much more than eat a light meal, unpack and go to bed as we\\'ll have had two long flights but I\\'m one of these people who likes to cram every minute with doing something! Like Risa, I wouldn\\'t time anything specific. So hard to predict immigration times, and if your flight is a few minutes early or (hope not ...) a bit late this could mean you\\'re landing with a bunch of other flights as well.\\nHowever, I would scout out a thing or two to see / do - at least some walking routes perhaps to get your bearings. You\\'re not far from Empire State Building and if you feel like it when you\\'re settled in that is something you could do. Wouldn\\'t book a timed ticket for day of arrival though - you may be too tired. Or it might be a bad weather day with lots of clouds.\\nAnd also perhaps have looked at some restaurants where you might want to have dinner on your first evening The immidiate area around Penn Station isn\\'t the greatest when it comes to restaurants, in my not so humble opinion anyhow, but you\\'ll find quite a few more if you take Risa\\'s advice and explore Times Square some on your first evening. Because then you could head a few blocks west to Hells Kitchen where there are better options as far as restaurants go.\\nDepending on exactly where you\\'re hotel is, Mercato (Italian) or Skylight Diner (well, typical diner fare) might be two options for places to eat nearish to Penn Station.\\nEdited: 2:42 pm, May 02, 2021 Thank you. We only eat kosher food so our options are quite a bit more limited but we\\'ve found a few within walking distance and yes Times Square was basically the one thing we were going to do that first evening if only to pick up some brochures and maps from the tourist office. NYC is not the most difficult city to find kosher food at least. Heh There is no shortage of kosher restaurants in NYC. Not far from Times Square is Le Marais, but you shouldn’t go there your first night, it’s too expensive to be tired when there. https://www.lemarais.net/\\nYou will have no problem finding kosher restaurants at all price points.\\nThere are also many vegan restaurants, some with hashgacha. You may want to check those out too. They’re very affordable.\\nPlease note that some of the Taim restaurants (casual falafel places) have hashgacha, but at least one doesn’t.\\nThere are two kosher steakhouses downtown, Reserve Cut and Wall Street Grill. Both expensive.\\nHere’s a list of places in manhattan Brooklyn and queens. There are so many more, though,\\nIncluding quite a few pizza places.\\nhttps://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/best-kosher-restaurants-nyc NYC is not called \"the city that never sleeps\" fo nothing. Even if your plane is late there will be things to do. I would allow at least 2 to 2 and a half hours, assuming your plane\\'s arrival time doesn\\'t change and it does in fact arrive on time. Many intl flights arrive around that time, so you could also hit lines at immigration. By the time you get out of the airport it\\'s going to be rush hour, so it could be slow going. In a worst case scenario it could be 3 hours, even more.\\nPersonally, I would not plan more for arrival day than maybe dinner and a walk (possibly trip to Empire State building if as convenient to your hotel as it sounds it may be).\\nEdited: 6:05 pm, May 02, 2021 I would think your hotel has maps of Manhattan as well. Some have more brochures as well, but that does vary more. Hey-\\nOP has not revealed, and no one has asked, how many people are “we,” the quantity size and weight of luggage, their ages and physical abilities and the method that OP plans to use to get to the destination (responders assume taxi- if do, then good to know how and what to get, cost, tolls etc), and what “near Penn Station” actually means- surely that’s a factor too, after such a long fight with connection in Geneva.\\n... and Risa L#6: thanks for the link to the list- Le Marais sounds like a place for me to visit to eat for next time- that name is fond memories of the area where I stay in Paris.\\nEdited: 11:21 pm, May 02, 2021 I am flying to buffalo via jet blue, transit at JFK, arrived 330p flying to buffalo 930p. I needed a a covid test before entering canada. Any recommendation to where I can get test. From where are you flying to JFK? Internationally? If so, you will probably need a COVID test before you get to JFK, no?\\nCH CasaHoffa is correct.\\nIf you are flying into the US from abroad - the US CDC currently requires that you have a negative test within three days of your flight departure to the US - even if you are just transiting through the US.\\nIf we are making an incorrect assumption - and you are actually starting from the US - then just Google Covid test for your area - there are tons of places (e.g., pretty much any Walgreens, RiteAid, ...) Looking for advice on what to see/do in the Financial district? I have not seen this part of NYC. What are your suggestions? Start here, so much to see/do:\\nhttps://downtownny.com Wow, that’s not an easy question. Keep in mind that Manhattan was first developed from the downtown area, and was the seat of government at the start of this country. All of that becomes apparent when you visit downtown.\\nYou can walk along the waterfront, all around the tip of Manhattan, from the East River to the Hudson River, with views of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Clinton Castle, where you pick up your SoL tickets tells the story of early immigration to the US. You can visit the Museum of the American Indian when it reopens. And Federal Hall, across the street from the NY Stock Exchange, where George Washington was inaugurated. And Wall St. You can visit Trinity Church and St Paul’s which both of cemeteries where famous people like Alexander Hamilton and Robert Fulton were buried. And Stone St which is an open cobble stone street with restaurants and bars. And the Oculus and 9/11 Memorial. And the South Street Seaport and Pier 11. And the Museum of Jewish Heritage and the Skyscraper Museum. And Battery Park. And City Hall and the Woolworth Building. And the Brooklyn Bridge. And the Staten Island Ferry. And a bunch of other ferries. And the Hudson River Park. And One World Observatory.\\nThat should keep you busy for a bit. That is an amazing list Risa, it would keep anyone busy for quite a while, however, I don\\'t believe a visit to the Financial District is complete without a visit to Fearless Girl ! WoWzer Lisa thank you! You should be a tour guide! I was pondering whether or not to check out financial district as we only have 3 full days in June. After reading your list definitely the Financial District will be a day. NYC so much to do so little time...... I❤️NYC Good call on visiting the Financial District. Very interesting area, lots of history.\\nThere are some ideas in some of the self-guided tours that you can find here, if you need any input more than what Risa gave you.\\nhttps://freetoursbyfoot.com/new-york-tours/tour-calendar/#tours\\nEdited: 11:23 am, May 02, 2021 In addition to the link in #5, here are more self guided walking tours, this site has been around for a long time and has some great options:\\nhttps://www.walkingoffthebigapple.com/p/recommended-walks.html Fearless Girl is across the street looking up at the Stock Exchange...hard to miss, just look for all of the people standing with their arms at their waist in warrior stance, taking photos with her. Charging Bull at on a little plaza at the south end of Broadway. And while walking on Broadway, note the plaques embedded in the sidewalk. They represent all of the people or events for which a Ticker Tape Parade was held. (Ticker tape was the paper thrown from stock trades, came from the Stock Exchange, no longer used, now it\\'s confetti, but that\\'s frowned upon for waste reasons) The Seaglass Carousel in Battery Park opened yesterday with May hours from 11 to 9. It’s best in the evening when the lights in the fish are on.\\nhttps://www.seaglasscarousel.nyc/\\nThere is a somewhat hidden casual restaurant called The View nearby that has reopened for outdoor dining and the view is great especially in the early evening. We had many pleasant dinners there last year and are looking forward to more this summer.\\nWednesdays & Thursday: 4;00 PM to 10:00 PM\\nFriday: 4:00 PM to 11:00 PM\\nSaturday Brunch & Dinner: 11:30 AM to 11:00 PM\\nSunday Brunch & Dinner: 12:0on to 8:00 PM\\nhttps://masterpiececaterers.com/menus/\\nMenus on the website are also somewhat hidden :-)\\nhttps://masterpiececaterers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-View-at-Battery-Park-Menu-Dinner.pdf Not to mention the National Museum of the American Indian at 1 Bowling Green.\\nThat\\'s one of the original Alexander Hamilton US Custom\\'s House, one of of the most attractive old buildings in Manhattan. It\\'s free to enter as it\\'s a Smithsonian museum, but I think it\\'s closed temporarily. By the time of your visit it could be open.\\nEven if you\\'re not interested in American Indian culture, the interior of the building is a sight to see.\\nhttps://americanindian.si.edu/main/visit/newyork/ Thanks for recommending The View, BatteryParkNYC - I’m friends w the owner. He’s such a wonderful man. We are planning to spend one day in NYC on our summer road trip through the north east. As of now I have a hotel booked in Jersey City, we\\'ll arrive late Friday night, take the bus into the city Saturday morning to spend the day and on Sunday morning head to Mystic, CT. Should we keep the reservations in Jersey City or would it be better to find a hotel on the east side of the city? IMO depends somewhat on your planned arrival / departure times and driver comfort\\nA Sunday morning departure should be relatively light traffic\\nA Friday night arrival might be more challenging especially if headed to a hotel in Manhattan or Queens - but maybe OK after certain hours (Friday summer weekend house traffic)\\nLook at hotels in Long Island City Queens which has good subway access (you\\'ll likely have to park in a separate garage) Thank you! I\\'m thinking we will probably arrive between 11p and 12a on a Friday in the summer and we will leave around 8am or 9am Sunday morning. I have drove in the city several times, so that is not a concern. I will look to see what else is available! You don\\'t save much by staying east and the only logical spot east of Manhattan is Long Island City where most hotels don\\'t have parking (although there are independent parking lots and garages). .most if not all of the hotels in Jersey City have parking although you will pay for it. Many of the hotels there are near a PATH train which is usually faster than a bus. Some are also near a ferry which is a fun way to travel. Which hotel did you pick?\\nThe obvious question is why not stay in Manhattan? For a 1 day stay, it\\'s so much nicer to wake up where you want to be. Sunday morning traffic in Manhattan will be lighter than in Jersey City, I think.\\nThe driving route Google maps gives from Jersey City has you avoiding Manhattan altogether and crossing east over the George Washington bridge and then the Cross Bronx Expressway (a terrible road). If you stay in NYC, you avoid that Expressway and also have the option of taking a route other than I 95 which is a busy road always clogged with traffic. There\\'s no point in getting a hotel east of Manhattan. As someone who regularly drives between NYC and New England, I think the best location for you to stay and be well positioned to leave Sunday morning would be to stay on the Upper West Side. I\\'ve also made the drive a few times between Ohio and NY. Driving in late at night should not add much more time to your drive than staying in Jersey City. Just stay on I-80 and come across the GW and head down the west side.\\nOn Sunday morning, if you leave by 9 there won\\'t be much traffic. Head up the west side and take the GW (I-95 North) to New England. Right after you cross the Harlem River, you have a choice. You can stay on I-95 and proceed to Mystic. Or you can bear off to the right and get on the Major Deegan (I-87 North) and head up to the Cross County to the Hutch to the Merritt Parkway. The latter is a much nicer and scenic drive. At Milford you will want to reconnect to I-95. Depending on how much time you have, get off at East Haven and have lunch at the Lobster Shack. They make one of the best CT style lobster rolls you will find. If you want pizza, you can go to Zuppardi\\'s which makes what I think is the best clam apizza (not a typo - its called apizza) in West Haven. From Queens (or by exiting Manhattan via one of the East River crossings) you can take the Whitestone bridge into the Bronx where you have a choice of taking the (passenger car only) Parkway Rt 15 or getting on I-95 https://goo.gl/maps/o6ZQ5NhqynQnZkWt8 @nywhiz We currently have reservations at the Holiday Inn Express Jersey City North/Hoboken, which offers free parking. I am reading some mixed reviews and having second thoughts. We considered staying in Manhattan but I was worried that it would be too much of a hassle for 1 day and too expensive. Any recommendations that I could consider? @SloppyEats Thank you for the recommendations, I will definitely save those!! There are defiantly plenty of hotels along I-95 between NYC and Mystic #6 - That hotel on Tonnelle is in an unattractive inconvenient location for getting into Manhattan https://goo.gl/maps/epMTzHFEfc45Np876\\nLocations convenient to the PATH train are much more convenient/desirable https://www.panynj.gov/path/en/schedules-maps.html\\nFor hotel suggestions specify travel dates, room/bed configuration needed and budget Forget Jersey City and commuting. In my opinion, Jersey City can be worse than Manhattan for driving/congestion.\\nDrive into the city, get a hotel and use a parking garage close to the hotel. You\\'ll wake up the next morning and be in the city. Go and enjoy yourself for the day, be in the city, then leave the next morning.\\nWhat route are you taking? If you\\'re coming from Ohio and taking I80 in, easy to enter the city through the GWB or Lincoln and choose a hotel on the west side. Easy for leaving as well. https://www.macys.com/s/flower-show/\\nAlways a nice display for an indoor show. I really enjoyed this when I saw it. When I was there, they did a guided tour of the show for free every 15 minutes (assuming they haven\\'t canceller the tours due to Covid.) If they have the tours, they begin & end at the doors on the east end of the building inside, I got recommendations from this group to go to Brighton Beach for Russian restaurants. What Russian experiences can we expect there? I\\'m not interested in the beach. If it\\'s just restaurants to experience aren\\'t there Russian restaurants in Manhattan? Trying to decide if it\\'s worth our time to go all the way to Brighton Beach. This question came up recently. Try checking this thread. A number of recommendations were given. There are a number of quality Russian restaurants in Manhattan. I wouldn\\'t travel all the way to Brighton Beach just for a meal. However, if you are also interested in exploring the neighborhood in addition to the meal then it can certainly be worthwhile. Even if you aren\\'t interested in the beach the boardwalk is worth walking and is right near there. If your time in NY is very limited then I would save a trip out to Brighton Beach for a trip when you have more time, but it depends on your interests.\\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13527649-Brighton_Beach_visit-New_York_City_New_York.html#109727660\\nEdited: 4:20 pm, May 02, 2021 The restaurant Tatiana in Brighton Beach has an evening\\'s worth of entertainment with a floor show and multiple course dinner going past midnight. Or at least that\\'s what I experienced the time I went, quite a while ago. I don\\'t know if there\\'s anything like that in Manhattan. I recently returned from an amazing trip to New York City. The purpose of my trip was to visit my daughter, who lives in Brooklyn. I usually travel around this time to visit her every year, but because I had to cancel my plans last year, it had been way too long since I had been there!\\nI had been perusing these forums trying to get ideas, and figure out what things were like, but not too many people have been traveling. So here is a quick overview of my time in New York City and Brooklyn. I flew on the exact same ticket I was going to use last year, from O\\'Hare to LaGuardia via American Airlines. Because my flight was canceled last year, it was easy to use that \"credit\" for this ticket, and I was able to book it easily. As has been happening over the past year, the airlines are consolidating flights, and my original flight was changed from 8am to 9:30am, the plane I ended up on was full, but everyone was wearing a mask. The flight attendants passed out anti-bacterial wipes, and all the passengers were wearing masks. American Airlines does not provide water or snacks for flights less than 3 hours, so bring your own if you want to eat or drink on their planes. NYC lifted the quarantine restriction in early April, and we were not asked to fill out any health questionnaires or show proof of vaccination status, so I never needed the CDC card that I had brought along \"just in case:\".\\nI have flown a few times out of O\\'Hare this past year, and that airport is a well oiled machine as far as crowd control and keeping passengers moving. LaGuardia was the same way. I did not encounter any crowds that made me feel uneasy, and there were plenty of security personnel around enforcing the mask rules. People were pretty good about leaving an arm\\'s length between each other, and the airports were not overly crowded.\\nUpon arriving in Terminal B of LGA, I headed towards the Metrocard terminals and the Q-70 bus stop which would take me to the subway. Citimapper had told me it was a 16 minute walk, and they were right! If you have any mobility issues at all, and you are flying in on American, be prepared for a hike! The new terminal is going to be beautiful, but it is not done yet, so expect some construction walls and detours along the way.\\nI did not check any baggage, so went directly to the bus stop. It is easy to follow the directions through the airport to the ground transportation, and there is even a sign directing you to the Metrocard machines, which is much more helpful than in the past. The machines are easy to use. It costs $33 for an unlimited one week pass, plus an extra $1.00 for a Metrocard if you don\\'t currently have one to reload.\\nBy now, it was around 12:50 pm on a Thursday afternoon. I used my Metrocard to get a bus ticket, and once the bus pulled up, there were plenty of seats for everyone waiting, so no one had to stand. There is also a luggage rack if you have larger suitcases. The bus drops you off at the Roosevelt Subway station, which was the one I needed for the F Train. I was also surprised by how few people were in the Subway station. The train pulled up, and i rode it to 14th St., and walked to the L Train, which took me to my daughter\\'s stop in Brooklyn. The entire trip took about 75 minutes, which was not bad at all, and there were plenty of seats in the subway cars.\\nWe decided to cook in that night, but wanted to head to Trader Joe\\'s at Union Square to pick up some last minute items and some wine for the weekend. I love the wine selection there, and you can get some excellent organic wines at a reasonable price! So, I braced myself for the rush hour crowds in the subway and along 14th Street in Manhattan... for nothing! The \"line starts here\" signs were not in use inside Trader Joe\\'s, nor in the wine store. We were able to browse without being in anyone\\'s way, and walked right up to a check out person. We walked back to the subway, and again found seats on the train. There is a cleaning crew at the start of each line, and after wiping down the seats, window sills, poles, etc, the subway cars were ready for the next set of passengers. I was amazed at how clean it was! I was not prepared for the lack of lines in the stores, but I am not complaining! It became the theme of the week...the crowds are gone from New York City! I am looking forward to this trip report as it gives another view of the city, One that Locals cant see as we are somewhat blind to daily changes\\nAlot of locals are not taking the Subway, they are either Biking or Driving, thats one reason the subways are empty I have not taken the Subway since Feb 2020 and many people I know havent taken it either.\\nThere are crowds in the city, but just not in the places you were looking, they are in the non-torusit non business parts of the City. A trip report! I\\'m really looking forward to more. Good start. Yes the residential neighborhoods continue to be packed with people. The more commercial areas don\\'t have the typical influx of people. Great to see a trip report. We missed out on our annual visit to New York last Year. Hope for better things this autumn. Looking forward to reading more! It’s always interesting to see the city through a visitor’s eyes, but even more so now. So happy to read a trip report, looking forward to reading more and happy that you are finally seeing your daughter again. I walked past that same Trader Joes about 3 weeks ago on a Sat afternoon and there was a line around the corner to get in. You lucked out there.\\nEdited: 8:52 am, April 27, 2021 Yes, I did notice a lot of people on bicycles, and there was plenty of car traffic in my daughter\\'s neighborhood in Brooklyn, however the \"tourist\" areas: Brooklyn Bridge Park, Midtown outside of Penn Station/Madison Square Garden, Met Museum and Central Park had no crowds at all. We never had trouble finding a table in a restaurant or in their outdoor seating area. The longest line we waited in was at the Bagel Store on Dekalb Ave. on Saturday morning. I loved seeing everyone out walking their dogs! It was raining that evening, so that probably kept a lot of people away. You can tell they are limiting the number of people in businesses, but we must have gotten very lucky! Does anyone have an email please for the restaurant in Times Square just to enquire about NYE thanks in advance They have a e-club which you can join: https://www.bubbagump.com/event/mama-says-get-connected/\\nThey also have a form for private events that may be helpful: https://www.bubbagump.com/location/bubba-gump-new-york-ny/ Best hotel in time square. Prices for Hotels are so reasonable compared to years ago.\\nThank you Marriot Marquis with a room that overlooks Times Square Define best. Define Times (note spelling) Square( many hotel names include Times Square that are not really near the heart of Times Square). Why Times Square? Many people think that it is the heart of the city but the city is so spread out due to it )being on a long shaped island that there is no one heart of the city. Also attractions are spread out. Many don\\'t like to stay in Times Square as it is an extremely busy place to stay so getting into & out of the area & getting a good night\\'s sleep can be problematical.\\nWe can also give you better recommendations if you give us your exact dates of travel as hotel rates vary daily, your budget including 15% tax & desired bedding configuration. I would choose either the Sanctuary or the Knickerbocker, these get good reviews, but it depends on our budget and likes. Is Times Square an absolute must? Just asking because there are so many great neighborhoods to choose from. I’ve been to New York several times, but my husband has not. The first time he went, he did not stay in Time Square.\\nI’ve stayed in many lovely neighborhoods, but Time Square is a great place if you have not stayed there before. Rates are so reasonable so we are staying at the Marriott Marquis. Thanks Good for you Realitylady. Have fun.\\nCouple of replies seem weird.\\nYou asked for best hotel in Times Square, why some would say there are better places and that “many” don\\'t like to stay there -but not give an alternative ..Why do that?\\nEdited: 9:22 pm, May 01, 2021 For myself, I gave no alternative as thw OP did not mention an alternative & many people seem to be under the misapprehwnsion that Times Square is \"the heart of the city\" when there are many other areas in Manhattan which could be more suitable. However, it seems that the OP does have a working knowledge of the city so I withdraw my recommendation. There is a rapid PCR test offered at JFK that has results in about 2hrs, even less. It is very expensive but I am not criticizing because they are offering a very needed service, especially when you go to a country that wants a PCR test 72hrs or less before arrival. That said, is there a similar, yet cheaper option, in the airport area (another terminal, public transport), that can be used with result in a guaranteed, say 4hrs tops or less? Has someone used the airport service (Adams) lately? What were you charged? Thank You. https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60763-i5-k13367212-Covid_19_PCR_test_with_fast_results_for_traveling-New_York_City_New_York.html#replies\\nA couple of the replies in this thread mention the Adams service at JFK. I think they are among the more recent ones -- like maybe post 200 and higher. Thats who I was refering to. They are quite expensive, again they are providing a needed service, but wondering if there is an alternative. Last night on the news they mentioned testing at Terminal 5 (Jet Blue) at JFK.\\nhttps://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/pressrelease/nyc-test-trace-corps-launches-rapid-covid-19-testing-at-jfk-airports-terminal-5/ Hopefully, the testing will not be required after a certain point which makes the current facility at the airport a sort of pop up business. The lab instrumentation can be expensive with the more highly automated models being the most costly. The persons who do the tests (\"clinical laboratory technologists\") must be licensed by the State of NY and this requires at least a BS in specific majors. This began in 2006 (I got the early license of #286.) So, there is a considerable start up cost that has to be recouped in test prices. We used XpresCheck at JFK: https://www.xprescheck.com\\nIt is equally as expensive as Adams ($200 for Rapid Molecular Test).\\nIf you aren\\'t in a big rush, I highly recommend Urgent Care of NY (with an appointment):\\nhttps://urgentcareofny.com/covid19/ Does anyone know when you get the results....is the address of the facility on there??? Depending upon where you are there are NYS free PCR tests available at certain sites. Although they don’t guarantee a turnaround time if your backup is the quick test at JFK it may be worthwhile. Worst case is the results don’t come back in time and you then get the rapid test. We got tests at a LabQ mobile site at Water and Wall last month and I got the results the next morning; my husband got his a few hours after mine. I hadn’t noticed the van there lately but it’s shown on their web site so maybe it’s back. They move them around from time to time. There was no charge.\\nhttps://labq.com/covid-mobile-testing/\\nWe needed PCR-RT tests for travel and they “assured” me it was the same as PCR (anything in writing there only mentioned PCR without the RT) so I was concerned but the written test results we got said PCR-RT. We are looking at September of this year. My main concern is being in a good area that\\'s not deserted at night, close to the subway and hopefully some good places to eat nearby. This is what we\\'ve came up with.\\nArlo Nomad\\nDouble Tree Hilton Metropolitan\\nWashington Square Hotel\\nMoxy East Village\\nWhat does everyone thing about these places? Thanks in advance! So many helpful people on here! My top two picks would be Washington Square hotel and Moxy East Village.\\nGreat location for areas to spend time in - great vibes! Lots and lots of restaurants in those too.\\nThe hotels are both near subway stations, which makes it easy to get around. They seem very, very different in style though so I think I would pick the one that best fits your taste if prices are similar. Look at pictures and read reviews. I haven\\'t stayed at either, but both are in areas where I make a point to spend some time whenever I visit. The rooms at the Moxy seems to be a bit quirky, and newer. \\'hip boutique-y\\' if there is such a thing. From the pictures, it seems like the shower area isn\\'t all that private, but since I haven\\'t stayed I can\\'t say for sure. Location wise, they\\'re wonderful though. I think I would pick the Arlo or the Moxy. I like the location of these for a vibrant neighbourhood feel with lots of places to eat nearby.\\nAnd I prefer the more modern style of hotel so these are my first choice, but check room sizes carefully because the Arlo has very small rooms, and I think the Moxy may do too.\\nThe WSH may come a close second for the location only for me, it\\'s a great location in a very quaint neighbourhood, but the hotel style itself does not appeal as much as the Arlo and Moxy.\\nIf only the Arlo rooms were a little bigger and the price a little lower......\\nAlso check reviews that may sway you. Washington Square or the Moxy solely based on location. The Doubletree Metropolitan has looked like it was about to reopen for 7 or 8 months but hasn\\'t so I assume they have been working on it as people have been coming and going,just not guests I guess.\\nIt has the advantage of being directly on top of a subway station (for the 6 train). There are also many buses headed south on Lexington and north on 3d Av.\\nAlthough some may consider it a pale blue eyesore, it has the distinction of being one of the first, if not the first, postwar hotels on east side and I believe was designed by Morris Lapidus, architect for some of Miami Beach\\'s best known mid-century modern hotels.\\nI have heard the rooms are small, but have never seen them.\\nMany large British Airways flight crews stayed there when it was open. My gym is across the street and I frequently encountered arriving or departing BA crews as I walked down Lexington Av.\\nI am not familiar with the other hotels so can\\'t compare. We stayed at the Arlo Nomad a few years ago and were not impressed. I wouldn’t stay there again. I am not contradicting Aynet’s view, but just giving a different perspective - we didn’t like it for the reason he/she did. It’s like it was trying too hard to be trendy and cool (in our opinion). Also, the perpetual smell in the lobby was strong and obnoxious, the room we stayed in had a see-through shower (we knew of this ahead of time & so not blaming the hotel, just wasn’t as convenient to work around as we had envisioned), and we didn’t love the location. I don’t think it was awful, but NOT our style at all! Definitely consider your preference in hotel type, as we found it made a difference & we will do with a lower key, less “hip” place next time. My top pick from these 4 is Moxy. Strikes the best balance between location and design.\\nEdited: 11:57 pm, April 26, 2021 Doubletree or Moxy. If you go with Doubletree they have great chocolate chip cookies. I have stayed at a lot of hiltons but only stayed at a few doubletrees. It always throws me off when they give me cookies upon checkin. Heh. Amy...I\\'m worried about the same thing with Arlo. My wife wants to stay there for the view, but that isn\\'t important to me. I just want a good area that we feel safe walking back to at night. I\\'m open to suggestions as well if anyone has any hotels to add?? Thank you everyone! Scratch everything I said above . . . We stayed at the Arlo SoHo, NOT Nomad (I looked up the location and realized my mistake). It was right next to a major road (maybe the George Washington, but I could be wrong about that too, haha) and it was very loud and just too busy for our taste. It did not feel in any way dangerous, but I didn\\'t love the location and I wasn\\'t crazy about the hotel, either. I am sure the hotels are similar, but the location was different and I can\\'t give feedback on the Nomad, since that is NOT where we stayed. Sorry for the confusion!! It has just been voted that the Open Streets program, started a year ago at the start of the pandemic, will become permanent and expanded with increased funding.\\nAs part of the program is Open Restaurants, and how this will work from July 1st I\\'m not sure.\\nI like it from a visitor and leisure perspective, but I do understand the logistics for vehicles and businesses.\\nhttps://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/04/29/new-york-city-open-streets-program/\\nMore information from DOT: https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openstreets.shtml There are 60 miles of open streets, there is a map coming soon, but this is a list so far:\\nhttps://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openstreets.shtml#map And extra information about Open Restaurants from Grub Street (written in March):\\nhttps://www.grubstreet.com/2021/03/how-does-nyc-open-streets-work.html These are not all places with restaurants, some are residential streets (I recognized some of the areas) Of course it\\'s not all restaurants. Residential streets would benefit from open streets too. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff removed this post at the original author\\'s request.\\nTo review the Tripadvisor Forums Posting Guidelines, please follow this link: http://www.tripadvisor.com/pages/forums_posting_guidelines.html\\nWe remove posts that do not follow our posting guidelines, and we reserve the right to remove any post for any reason.\\nRemoved on: 9:24 pm, April 30, 2021\\nEdited: 9:24 pm, April 30, 2021 I have to say that open streets is one of the best programs for Manhattan.\\nWe had something similar prior to Covid. It was called play streets.\\nIn residential neighborhoods; open streets have seen communities get involved. It feels great to be a part of contributing to the neighborhood. This program seems to bring local/non local people together.\\nIn my area the street was closed from Friday to Sunday evening. Volunteers helped set up the street with the chairs and tables. There where buckets of calk for the kids to draw on the street, movie night, board games, raffles and chess tables etc.\\nLast year - http://uptowngrandcentral.org/open-streets\\nAll the local restaurants where allowed to use the open street for their patrons. We had \"open restaurant programs\" where you could buy a ticket and try items in every restaurant that participated in our neighboughood. We had crowds of visitors during this period. All respecting the safety rules i.e masks, social distancing etc.\\nIf you have open streets in your neighboughood; you might want to consider donating your time or other. Help set up, take down, donate plants, games etc. A little goes a long way. It\\'s pretty much just for the benefit of restaurants in my Boston neighborhood but it\\'s a real burden for a lot of residents and business\\' that aren\\'t restaurants.\\nIt\\'s made parking nearly impossible and from what I gather really hard on the elderly who depended on a car to get groceries do a quick drop off then look for parking. Several older people have told me they will move if it\\'s permanent and one noted the irony of how difficult or expensive that will be without the ability to stop a moving truck within a block or so of their apartment.\\nA non-restaurant business owner I know said it has caused a lot of problems with his inventory deliveries. They are not so popular here in Queens.\\nI think it depends on the area, Areas they rely more on walking like it, but areas they rely more on cars do not I like your thinking, nycforever. I agree with you.\\nI also see where residents could be inconvenienced with their vehicles and business requirements (deliveries).\\nI guess somewhere like Manhattan would be more suited to it than a car centric outer borough. I wonder if Council thought of just continuing with it in Manhattan and forgoing the outer boroughs. Though the article I linked said that two dozen Jackson Heights residents rallied in support of the program, so it goes to show that there must be sections of the outer boroughs that really like it. I like it too, but I have no reason not to. Open Streets are extremely popular around my neighborhood. (Which is not to say they’re universally popular - there are of course some people who gripe.)\\nI love them, myself: the way they transform blocks is almost magical. Starting next Mon, May 3 bar seating/service will be allowed again at NYC bars and restaurants. This will be a game changer for smaller places that really need bar seating to even reach their 50% capacity. I would assume it will still be spread out. I did not catch the specific guidelines on that, but my guess is you still need to be 6 ft apart from anyone not in your \"group\" when sitting at the bar. That could be hard to enforce, so this should be interesting. -:- Message from Tripadvisor staff -:-\\nTripadvisor staff has removed this post because it did not meet Tripadvisor\\'s forum guidelines with regards to off-topic chat.

Thank you for your response! ok thank you for pointing that out. Didn\\'t mean to step on anyone\\'s toes. Quite a while back, TA started allowing relocation type questions. Proximity to the subway is key. Look at the subway map https://new.mta.info/ and experiment with the trip planner so she can get an idea of travel times and route options to her job, etc.\\nAnother variable is if she wants (and can afford) an apartment on her own or if a roommate situation might be more suitable initially\\nParts of Queens are safe, convenient commutes to midtown / downtown and (relatively) affordable.\\nAlso try citydata.com which is a useful resource about relocating - both info and forums\\nGood luck! It really depends on your Budget and I will second Queens, its very safe here.\\nQueens is a little cheaper than Manhattan or Brooklyn Budget does come into play. Manhattan Rents now average over $3600/month, which is down from a year prior\\nhttps://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ny/manhattan/\\nThat\\'s not doable for many many people Personally for her I would look at East Village, West Village, north Brooklyn areas like Carroll Gardens, Red Hook, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, etc. Maybe ask the agency where some of her future coworkers live I live in Brooklyn and am pretty settled in here (my husband, who\\'s been here for 35+ years, even more so), but if I were just starting out, I think I\\'d look in Queens. Jackson Heights and Forest Hills both have a lot of appealing apartment buildings, and good transit links to Manhattan (Jackson Hts being closer than Forest Hills). Jackson Heights wins for food, Forest Hills for access to parks. But I don\\'t know how appealing these neighborhoods would be for someone who\\'s young, single and just starting out in the city.\\nIn Brooklyn, The southern edge of Park Slope (aka the South Slope) is somewhat more affordable than the heart of Park Slope, and therefore draws a lot of young people. So does the gentrifying neighborhood of Crown Heights (I\\'ve had friends tell me that perceptions of safety there are block by block, with stable blocks next to blocks that are pretty rundown, even dicey). For big, new, glassy high-rises, Downtown Brooklyn. For nightlife and hordes of young people, Williamsburg or Bushwick, maybe Greenpoint.\\nBut really, I think the most helpful thing would be for your daughter to spend significant time scouting the city to get a feel for different areas. Does she have a network here that she can draw on for advice and suggestions? People who know her, and whom she knows, are in a position to be more helpful than random strangers on the internet. (And the fact is, most of us are probably closer to your age than to hers!) Hello! Is anyone aware of list, or know of, restaurants that ARE NOT participating in the covid surcharge? I have looked on this forum and online but did not find an actual list of restaurants that are or are not charging the fee; although I might have missed it. Thank you in advance for any assistance. I doubt there is one consolidated list - none that I have seen. I was charged one last week - $6 on the bill - but don’t recall that I was advised beforehand. In truth, $6 seems a small price to pay, but my friend was annoyed by it. Probably easier to call ahead to some of the restaurants you plan on visiting and asking directly. Since you\\'re trying to avoid them, that would be easy enough to do within a short period of time. I have not encountered a single restaurant with this surcharge, so I don\\'t think it will be hard to avoid them. If it\\'s a big deal to you, then follow the suggestion to call. Or (my recommendation): don\\'t worry about it, eat at places that appeal to you, and if by chance you\\'re hit with a modest surcharge, chalk it up to experience. If they aren\\'t charging a \"COVID surcharge\" there\\'s a decent chance they\\'ve simply raised prices. Not aware of any list. Not every restaurant is doing a surcharge and if they are it is supposed to be listed in the app or menus. I\\'d go into any restaurant expecting increased prices, or a fee, wanting to actively avoid this surcharge, just seems that people don\\'t care about the hospitality industry and the struggles it has faced over the past 12+ months.\\nMcDonalds, Burger King, Chick-Fil-A, Oh you get the idea, they\\'ll probably not have a surcharge, as they\\'re massive organisations.\\nembrace change, be glad that the place is still open, and is trying to recoup some costs.\\nM There are way to many restaurants and no \\'registration\\' requirements so I\\'d say a complete list of those using it, or not, is a bit unrealistic. M4RKM is right. It\\'s like avoiding \"resort fees\" when the price is $200 and the fee is $25 and going elsewhere and paying $225 (or more!) with no fee.\\nI\\'d prefer places just post the price of food. We paid a 2% \"kitchen surcharge\" at our favorite restaurant last weekend and mentioned to the manager that we\\'d be just as happy if the menu prices went up 2%. She expects that eventually that will happen Thank you, all, for the feedback I imagine many places are just trying to get away with overcharging, but not call it a \"Covid surcharge\". For example, I went to a dive bar in the East Village called Hard Swallow a few weeks ago and they charged me $6 for a PBR can. Thats just ridiculous for a small dive bar. I simply would not return to places that overcharge like that. There are other places that continue to be more fair with their prices. Hi, I am travelling with my boyfriend to America for New Years Eve holiday (both aged 23 years old). I am aware that both destinations are very different - one seems more chill (airbnb in Studio City, LA), the other seems more party (The Evelyn, NYC).\\nWhich destination would people recommend for the holidays?\\nCan you have party and chill in West Hollywood or mainly just chill?\\nWhich place is more expensive spending money wise?\\nWill there be difficulty trying to get bookings in NYC over this busy period?\\nTIA New Years Eve is typically, in non-pandemic times, one of - if not the. - most expensive hotel nights of the year in New York. Perhaps it is possible to find bargains this year, if booking something cancelable about now?\\nHow much of a party scene it\\'ll be by then is sort of hard to tell. Of course, I keep hoping things will be back to some sort of normality by then, but it\\'s hard to tell.\\nI really love both LA and NYC as a tourist - my top two places to visit perhaps in the US. They\\'re very, very different though. For me, New Years Eve in New York would be the pick but I tend to have other priorities than party for New Years Eve (being way older and not much of a party person anymore so that\\'s just me). I went to a gala premiere at Met Opera the one time I spent New Years Eve in New York.\\nEdited: 1:37 pm, April 29, 2021 It does seem like NYC will be reopening more on July 1 though. Don\\'t know if this includes the type of party scene I think you mean. NYC is more expensive in LA in general. I\\'m not sure LA is a major new year\\'s eve. People out west do go to vegas for new years eve. Make sure tickets are refundable. We have no idea what the covid situation will be next December. If given the choice I would say NYC. Someone conflicted between those two very different places would probably want to go to Miami. I had no idea West Hollywood was a happening kind of place on New Year\\'s Eve. The things you learn here. You might be better asking the West Hollywood questions on the Los Angeles forum.\\nIn regards to NYC, The Evelyn is a good hotel, and NYE in NYC is a big celebration especially in Times Square. This year could be even bigger if covid conditions continue to improve.\\nNYC is expensive but if you can get a good cancellable rate now while the city is starting to open up your hotel costs could be lower. Note that the 31st December will probably be more expensive than other dates no matter what.\\nIf nothing else, the weather will be warmer in LA whilst it will be freezing in NYC. That might be a consideration. Travel time is worth considering, too. Especially if you’re only having a few days break.\\nCalifornia vs New York involves 3 more time zones and hours more flying time.\\n( No idea if there will be any direct DUB/LAX flights in December). What you plan on doing is worth considering too ... if you’re planning on seeing the ball drop in time square, plan on standing there all day or you’ll be blocks away; we did it when we were younger (your age) it was fun, but then again we were drunk. East coast, West coast or anywhere in between New Years Eve is usually expensive and bad service, unless your seeing family and friends, for such a far and expensive trip I’d wait until springtime and experience everything NYC has to offer!\\nEdited: 9:27 pm, April 29, 2021 I am planning a surprise trip for my 14 year old twins (boy and girl) for the 2nd week of June. I have never been to NYC before so I am really lost. Being an Arkansas girl...things like the subway aren\\'t familiar to me :) I was looking at staying at the Kimpton Muse Hotel. The things I am interested in are a tour of the 9/11 area, a cruise around the Statue of Liberty, Some type of Observation Deck (Top of the Rock, Edge, etc.), and maybe some type of Marvel/DC Superhero Tour. I was considering getting a New York Go Pass for the 3 days since most of those are covered plus you have access to the Hop On/Hop Off Buses.\\nAny and all advice is appreciated. I like to plan things...not down to the minute but at least into sections like morning/afternoon/night of each of the days. I have no idea how much time to allow for travel or waiting. Also would like to have an idea of how much we will be walking versus riding.\\nAlso suggestions on affordable dining. We aren\\'t picky but would like to try the staples like New York pizza.\\nThanks in advance!!\\nEdited: 2:38 pm, April 09, 2021 How many days do you have?\\nDo you want a tour of the grounds at the 9/11 Memorial Site (under an hour) or the museum too (3+ hours)?\\nDo you want to just see the Statue of Liberty from the water, or do you want to go to the Island and see the statue up close, enter, see the museum on the island?\\nThe best way for people to help you is for you to get a flat map of NYC, put a pin or marker in the places you want to go (and be clear about whether you are happy to see from the outside or go in and tour), come up with a preliminary itinerary, grouping different things you want to see by their proximity to each other. Once you do that and post it, people will be able to tell you if you have too much on one day or not enough.\\nNote, the HopOnHopOff is recommended only for a way to see things, NOT as a means of transportation. It stops too often, gets stuck in traffic, is just much too slow. If you want to do it once, fine, but after that, you will want to use subway, regular buses, or cab/car service. Is the surprise going to be literally when you arrive in NYC? Because I think it would be more fun for them to know in advance, and each plan a couple of things they would like to do. I\\'ve never stayed at the Muse but it is very well located.\\nI would suggest Top of the Rock for the observatory as you can see Central Park and the Empire State Building from it. Another reason for Top of the Rock is that Rockefeller Center is also where you will be able to go to the Nintendo Store and FAO Schwartz, both in the building. I also like the NBC Store.\\nAs for a cruise, I would suggest a sunset cruise, I took one by Circle Line, you leave when the sun is still up and come back when the city is all lit up. You get very close views of the Statue of Liberty.\\nI have visited New York many times and rarely take the subway, walking is easy..\\nThe hotel is close to Midtown Comics which could be a place to check out, but for figurines I would suggest Forbidden Planet (right next to my favorite bookstore, The Strand). In addition to the bad reviews we see for the HOHO buses, the Passes are tough to use because they don\\'t get you reserved times for attractions, just a voucher that you have to trade in for tickets, which may be sold out when you get there. ***I have visited New York many times and rarely take the subway, walking is easy..***\\nI agree that walking is easy, but they\\'re going to need to either take the subway or a cab to get to some of the attractions they have planned based on their hotel location.\\nThe 9/11 Memorial is an open air plaza and you can walk around and spend 30 to 45 minutes for example. The 9/11 Museum deserves 3 hours and is emotionally intense. It could be a bit much for younger teenagers, at least in my opinion.\\nThe Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island could consume between 3 and 4 hours if you want to go there. If you wanted to cruise by, then a paid cruise, like Circle Line, might work for you. The free Staten Island Ferry is another option, but it doesn\\'t get as close as the paid cruises.\\nTop of the Rock is great for an observatory, so is the Empire State Building.\\nFigure out what you want to see and do in regards to the above. If you choose to visit the 9/11 Museum and the SOL/EI, I would split them up over two days. There is so much to see and do downtown. I\\'d suggest a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge and possibly Governor\\'s Island if it interests you. Take a look at this link, there are plenty of other things to fill time:\\nhttps://downtownny.com/explore/plan-your-trip/must-see-downtown/\\nPlenty of options for pizza. For a quick, quintessential NY style slice, Joe\\'s can\\'t be beat in my opinion. Their Carmine Street location is iconic, but they have plenty of other locations, two of which might work for you is the one in midtown on Broadway, between 40th and 41st. It\\'s right by Bryant Park, something else for you to check out. But if you were to be downtown and heading towards the Brooklyn Bridge, they have a location on Fulton St. and Nassau St. For sit down Neapolitan, Don Antonio is great and close enough to your hotel. I think we will tell them in advance but I did want to get the flight and hotel booked before I told them anything for sure. The original plan was to do the 9/11 exhibit but I hadn\\'t really thought about the emotional aspect being too much for them. At the same time, I think its extremely important for them to get the chance to understand all the dynamics of it.\\nI am fine with just cruising by the Statue of Liberty but I love the suggestion of doing it at night.\\nMy husband is interested in seeing the Biggie Smalls mural. Does anyone know if that\\'s in a dangerous area? If not, what\\'s the best way to get there?? Circle Line does an evening cruise which would be really nice on a June evening:\\nhttps://www.circleline.com/sightseeing-cruises/harbor-lights?locale=en\\nFor the mural, it\\'s going to take at least a half an hour to get there. You can take the C train from 42nd street/8th Ave and get off at the Lafayette Ave station in Brooklyn. From the Times Square area, you can also take the Q train to Atlantic Station in Brooklyn (about a 30-40 min ride) and it\\'s just a slightly longer walk to the Biggie mural than the C to Lafayette Station. It\\'s a good neighborhood. Actually, I find that area to be one of the prettiest and most dynamic in the whole city. There are lots of unique stores and restaurants, and surrounding the mural are many streets with beautiful old brownstones. Are your boys interested in trains? There is a great transit museum in Brooklyn. You might also want to consider visiting the Intrepid on the west side. It is a great site to see on a good day. Pam Hi, I am travelling with my boyfriend to America for New Years Eve holiday (both aged 23 years old).

Come on Down!!!\\nBroadway is still up in the air OK- time to plan and schedule I am ok with the whole re-ropening as long as i don\\'t have to go to work all 5 days :) Ha!! My last day in NYC is June 30 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️ I would like to know which airport, JFK or EWR, has the most convenient process to obtain a rental car. We would like to fly into JFK and get a rental car to drive to Cooperstown, but I heard it might be easier to arrive in Newark?? Your thoughts are appreciated. I would expect to save between 30 and 60 minutes of driving time by flying into EWR vs JFK on a trip to Cooperstown.\\nI doubt that the \"rental car experience\" at either airport would differ enough to make up for the fact that difference in driving time.\\nEdited: 4:36 pm, March 29, 2021 Newark is far easier because you do not have to drive through the city. That is if you plan on flying in and hitting the road. EWR seems like it would be an easier drive to Cooperstown Is there more to this? Because unless you have other plans, or the NYC airport prices are too good to refuse, the answer is; None of the above.\\nAlbany is definitely the easiest. Hartford is definitely easier than NYC. Buffalo maybe also but I\\'m kinda guessing on Buffalo.\\nEdited: 5:24 pm, March 29, 2021 Can get reasonably priced tickets for San Jose to Albany What airport are you flying from? Has United resumed service from San Jose to NYC, or will you have to fly from SFO? Note that while United had used EWR exclusively for long haul for past couple years, they recently decided to move some transcon flights back to JFK, as many customers were not interested in EWR. That move was delayed by pandemic, but believe it should be very soon.\\nI have not rented a car in a long time, but when I did rent them EWR was considered to have better selection than JFK, LGA or any locations in Manhattan. So if I were you I would likely fly nonstop into EWR, unless you want to connect somewhere to fly into an airport like Albany.\\nIf UA us offering nonstop service from San Jose to JFK, but not EWR, then you have to decide whether is worth it to have the convenience of not having to travel all the way to SFO but a longer trip once you get here .\\nIf you decide you are willing to connect somewhere to fly into Albany, then you likely have more airline choices. United has already started flying LAX to JFK and SFO to JFK. Think its five times a week for each now and they will increase the frequency in May. Arica,\\nIf you going directly to Cooperstown upon landing (and not spending any time in NYC), it may make sense to fly to one of the Cooperstown area airports from San Jose. no?\\nCH We\\'ve seen a fair amount of people here over the years that come to the city, either at the beginning or at the end of their trip. We have to wait for the original poster to fill us in. But we all agree that renting at Newark is far easier if they\\'re leaving the airport and going to Cooperstown. Thanks for all your input! We have JetBlue credit, so flying into JFK or EWR were our options. I ended up booking a flight to EWR. We will drive to Cooperstown for a week and then return to Manhattan to stay for a couple nights.'"
